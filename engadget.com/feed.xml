Part of the company’s wildly successful Office suite, Word was the de-facto option for drafting text, whether you were an author, an office worker, a student, a teacher… you get the point.</p><p>But <a href="http://googlepress.blogspot.com/2006/10/google-announces-google-docs_11.html">on October 11th, 2006</a>, Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/docs/happy-15-years-google-docs/">officially launched Google Docs and Spreadsheets</a> in beta. As with everything Google, Docs and Sheets were cloud-based applications that also let you collaborate with others in real time. It’s easy to forget now, but this was completely different from how most people worked on documents at the time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b0b1d06ef6c44128a242b15db01697ee"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oX2LeUQbkRc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>I was in a different career 15 years ago, one that required me to work on lots of spreadsheets and Powerpoint presentations that were accessed in a shared network drive. Submitting them to others for edits and notes was a fraught process. Making sure you had the <em>most current</em> version of the document usually involved six-digit numbers representing the last date it was modified, initials to note who had checked it out, and messy notes added to the end until you landed on something insanely convoluted like “April_Report_051504_NI_final_final_reallyfinal.doc.”</p><p>15 years later, I’m writing this story in a Google Doc shared with my editors; they can make as many changes as they want to the finished parts of the draft as I keep typing away here and nothing will get lost. Collaborative work is a lot better than it used to be, and Google Docs is a big part of that – but it wasn’t always smooth sailing to get here.</p><p>Google Docs began as a “hacked together experiment,” its creator Sam Schillace said <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/3/4484000/sam-schillace-interview-google-docs-creator-box">in an interview with <em>The Verge</em> in 2013</a>. Eight years earlier, he created a tool called Writely, a web-based text editing platform. Google bought the company in March of 2006. According to Schillace, 90 percent of the company was using Writely only a month later. “When we went to Google, Writely was internally adopted very quickly,” he said. Barely seven months after that, Google officially released Docs and Sheets at the Office 2.0 Conference in San Francisco. As with most Google products at the time, it was released in beta for free.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/14d3e040-2ac0-11ec-bfff-36d1290dca1b" alt="Google Docs 2006" data-uuid="07b2e948-8d56-3c3d-afc6-8bd1d547e5b8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TechCrunch / Google</div></figure><p>Unsurprisingly, it wasn’t quite up to par with what Microsoft was offering with Office. The text editor was, comparatively speaking, very simple. But more importantly, Google Docs only worked when you had an active internet connection. While good broadband was fairly common in workplaces and universities, it was far less easy to find when you ventured out into the world. If you wanted to get some work while traveling, say on an airplane, Google Docs was a non-starter.</p><p>It didn’t take Google long to realize it needed to come up with a way to sync documents to a computer for offline access. In May of 2007, at its first “worldwide developer day,” the company <a href="http://googlemac.blogspot.com/2007/05/google-gears-for-webkit.html">introduced Google Gears</a>. Gears was an open-source project and browser extension for Mac, Windows and Linux that would help web apps work with no internet connection. While the project was meant for any developer to use, using it for Google Docs made perfect sense.</p><p>Unfortunately, it wasn’t the most stable tool. In late 2009, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-12-01-google-halts-development-of-gears-makes-room-for-html-5.html">stopped development on Gears</a> in favor of using the capabilities afforded by HTML 5. But even though Google continued supporting applications that used Gears, a technology transition probably didn’t do the company any favors in getting Docs and its broader app suite adopted in businesses and education institutions.</p><p>Around this time, Google was experimenting with a variety of ways to push collaboration and communication forward — Docs was just one of the success stories. There were failures though, the most high-profile of which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-08-06-google-wave-dev-preview-hands-on-and-impressions.html">was Google Wave</a> — an ambitious combination of instant messaging, email, documents, multimedia and more. It was hyped by the tech press, so much that Google Wave invites were being sold on eBay. But interest dropped off quickly, in large part because it felt like even less of a finished product than most of Google’s “beta” launches.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e4860ac0-2ac0-11ec-9fef-2885b03e9aad" style="height:533;width:600;" alt="Google Wave 2009" data-uuid="38474f02-1014-35b0-b5b2-fc0dcb6f14f8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google / Engadget</div></figure><p>Google didn’t do a great job explaining exactly what problem this new tool was designed to solve, and the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-08-04-google-wave-flatlines-no-plans-to-further-develop-standalone-pr.html">pulled the plug in 2010</a>, after only a year. But many of the things Google experimented with in Wave ended up living on in other places. Indeed, right around the time Google ended development on Wave, the company added chat to Google Docs, letting people who had the same file open discuss what they were working on right alongside the content itself.</p><p>Google Docs clearly evolved past its early struggles, though. Google put a somewhat surprising amount of focus on the product over the last decade-plus, incrementally iterating and improving it at a steady pace. That’s the hallmark of products Google seems to really believe in. It’s the same way the company treated Android, Chrome (both the browser and OS), Drive, Photos, and, of course, Search and Gmail.</p><p>As internet access has become more and more widespread, the fact that Docs (like most of Google’s products) works best online was less of a hindrance. Not having to worry about saving a document took a while to get used to, but it’s something that we take for granted now — if your browser crashes, whatever you were working on should still be there waiting for you in the cloud.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest endorsement of Google’s cloud-first strategy came in 2010, when Microsoft took its first steps towards bringing Office applications online. For a long time, though, Google’s suite of apps were better-suited to the cloud. For example, you couldn’t have multiple people working on the same Office document until late 2013, something that was built into Google Docs from day one. Apple also followed Google’s lead, bringing its iWork apps online in 2013 and eventually enabling simultaneous collaboration as well.</p><p>While Office remains dominant in the workplace, it’s fair to say that Google gave Microsoft its first real competition in many years. Google has some giant customers, like Salesforce, Whirlpool, Twitter and Spotify. And Google’s apps, combined with inexpensive Chromebooks and its education platform, have made the company a force in the K-12 space as well as in higher education.</p><p>As for the next 15 years, it’s all but assured that collaborative and remote working will continue to be hugely important. That was clear before COVID-19, and the last 18 months have basically blown up the notion that everyone needs to go to an office. For a good idea of where collaborative work is going, consider Microsoft’s open-source Fluid framework. First announced in May of 2019, Fluid is meant to remove the barriers between different file formats and make it easy to pull in content from a wide variety of sources. Microsoft described it as a way to share atomized components of data across multiple files — so if you’re updating a spreadsheet in one document, you can link to that content in another file and it’ll automatically reflect those changes.</p><div id="69ce8eb3782e47feaeaefec800a9feb9"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/10hXCKbfXAM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Dropbox hasn’t come up with its own “atomized components” of documents, but its Paper app works in a similar fashion. They’re collaborative like Google Docs, but they support a wide range of content plug-ins, so you can embed YouTube videos, Google Calendar elements, Figma documents, to-do lists, Trello lists, and even entire Google Docs.</p><p>Microsoft has been deliberate about developing Fluid, taking small steps since its initial release. Earlier this year, the company announced that some Fluid components would work in its communications platform Teams. I think that content moving outside of strict platforms like Google Docs or Microsoft Office into all the other places that we do work is going to be another important step forward.</p><p>That’s already happened to some degree. For years now, Dropbox has supported creating, sharing, and editing Microsoft Office documents right inside its own app and website, and it later added similar support for Google Docs as well. And apps like Slack have a host of integrations for things like Google Drive and Trello, though it’s not clear how widely used or essential they are to a Slack workflow. (I mostly just drop links to Google Docs I need edited.)</p><p>Somewhat ironically, as the barriers between content and file types fall away and more people do work in virtual spaces like Teams and Slack, Google’s vision for Wave looks to be rather prescient. The notion of a space for a project or team that encompasses all of its important elements, be they written documents, spreadsheets, images, videos or any other kind of content seems to be where we’re headed. But despite the fact that Google (and the rest of the industry) are moving back towards models that remind us of what Wave attempted, there’s still a missing piece in Google’s strategy.</p><p>That piece is messaging, something Google has struggled with, well, for about as long as Google has existed. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/08/a-decade-and-a-half-of-instability-the-history-of-google-messaging-apps/">As exhaustively detailed by <em>Ars Technica</em></a>, Google has never been able to stick with a coherent messaging plan for consumers or businesses. At some point, Google Chat (née Hangouts) could have been a solid Slack competitor, as well as the web that connects all the content people work on, but the company missed the boat as Slack solidified its dominance over the past five years. Even though Google Workspace has a huge user base, it hasn’t made inroads in the messaging side — which is what pulls a modern workplace together.</p><div id="fcc329c0de46491198f1bdd50c311d4a"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mlk888FiI8A?start=427" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>That said, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/next-evolution-of-collaboration-for-google-workspace">Google’s Smart Canvas</a> (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-smart-canvas-productivity-app-172323639.html">announced at I/O this year</a>) could be its own version of Fluid, a way to unify disparate forms of content and communication all in one place. From what we’ve seen so far, Smart Canvas has various “building blocks” that you can pull all into a single canvas — like a Meet call alongside a Google Doc for taking notes and a to-do list to assign items to team members. It’s only rolling out on a limited basis to paying Google Workspace customers, but it’s definitely worth watching to see how it evolves.</p><p>No one can really say what other cultural workplace shifts, like those brought on by COVID-19, will happen in the next 15 years. And those shifts are probably what will drive the most significant changes in products meant for work.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-docs-turns-15-190050626.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5449598c-8cae-43aa-af1b-4255803a6507</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 19:00:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633977544</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T18:39:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b5035f60-2abf-11ec-abeb-333bf9215f34" width="2036" height="1124" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b5035f60-2abf-11ec-abeb-333bf9215f34" width="2036" height="1124" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Docs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Docs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Prodigy' is a kid-friendly Star Trek show taking the right lessons from Star Wars]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post keeps spoilers to the bare minimum since the show will not air until October 28th.</em></p><p>While Star Trek certainly has its share of young fans, it’s never been specifically for the kids. Sure, there was the animated show back in the ‘70s, but that was basically a continuation of the original 1966 series. The newest program, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Prodigy" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/n12OYa"><em>Prodigy</em></a>, is designed with kids in mind — especially those who might know nothing about Star Trek.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Though the show won’t show up on Paramount+ until the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-paramount-plus-october-011421132.html">end of the month</a>, fans got a sneak peek at the first episode, “Lost &amp; Found,” during this past weekend&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nycc">New York Comic Con</a>. It introduces to our core cast of characters, a diverse group of aliens trapped on a distant mining colony and forced to dig in search of a mysterious prize. It’s a pretty grim scenario for a kid’s show, but one that won’t stick for long — this is Star Trek, after all, and part of the franchise’s ethos is exploration.</p><div id="892db3493d7449e78739303a663f70b5"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EBE7d8sH5Rg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>To keep the series as newbie-friendly as possible, the connections to the wider Trek universe are kept to a minimum. We don’t even know what species our protagonist, Dal, is. The rest of the cast is filled out by aliens that are either new to us or haven’t gotten a lot of screen time in the past. And the Federation is largely unknown here. Not that it isn’t mentioned a few times, but that our group of former prisoners have no idea what that means. Long-time fans will be excited to watch them learn all about it, while new fans will get to take that journey of discovery with them.</p><p>It’s that sense of wonder that will keep the show firmly in tone with the franchise, even as its new setting and animation style evoke prior science fiction programs like <em>Star Wars: Rebels</em> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Farscape" href="https://amzn.to/2YJ4cwy"><em>Farscape</em></a>. <em>Star Wars: Rebels</em> was also intended as a kid’s show, but its role in filling in details about the rise of the Rebel Alliance and sense of pathos also made it an enjoyable watch for adults. While older Trekkies will probably want to keep up with <em>Prodigy</em> for those ties to the greater continuity, the action sequences are solid and the initial plot line is serious enough to keep newcomer adults engaged. It’s a good introduction to the franchise for both kids and grownups alike, something sorely needed when there’s over 800 episodes to trawl through.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d93c2ae0-2abc-11ec-8bbb-c8689506fc27" style="height:539;width:1200;" alt="Pictured: Environmental coverage of the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Prodigy .

According to Nickelodeon and Paramount Animation president Ramsey Naito, CG was chosen for being the “most immersive approach,” and that director Ben Hibon’s vision for it had a lot of soul. The show adopts a blocky angular style similar to <em>Rebels</em> but the edges are smoother and the color palette is more expansive. Even when things are grim, it’s still a visual treat in terms of how things are shaded. The planet is a full spectrum of browns and reds, while space isn’t just black and white; it’s purple and blue and pink with an array of glittering stars. It’s a cinematic place you want to explore.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/086efe00-2abd-11ec-be5b-16fde7dc0113" style="height:487;width:1200;" alt="Pictured: Brett Gray as Dal of the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Prodigy .

What exactly is the ship, and how did it end up on this depressing mining colony? Those are questions for the long haul. Some may however be answered by the vessel’s “help desk,” a hologram of Kathryn Janeway. She doesn’t have a huge part to play in the series premiere, which is good because it means she can’t draw attention away from the introduction of the main cast. Paramount+ did, at least, release a short clip starring Janeway to quench your thirst for the coffee-swilling captain.</p><div id="741aae83be514228af2b32315cbb96eb"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp2MfWFF2Wk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>During the New York Comic Con panel executive producers Dan and Kevin Hageman did share a few casting announcements. <em>Voyager</em> fans will be pleased to hear that Robert Beltran will be reprising Chakotay. It’s unknown if he’ll appear in the flesh or as another hologram, but we do know that he’s been promoted to captain in the time since his last appearance. Kids will probably be more excited by some of the other guest voices, like <em>Hamilton</em>’s Daveed Diggs as Tysess and <em>The Good Place</em>’s Jameela Jamil as Ascensia. These additional announcements also feel like a tip of the hat to <em>Voyager</em> fans, a show that saw its share of guest stars like The Rock. <em>Prodigy </em>will even bring back Jason Alexander, an actor who also appeared on <em>Voyager</em>, but will now appear in the new role of Doctor Noum.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2d99ae20-2abb-11ec-9a8f-62536ef66906" style="height:500;width:1200;" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY, with series voice cast including &#xe2;&#x80;&#x9c;The Diviner&#xe2;&#x80;&#x9d; (voiced by John Noble) and &#xe2;&#x80;&#x9c;Drednok&#xe2;&#x80;&#x9d; (voiced by Jimmi Simpson) of the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Prodigy .

But as a middle-aged and long-time Star Trek fan, what got me the most in this premiere was when you get to see the <em>Protostar</em> finally fly. Its ascent from the planet was thrilling, but watching the characters react to seeing the stars for the first time… I might have shed a few tears. Star Trek is about exploring strange new worlds, seeking out new life and new civilizations. Now we get to watch a whole new cast, one that had previously been abused and downtrodden, live out that dream. Even if we’ve left the confines of the Federation, the show’s heart is still firmly in place with its past.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-first-look-183049340.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">39ae45ca-6597-422d-b86a-aa4419f5b31d</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 18:30:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633975482</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T18:04:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6ddc7c60-2abb-11ec-b973-37a4d48f7821" width="2999" height="1260" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6ddc7c60-2abb-11ec-b973-37a4d48f7821" width="2999" height="1260" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PARAMOUNT+]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kate Mulgrew as Janeway of Star Trek: Prodigy .

The company has said it’s meant to provide an extra level of scrutiny when those accounts might break the platform’s rules. But according to documents Haugen provided to <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, Facebook often doesn’t review violations from these accounts, effectively allowing them to break its rules without consequences. In other cases, reviews are so delayed that rule-breaking content is viewed millions of times before it’s removed.</p><p>Crosscheck was also a central issue in the Oversight Board’s handling of Donald Trump’s Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html">suspension</a>. The board had asked Facebook for more details about cross check, saying that the company’s rules “should apply to all users.” But Facebook said it was “not feasible” to provide additional info, even though Haugen’s disclosures suggested the company has been tracking problems related to the program.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment. The company said last month, following <em>The Wall Street Journal&#39;s </em>reporting, that it had asked the board to <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/requesting-oversight-board-guidance-cross-check-system/">provide recommendations</a> on how to improve cross check. The Oversight Board will release its first transparency report later this month, which will provide an update on cross check, based on its discussions with Facebook officials and Haugen. The report will be the board’s first assessment of how the social network has responded to its policy recommendations.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-oversight-board-cross-check-180358569.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">690578dc-3587-4088-b7e0-fbe677ba0609</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 18:03:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633978676</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T18:58:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d371e330-2abb-11ec-bb77-88c62ba9f243" width="7712" height="5141" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d371e330-2abb-11ec-bb77-88c62ba9f243" width="7712" height="5141" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[POOL New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies during a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing entitled 'Protecting Kids Online: Testimony from a Facebook Whistleblower' on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., October 5, 2021.

In an interview with <a href="https://www.autonews.com/service/how-ford-helping-ev-owners-charging-stations"><em><ins>Automotive News</ins></em></a>, Ford EV lead Darren Palmer said technicians in specially-equipped <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fords-mach-e-is-a-stylish-and-capable-ev-but-its-no-mustang-153044259.html">Mustang Mach-E</a>s will travel the US to test out charging stations where connected vehicle data and “angry social media posts” indicate they may not be working properly.</p><p>“All they’ll do all day long is go and check them to see where they fail and why,” Palmer told the outlet. “There are a lot of plugs out there, but some of them are old and they don’t have the quality or reliability we want. Over 99.5 percent of customers go into a charger and get a charge. We’re pleased about that. But a number less than that get a charge the first time they charge.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is reportedly finalizing the details of the program but hopes to have the first group of Charge Angels out on the road by the end of the year. Either way, it’s a smart move for an automaker that has a network of approximately 63,000 chargers across the US but ultimately depends on companies like Electrify America and ChargePoint for that infrastructure.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-charge-angels-repair-ev-stations-173442523.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6ddf47f3-32f1-4c55-980a-32d857594b07</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 17:34:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633973687</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T17:34:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/5eae2500-98ac-11eb-bbaf-6c77566a2db9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/5eae2500-98ac-11eb-bbaf-6c77566a2db9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrew Tarantola / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ford Mustang Mach-E]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ford Mustang Mach-E]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook’s Audio hub for podcasts, live chats and more is now live]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/facebook"><ins>Facebook</ins></a> has been making a big push into audio over the past several months.

Governor Gavin Newsom <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/10/09/governor-newsom-takes-final-action-of-2021-legislative-session/">signed a law</a> over the weekend that orders regulators to prohibit the sale of small off-road engines.</p><p>The California Air Resources Board was already working on rules to that effect, but Newsom has given the agency deadlines for adopting and applying the regulations. The agency has until July 1st to adopt the rules. The regulations will apply to engines made on or after January 1st, 2024, or whenever is feasible in the state board&#39;s opinion — whichever is later. <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB1346">The law</a> also stipulates that regulators will need to offer rebates to lower the cost of switching equipment. The latest state budget set aside $30 million to cover the costs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The aim of the law is to reduce emissions. As the <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/10/11/california-lawn-mower-gas-engine-ban/"><em><ins>Associated Press</ins></em></a> notes, California brought in emission standards for those engines in 1990. Although emissions from cars have generally decreased over the last few decades, that hasn&#39;t necessarily been the case for small off-road engines.</p><p>State officials have said that a gas-powered leaf blower that&#39;s used for one hour emits the same level of pollution as a 2017 Toyota Camry that travels for around 1,100 miles. There are currently more than 16.7 million devices with small off-road engines in California — three million or so more than the number of passenger cars in the state.</p><p>California is tackling emissions from gas-powered engines on other fronts. Last year, the California Air Resources Board said all truck and van manufacturers will have to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-push-for-zeroemissions-heavy-trucks-032143253.html"><ins>switch to electric versions</ins></a> by 2045.

Per <a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/10/chevrolet-begins-replacing-batteries-in-recalled-bolt-evs/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;utm_medium=social"><em><ins>Ars Technica</ins></em></a>, GM has started replacing the battery packs of affected vehicles. The automaker is reaching out to Bolt owners with cars manufactured “during specific build timeframes” first. Once you get your EV to a Chevy dealership, the replacement process should take approximately two days. Each new pack comes with an eight-year or 100,000-mile warranty.</p><p>Replacing the battery of every Chevy Bolt manufactured between 2017 and 2019 is expected to cost GM more than $1.8 billion. The fault that led to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-bolt-evs-once-again-over-fire-risks-154033780.html"><ins>fires</ins></a> that necessitated the recall stemmed from a pair of related issues. A problem with the original manufacturing process could cause the battery anodes in affected cars to tear and cathode-anode separators to fold. If both defects came up in the same battery, it would have a higher chance of catching fire.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;LG has implemented new manufacturing processes and has worked with GM to review and enhance its quality assurance programs to provide confidence in its batteries moving forward,&quot; GM said last month when it first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-restarts-production-of-bolt-ev-batteries-following-model-wide-recall-194412215.html">detailed</a> how it would go about replacing batteries. “LG will institute these new processes in other facilities that will provide cells to GM in the future.”&nbsp;</p><p>GM will also start rolling out new diagnostic software in November for all Bolt EVs.

Every. Time.</p><p>This has been my motto while playing the preview build of <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, the latest iteration of Playground Games’ open-world racing series. Horizon is the chill, microdosing cousin of Forza Motorsport, with festival vibes, ridiculous race tracks set in lush environments, and, of course, a virtual garage full of gorgeous vehicles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/478bf7e0-2a23-11ec-bc7b-106779bd1028" alt="Forza Horizon 5" data-uuid="6f129e11-ab2a-3663-9412-0fa0a93d8721"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playground Games</div></figure><p><em>Horizon 5</em> takes place in a fictionalized Mexico, which makes it the perfect stomping ground for the 2021 Ford Bronco, an SUV that I’ve been drooling over for more than a year in real life. It’s the first new model in 25 years, it’s styled after the first-generation Bronco that Ford rolled out in 1965, and, best of all, it comes in a cactus gray colorway. However, for a multitude of reasons — the global chip shortage, supply-chain slowdowns and the sheer expense of it all — I’m not likely to get my feet on the pedals of a new Bronco any time soon. That’s where <em>Horizon 5</em> comes in.</p><p><em>Horizon 5</em> begins with a yellow Bronco Badlands strapped to the floor of a plane, ramp lowered behind it with clear sky soaring by. Starting the game drops the vehicle out of the plane, parachuting you onto the rim of a snow-capped volcano. Immediately, you’re driving at high speeds, following a trail down the fiery mountain and getting a feel for the Bronco. It moves like a heavy piece of machinery, tilting on quick turns and cannonballing down the road, sturdy yet sensitive. (The obligatory, “I like my partners the way I like my SUVs” goes here.)</p><p>And then the next car drops from the sky — a zippy 2020 Corvette Stingray Coupe that drives much differently than the Bronco, turning on a dime and floating over the road. After a few minutes with that, a 1989 Porsche 911 Desert Flyer parachutes past a herd of flamingos, zooming down forest trails with fantastic handling. Finally, the Mercedes-AMG One, a superfast hybrid sports car, finishes the ride by racing an airplane.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e3066fe0-2a21-11ec-b7ff-3a44978edea9" alt="Forza Horizon 5" data-uuid="3aa75bf8-4543-318f-96ba-a3fcd7a95f3f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playground Games</div></figure><p>Each of the starting vehicles has its own sensibilities and strengths. They all finally land at the Horizon Festival, a massive music and racing extravaganza held in the Mexico desert. This is the main hub of the game, and it’s a party atmosphere filled with bright pink signs, crowds of cheering fans and a ceaseless barrage of fireworks, confetti and hot air balloons.</p><p>This is where you’re given the chance to pick a vehicle for the first time, and it’s the origin of my <em>Horizon 5</em> mantra: Bronco. Every. Time.</p><p>It’s not that the Bronco is the fastest or smoothest vehicle in the game, but it feels right rolling through the rugged desert landscape. It’s the vehicle I want to be driving in real life, and it’s incredibly satisfying to maneuver it up winding mountain roads, along charming city streets and into the heart of massive dust storms.</p><p>To be fair, I don’t actually pick the Bronco <em>every</em> time — there are some races that the SUV simply can’t win, given its top speed and wide turns, and for these I’ll happily use one of the sports cars. But when it comes to exploring, I’m all about the Bronco.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6fe9481a698440278068379037cc6518" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe3b28a0-2a21-11ec-bfe6-5a0db367c5ff" alt="Forza Horizon 5"></section><p>That said, all of the vehicles in <em>Horizon 5</em> are magic. They get cracks in the windows and dents in the doors, but they’re truly indestructible and no matter how many backflips they do, they always land tires-down. Plus, if you mess up a turn or run into an immovable object, you’re able to rewind time. In the end, <em>Horizon 5</em> is a cactus-lined fever dream of racing, leaping and crashing, and then resetting and doing it all again.</p><p>The preview includes the first 90 minutes or so of <em>Horizon 5</em>, offering a world map with a handful of races to complete and bonuses to earn by driving around and smashing up the environment. There are multiple layers of customization in the game, from character creation and accessorizing, to vehicle designs and purchases. The preview ends as you unlock your first house of the game, a beautiful pink casita surrounded by cacti and mountains.</p><p>I’m playing <em>Horizon 5</em> on Xbox Series S, the mid-range platform for this title. It’s heading to PC, Xbox Series X and S, and the Xbox One family of consoles, and the main difference among these platforms will be graphical fidelity and loading times. Xbox One players will see loading screens, while PC and Series players won’t, since those platforms can take advantage of SSDs. There’s also no raytracing on the Xbox One versions.</p><div id="279354bf4a5a4349ba2b3cc132e1963f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYH9n37B7Yw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>On Series S, <em>Horizon 5</em> runs smoothly and looks beautiful so far, maxing out at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 and 60fps without raytracing. The final version will be capped at 30fps with raytracing, but this feature wasn’t live in the Series S preview build. Playground Games promises the raytracing mode will be in the Series S edition at launch. Even without the boost, <em>Horizon 5</em> is a treat to look at, with four distinct biomes, dynamic weather and seasons, and dense, lived-in environments.</p><p>After more than a year of restricted travel and stay-at-home orders across the globe, <em>Horizon 5</em> is a delightful, easygoing escape. It’s lighthearted yet intensely detailed, with realistic environments and vehicles, and it offers whatever type of challenge you want. There are multiple difficulty settings for each race, but there’s also the option to just ride around, drive up the side of a volcano or cruise along the beach. <em>Horizon 5 </em>is the escape I need right now, and bonus, I get to do it in the Bronco of my dreams.</p><p><em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>is due out on November 9th and it’ll be included in Xbox Game Pass.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-preview-xbox-series-s-bronco-130028198.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cabb9c83-6162-40db-a939-e4a0b592e9f2</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 13:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633972211</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T17:10:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f0624a60-27b5-11ec-9f5f-c16b0b8b31e8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f0624a60-27b5-11ec-9f5f-c16b0b8b31e8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Playground Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Forza Horizon 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MacBook Air M1 returns to record low of $850 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3oQk4I5">MacBook Air M1</a> combines power and portability into a sleek package, making it one of the best laptops we&#39;ve tried for most people. It normally starts at $999, but Amazon has, once again, knocked the price down to $850. That&#39;s for the 256GB model, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB model" href="https://amzn.to/2YAPcAZ">512GB model</a> is also $150 off, bringing it down to $1,099.

The former comes from Apple&#39;s M1 chipset and you&#39;ll immediately notice the performance gains if you&#39;re coming from an older MacBook. The laptop wakes almost instantly when you open the lid, native apps run smoothly and the machine is, on the whole, quite responsive. The GPU performance is better as well — while we still wouldn&#39;t run intense games on the Air M1, it can handle Apple Arcade titles and even <em>Fortnite</em> easily.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We also appreciate how quiet the MacBook Air M1 is because it lacks a fan inside. You won&#39;t hear constant whirring when you&#39;re putting the laptop through its paces, and you&#39;ll be able to do so for up to 16 hours since the machine has an excellent battery life. The biggest hassles you&#39;ll deal with on the Air M1 are its paltry 720p webcam and its two USB-C ports, the latter of which means you&#39;ll be living the dongle life for a little while longer. But if you can deal with those minor infractions, you&#39;ll still get a solid laptop that can go with you almost anywhere in the MacBook Air M1.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-returns-to-record-low-of-850-at-amazon-122835931.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7176e477-9be3-4b20-8873-486579266528</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 12:28:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633955319</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T12:28:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds drop to an all-time low of $128]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even after two years, Sony&#39;s WF-1000XM3 wireless earbuds are among the best you can buy in terms of sound quality and active noise cancellation.

Pouring on speed, I finally see what all the Mach-E fuss was about.</p><p>Ok so here’s the part of the story where I eat a big plate of crow. When I reviewed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fords-mach-e-is-a-stylish-and-capable-ev-but-its-no-mustang-153044259.html">Mach-E base model back in February</a> I found it to be a perfectly serviceable EV, but more akin to similarly-shaped electric SUVs like the Kia Niro or the Volkswagen ID.4 than the venerated muscle cars I hung posters of in my childhood bedroom. Sure, the pony I drove had plenty of get-up-and-go — EVs are torquey that way — but it never rumbled the depths of my bowels like a naturally aspirated 4-barrel V8 could. The Mach-E GT does. Switch over to the performance-forward Unbridled power management mode — or Unbridled Extend, which optimizes traction and stability control and is great for lapping ICE owners on track day — and the Mach-E GT will haul more ass than <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozvIxnIsn4w">a secret lab overflowing with butt monsters</a>. Stomp on the gas in the 480 horsepower, 600 ft-pound torque GT and this thing will loosen your fillings. Do so in the uber-torqued GT Performance edition and you’re liable to swallow a few teeth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/022b0260-285f-11ec-bfe3-0e988cf5e925" alt="Mustang Mach-E GT Performance edition" data-uuid="4d7ae235-ded4-332b-b0bc-317f00d42205"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>It won’t be difficult to spot the GT and Performance editions on the street. I mean, if the prominent GT badge on the rear liftgate and illuminated Mustang icon on the front grille don’t give it away, both iterations sit about 10 mm lower than the base model and have added styling on the front facia. You’ll also be able to spot them via their wheels as both the GT and the Performance sport unique 20-inch rims (as opposed to the 18s and 19s offered on the base) rocking 245/45R20 Continental all-season tires and fire engine red Brembo brake calipers. On the interior, however, the GT is practically identical to the base model, save for the seats which offer added cushioning and lateral support as there is a better than not chance you’re going to get sideways within the first week of owning one.</p><p>As for driving performance, I’m a bit torn. Nostalgia, as I’ve explained previously, is a hell of a drug and my fondest automotive memories stem from tearing up San Francisco’s streets in a 65 outfitted with a drag racing suspension and a T-10 3-speed, which has deeply biased my understanding of what to expect from the Mach-E. It is, honestly, difficult to reconcile in my head that the Mustang is now an SUV and, despite its overwhelming power, still largely drives like one. Give me a straight shot like, say, that length of highway 101 running through Silva Island towards Larkspur and the GT can, will, and very much did beat the pants off of any Tesla on the freeway as well as one overly confident, tailgating Supra.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0234ed71-285f-11ec-ae67-aa453236e9f5" alt="Mustang Mach-E GT Performance edition" data-uuid="5db7b707-46e4-3d67-922e-edfe4f5a406b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The tight, twisting turns of Highway 1, especially the un-railed cliffside sections where a mistimed tap of the accelerator would fly you clear off a 100-plus foot drop, were a different matter entirely. You can feel the understeer, despite it being an AWD, as well as the GT’s 4,600 pounds of curb weight through hairpin turns. But again it’s an SUV, that’s to be expected — even from one with a sub-4 0-60. The GT’s MagneRide suspension — which leverages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetorheological_fluid">magneto-rheological fluid</a> to stiffen the ride on demand — shined through during those slaloming sections. Even though the wide-bodied GT wallows like a pig in mud through sharp curves, not once did I have to fight the vehicle’s body roll when entering turns.</p><p>The GT starts at $59,900, boasts 480 peak horsepower, 600 lb.-ft. of torque with a 0-60 mph time of 3.8 seconds and an estimated 270 mile range. The GT Performance edition, on the other hand, starts at $64,900, with the same amount of horsepower but a full 634 lb.-ft. of torque and a 3.5 second 0-60 and 260 miles of range.

If you&#39;ve been eyeing a pair but find the $549 price  hard to swallow, take note. Amazon is now selling the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirPods Max" href="https://amzn.to/30ePcHb">AirPods Max</a> in all colors for $100 off at $449, the cheapest price we&#39;ve seen on the site.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/30ePcHb" id="2f43de9d2fe04432b47bf6418ce50958" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple AirPods Max">Buy AirPods Max at Amazon - $449</a><p>The AirPods Max made our latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html">list of favorite headphones</a>, thanks to their high sound quality, effective noise-cancellation and reliable controls. They have an eye-catching design, and despite being slightly heavier than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones-review-150050779.html">Sony’s WH-1000XM4</a> cans, they&#39;re comfortable to wear thanks to the breathable mesh fabric and large ear cups. They have a rotating crown to control sound that&#39;s easy to use, once you get the hang of it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>They have more natural sound than other headphones we&#39;ve tried, with bass that&#39;s prominent but not overpowering. The ANC on Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM4 model is slightly more effective, but the AirPods Max are close, blocking out most environmental noise. Like other AirPods models, the Transparency Mode lets you quickly disable ANC and join conversations. One of the main drawbacks is a lack of lossless audio support, but they do work with with Dolby Atmos spatial audio on most Apple devices.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the AirPods Max really shine if you&#39;re in the Apple ecosystem. With its H1 chip, it&#39;ll quickly pair with and switch between an iPhone and a Mac, for example — letting you quickly go from taking a call to editing video. The regular price of $549 is a lot to pay for that convenience, however, so Amazon&#39;s $100 discount presents a good opportunity to pick up a pair.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-air-pods-max-headphones-are-100-off-at-amazon-085715960.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ba6469e-4722-4554-b081-5340d082fa80</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 08:57:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633942638</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T08:57:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/284e1350-2a6d-11ec-a2ff-ae67d8737c70" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/284e1350-2a6d-11ec-a2ff-ae67d8737c70" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max headphones are $100 off at Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max headphones are $100 off at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gogoro launches its battery-swapping tech in China]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gogoro has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gogoro-launches-battery-swapping-in-china-301396659.html">announced</a> that its hot-swappable battery technology has arrived China and will be compatible with two local scooter brands so far.

The system allows users to buy scooters without a battery, making the initial purchase cheaper. Users then &quot;rent&quot; batteries via a subscription and are charged per Ah of electricity used. When their battery gets low, they can head to a &quot;GoStation&quot; and swap for a freshly charged one in as little as six seconds. The company uses cloud tech to ensure users can find batteries easily and that they don&#39;t overload energy grids.</p><p>The scooters come at a good time in China, which enacted legislation to retire up to 250 million gas- and diesel-powered vehicles by 2025. The launch could also act as a test of Gogoro&#39;s battery swapping tech for future expansions around the world.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gogoro-launches-its-battery-swapping-tech-in-china-080359215.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06c785d3-4184-4df3-9052-d68b0a16ec6d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 2021 08:03:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633939459</ingested><modified>2021-10-11T08:04:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/93c1a380-2a64-11ec-bdff-d3bb45ecbb6a" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/93c1a380-2a64-11ec-bdff-d3bb45ecbb6a" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gogoro]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Gogoro battery-swapping expansion to China]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Gogoro battery-swapping expansion to China]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram will encourage teens to 'take a break']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is trying to mend its reputation in the wake of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">whisleblower Frances Haugen&#39;s testimony</a>, and that includes promises of features lessening the potential harm for teens. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/10/10/dana-bash-presses-nick-clegg-is-that-acceptable.cnn"><em>CNN</em></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-will-try-nudge-teens-away-harmful-content-2021-10-10/"><em>Reuters</em></a> report that Facebook Global Affairs VP Nick Clegg promised Instagram would introduce a &quot;take a break&quot; feature that encouraged teens to simply stop using the social network for a while.

She claimed Facebook was aware its algorithms were destructive, leading children to harmful material and removing only a fraction of hate speech. Haugen also felt Congress should reform the Communications Decency Act&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-s230-repeal.html">Section 230</a> to increase Facebook&#39;s liability for algorithm-chosen content, and that Facebook should add friction to reduce the virality of content and force users to think about posts rather than share them reflexively.</p><p>At the same time, this might not satisfy Haugen and fellow critics. Breaks and nudges may reduce exposure to harmful content, but they won&#39;t remove the content in question. Clegg&#39;s statements also reflect a familiar strategy at Facebook. It likes to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-11-facebook-says-it-needs-more-regulation-not-a-breakup.html">invite regulation</a>, but only the regulation it&#39;s comfortable with.

The <em>AP</em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/dubai-middle-east-united-arab-emirates-eb2461eda153f3bc6ec281e7d1039db9">reports</a> FaceTime calls were suddenly working in the UAE as of October 10th, letting those with the app (not available on Apple gear sold in the UAE) make high-quality video and voice calls. The feature worked when speaking to people both inside and outside of the country.</p><p>It&#39;s not certain if this is a permanent or intentional change. Dubai kicked off Expo 2020 (yes, the city knows it&#39;s 2021) on October 1st, and will keep it running until the end of March 2022 — a gesture like this could encourage visitors who want to keep in touch and show what they&#39;ve seen. The UAE&#39;s Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority has so far been silent about the apparent change, however, and restrictions appear to largely be intact for rival services like Skype and WhatsApp outside of the fairgrounds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Officials have never formally explained the ban. Some have suspected it was a simple effort to protect state-run telecoms&#39; profits, particularly in early years when FaceTime would have consumed a disproportionately large amount of bandwidth. Others, meanwhile, have suspected security concerns. The UAE is believed to have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-30-uae-surveillance-iphone-hacking.html">hacked dissidents&#39; iPhones</a> to spy on their activities, and live video chats might make that surveillance difficult.</p><p>We wouldn&#39;t count on this reprieve lasting long as a result. If this does represent a policy change, though, it could represent either an acknowledgment of changing times or simply a matter of practical necessity. Video calls have often been the only way to see friends and family during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the UAE ban hasn&#39;t helped matters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facetime-calls-uae-155613828.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">41e40b29-75be-4c4f-8fe1-f131e2d3c33a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 15:56:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633881379</ingested><modified>2021-10-10T15:56:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/75e50fa0-29dd-11ec-a64d-608b3ed49778" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/75e50fa0-29dd-11ec-a64d-608b3ed49778" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GCShutter via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Waving to his family from overseas, a young middle eastern man connects with his family via video conferencing late at night thanks to a digital tablet.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arab enjoying his late night video conference]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla's Berlin Gigafactory could produce EVs as soon as November]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-tesla-gigafactory-german-court-permission.html">long-in-the-making German Gigafactory</a> is close to manufacturing its first electric cars.

It&#39;ll help you keep track of your baby&#39;s heart rate, blood oxygen levels and hours slept, with warnings if there&#39;s an unusual spike. While the sock won&#39;t fully replace in-person checks, it could set your mind at ease and let you focus on those moments when you&#39;re truly needed. The third-generation footwear provides quicker, more accurate readings as well as considerably easier charging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With that said, there are no guarantees of a flawless experience. We found the Smart Sock 3 didn&#39;t fit quite as well as its predecessor and was more prone to disconnection alerts. Your circumstances may vary, but don&#39;t be surprised if you get the occasional false alarm. And babies will be babies — there&#39;s the chance your young one will kick the sensor off in the middle of the night.

TSMC would have majority control, according to the insiders, but the plant would operate on Sony land near that company&#39;s image sensor factory. The Japanese government would reportedly cover up to half of the $7 billion investment.</p><p>The plant would provide chips for cameras, cars and other purposes. Accordingly, car parts giant Denso is supposedly interested in the project. If the project moves forward, the factory would be up and running by 2024. Sony and TSMC have declined to comment, although TSMC previously said it was &quot;actively reviewing&quot; plans for an effort like this.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A joint plant wouldn&#39;t be surprising. Some analysts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/the-global-chip-shortage-could-last-until-2023-.html">expect</a> the worldwide chip shortage to last until 2023, and that&#39;s assuming demand doesn&#39;t grow quicker than predicted. This would help Sony, TSMC and the larger Japanese tech industry bounce back from the shortage, not to mention add greater stability. It could also serve as a hedge — Japan, Sony and TSMC wouldn&#39;t have to worry about China-US tensions threatening production in Taiwan.</p><p>The factory might be ready at just the right time.
