In 2021, some of us invested in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">smart home devices</a> and others (re)discovered passions for things like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/libby-app-irl-123053789.html">e-books</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/u-turn-audio-orbit-plus-kanto-yu4-irl-150023872.html">vinyl</a>, but there are plenty of things we bought and loved that didn’t make it onto the site. Here, our staffers look back on the year that was by gushing about their favorite items they bought this year.</p><h2>Dyson V11 Torque vacuum cleaner</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d336c5f0-5d03-11ec-9fbf-4f1ba03a4761" alt="Someone stands while using the Dyson V11 Torque stick vacuum cleaner in their brightly lit living room." data-uuid="91b63469-bb99-3d7e-a389-8e1f0f17ed43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dyson</div></figure><p>After a few years of waffling, I finally pulled the trigger in 2021 and bought a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Dyson stick vacuum" href="https://fave.co/3Afo1Z9">Dyson stick vacuum</a>. You could say I fell for the hype, but honestly it’s been one of my favorite purchases of the year and arguably the most useful. Until now, we had been relying on a few-years-old Roomba (lovingly named Dale) to clean our two-bedroom apartment — Dale did a good job, but the Dyson is even better. Sure, we have to actually vacuum ourselves, but both my fiancé and I find the task soothing (while our cat finds it absolutely horrific).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The hype is real when it comes to the power of Dyson stick vacuums. The V11 Torque sucks up nearly anything and everything in its path, including the masses of cat hair hiding in our carpet. I like how the machine automatically adjusts the suction power when it moves from carpet to hard flooring, and its three modes let you control how powerful it is to begin with. The LCD screen also shows how long the battery will last in each mode, and it’s good enough that I’ve never had to stop cleaning in order to power up. Maybe that will change if and when we move into a larger home, but even then, it’ll be a small price to pay for tidy goodness. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:My vacuum" href="https://qvc.uikc.net/do5AQ7">My vacuum</a> also came with a bunch of attachments, so the machine transforms from a full-sized vac to a handheld with just a few snaps. That lets me clean around my couch and the couch itself — a joy that 29-year-old me might not have appreciated, but one that 30-year-old me relishes in. —<em> Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><h2>Sonos Roam</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/e4a2ba60-9eae-11eb-9d7f-ffaefec668fa" alt="Sonos Roam portable speaker outside, standing vertically on a wooden railing." data-uuid="6212097b-c57d-3a99-bee0-8813851e0eb4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I bought the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Sonos Roam" href="https://fave.co/3uZmWUl">Sonos Roam</a> with one primary purpose in mind. In Canada, the early stage of the vaccine rollout was delayed compared to how it played out in the US. As a result, most restaurants and bars either weren’t open or operating at full capacity in the late spring and early summer. And so, for the second year in a row, it looked like any hangouts I would have with my friends would be outside. I figured the Sonos Roam would make those more fun, and I was right.</p><p>Everytime I brought it with me to a park hang, my friends would remark how great it sounded. And that’s the best compliment you can give the Roam. It’s small and compact, making it easy to bring with you on any adventure, but more than anything, it sounds way better than any Bluetooth speaker of its size has the right to sound. Because of that, I ended up using the Roam a lot more than I thought I would. It was my constant companion through the summer and fall months, providing a soundtrack when I had to cook dinner, clean my bike or host friends for a patio party. If music is how we decorate time, the Roam did an incredible job of it. <em>– Igor Bonifacic, Associate Editor</em></p><h2>Toro UltraPlus leaf blower and vacuum</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4e8c8a70-59ec-11ec-bf2d-8049d6e2bcfa" alt="Toro UltraPlus leaf blower" data-uuid="8cf91381-05e5-38bb-b677-49daf28e75df"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Toro</div></figure><p>As I&#39;ve acclimated to the grind of yard work, a part of me feels like I&#39;m transforming into <em>King of the Hill&#39;s</em> propane-selling, tool-loving Hank Hill. That realization struck me pretty hard this fall, as I prepared to brave another onslaught of leaves from the enormous trees around my house. Last year, it typically took me around two hours to rake and bag everything from my tiny front yard. I just couldn&#39;t go through that again. So I decided to buy a leaf mulching vacuum – and it was the best decision I&#39;ve made all year.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Toro UltraPlus" href="https://amzn.to/3DEs7vo">Toro UltraPlus</a> (model 51621) looks like a typical leaf blower, but it does so much more, <em>I tell you what</em>. Its vacuum attachment can suck up an enormous pile of leaves in minutes, and its metal impeller grinds it all up into a fine pulp. Best of all, once its mulching bag is full, I can just unzip it to dump out the contents into a yard waste bag, or directly over a portion of my garden. Thanks to the Toro, I was able to clean my entire front yard in under 30 minutes. Getting that free time back was easily worth $100.</p><p>Like most consumer-grade yard gadgets, the Toro UltraPlus has its share of downsides. Its leaf blowing is hilariously weak – at full blast, it sometimes had trouble moving just a handful of leaves. That&#39;s okay with me, since I also hate the relentless drone of leaf blowers in the suburbs. (And yes, its mulching feature is pretty loud as well, but at least that works quickly.)</p><p>My biggest worry about the UltraPlus is that it&#39;s almost entirely made of plastic. It feels like it’s only a matter of time until the tab that holds in the vacuum tube breaks off. As a plug-in tool, it&#39;s also annoying to juggle a long extension cord while I&#39;m trying to beautify my yard. I can live with that inconvenience, though, as cordless leaf vacuums typically cost over $400.</p><p>Given how much the Toro UltraPlus has changed fall cleanup for me, I’ll probably just buy another if my curent one breaks. And who knows, maybe it’ll last long enough for my daughter to start helping out with yard work. (They make rakes for three-year-olds, right?) <em>– Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em></p><h2>Apple Watch Series 7</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed61c5f0-2c26-11ec-bfff-fc22ded728bb" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" data-uuid="1d655e2c-8b3a-3503-8b51-0323f1a2e97f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I’ve been reviewing various generations of the Apple Watch for Engadget <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-02-the-apple-watch-as-a-fitness-device.html">since the original debuted back in 2015</a>. It was always the same routine: I would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-24-apple-watch-series-5-review.html">wear the thing for weeks</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-16-the-best-gps-running-watches-for-2019.html">take it on runs</a> and become obsessed with closing my rings. And then, I’d send my loaner unit back to Apple, and return to life as someone who wore an ugly, not-very-smart watch, or sometimes no watch at all.</p><p>2021 was the first time I felt compelled to buy one for myself. I wish I could say there was something particularly compelling about the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Series 7" href="https://amzn.to/3DtdTgQ">Series 7</a>. But it’s actually a lot like the Series 6, and I knew that when I bought it. No, I got an Apple Watch mostly because I was fed up with my trusty Garmin. It was never pretty – utilitarian at best – but it became decidedly less so when I broke the strap. Yep, I paid $399 for the Apple Watch because I wanted something stylish that would count my steps.</p><p>I’m mostly happy with it. The beige (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:&#x00201c;Starlight&#x00201d;" href="https://amzn.to/3DtdTgQ">“Starlight”</a>) color scheme goes with everything. I love unlocking my MacBook with the watch instead of being forced to type a long password on Apple’s unreliable Butterfly keyboard. And the automatic workout detection is as precise as I remember it, gently tapping me on the wrist a few minutes into each of my daily walks.</p><p>The biggest issue is my nightly routine of fighting with the watch over how many hours I spent standing throughout the day. The sensor is mercurial and erratic, ignoring the time I spent literally standing at the stove, or even a long series of squats, but sometimes rewarding me for sitting on my butt. Whatever, Apple: I know how long it took me to make that squash for Thanksgiving – and I have photos of the burn marks to prove it. <em>— Dana Wollman, Editor in Chief</em></p><h2>Durablow gas fireplace smart remote control</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/91181ac0-59ed-11ec-b71c-12adb0f0592c" alt="Durablow gas fireplace smart remote control" data-uuid="1c876ba0-e9a5-319c-be30-4fe1c863a487"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Durablow</div></figure><p>I live in a quintessential drafty San Francisco apartment. We have central heat, but my partner and I both have allergies and our furnace seems to do a better job at distributing dust around the house than keeping it warm. Which means in the winter months (and, often in the spring and summer too, because San Francisco) we use our gas fireplace to help keep things cozy. We use it so much that we started wishing we could control it from any room in the house. We have smart lights and other devices connected to our Google Home speakers, so why not the fireplace?</p><p>That’s where <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Durablow&#x002019;s WiFi-enabled fireplace remote" href="https://amzn.to/3pwopPy">Durablow’s WiFi-enabled fireplace remote</a> comes in. For about $70, the gadget turns any gas fireplace into a smart fireplace. (We use Google Assistant, but it’s also compatible with Alexa and other smart home systems.) The setup itself was fairly painless: it required connecting one set of wires to the gas valve, and downloading an app to pair the receiver with a Google account. Once it’s paired, you can control the fireplace with voice commands from your smart speaker.</p><p>That may sound like a needless amount of effort for something we can also control from a switch on the wall, but after another year spent (mostly) at home, I can safely say rigging Durablow remote control was life changing. Having it connected to our Google Home system means we can turn the fireplace on from any room, which is especially nice in the early mornings when the living room would otherwise be freezing. We can even activate from the Google Home app on our phones when we’re on our way home on a chilly night, brr. <em>– Karissa Bell, Senior Editor</em></p><h2>Bombas Performance Running Quarter socks</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/aedb1080-5d03-11ec-bfbb-92c873760cbc" alt="Bombas Performance Quarter Running Socks" data-uuid="85439305-11ba-37ea-82a4-d4054f609a74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bombas</div></figure><p>I’ve always had really bad luck with socks, and that might be because I typically bought the cheapest ones I could find. I regularly fought to keep ankle socks from falling down and, after particularly long days in not the best shoes, the backs of my heels would be screaming with cuts and blisters. And I detest nothing more than feeling my sock slip down into the depths of my sneakers in the middle of a run.</p><p>Ultimately, I caved and decided to give <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Bombas&#x002019; running socks" href="https://fave.co/3G2Jp74">Bombas’ running socks</a> a try, and I went with the quarter length because they seemed to be the best option for all kinds of runs. Well, you get what you pay for, folks. These are, without a doubt, the best running socks I’ve ever had — they don’t move around, they don’t slip and they keep my toes fairly warm even during late-November morning runs. They’ve become one of those staples in my wardrobe that are so good precisely because I barely notice them, which is in stark contrast to the cheap socks that always demanded more of my attention than I wanted to give. —<em> V.P.</em></p><h2>Astrohaus Freewrite</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" alt="The Freewrite standalone word processor with keyboard sits on an office desktop." data-uuid="5b5e47ab-6e73-3ff6-8d92-29d9a5292fe7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>My first impression of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Freewrite smart typewriter" href="https://bit.ly/3It2Nfq">Freewrite smart typewriter</a> from Astrohaus was one of confusion. I had the feeling that I was looking at a $600 solution searching for a problem. For as much as a modest Windows laptop, the Freewrite combines a small E Ink display with a mechanical keyboard and the ability to sync whatever you write to the cloud. It’s a very simple product that sets out to do one thing well: offer an excellent, distraction-free environment for drafting text. As such, there are no bells and whistles here — it’s minimalism taken to the extreme.</p><p>Under almost any circumstance, this product would make no sense. But, during the pandemic, I got an itch to try my hand at some different writing — fiction, essays, just something different from what I do for work. That’s when the Freewrite started calling me. Despite the high price tag, I became enamored with its beautiful design and imagined using it to bang out words without being distracted by Twitter, the vast expanses of the internet or my colleagues on Slack.</p><p>As expected, no piece of hardware is enough to turn anyone into a novelist. But the Freewrite is a delightful product because of its simplicity. In the era of multi-use gadgets, it’s rare to come across something that focuses on doing one thing exceedingly well. But that’s what the Freewrite does. Its keyboard is a joy to use and the E Ink screen is a smart choice for a device like this. Coming from a laptop it takes a few minutes to get used to the refresh rate, but the basic black-and-white is perfectly suited for text. The Freewrite isn’t for everyone — but if you make a living writing (or are just passionate about it as a hobby), it’s a device worth considering. <em>– Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Managing Editor</em></p><h2>Nintendo Switch OLED edition</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d84c0a70-261a-11ec-96f7-64f681b232c1" alt="Samus Aran in a save point" data-uuid="8a9e92ef-6479-3f13-b836-41eff1ff99e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Sure, it’s not the Pro model I hoped for, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:OLED Switch" href="https://amzn.to/3E70qvF">OLED Switch</a> offers the definitive Nintendo experience (for now). This is doubly true if you spend most of your Switch time in handheld mode.</p><p>With a bigger seven-inch, higher-contrast OLED display, all of my games look better on the new Switch, without exception. And I get to play it for longer without charging, despite the same specifications and even battery size. The longer battery life appears to be due to the virtue of a less power-hungry OLED screen, and coming from the original launch model, where I was lucky to eke out 4 hours on games like<em> Super Mario Odyssey </em>or<em> Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, it’s a genuine improvement for me, as I love to used to travel with my Switch everywhere. I love the white Joy-Cons, but I’m afraid to wear them out or get them dirty. But that’s my problem.</p><p>Most have said it’s a nice, if inessential, upgrade for existing Switch owners – but if you typically play untethered from a TV, the OLED model is, for me, a substantially better console. Contingent on Omicron’s movements, my OLED Switch will soon have its first test – a long-haul flight to Las Vegas. <em>– Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><h2>PopSocket MagSafe grip with Smartish phone case</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ec88ce80-59ee-11ec-afe9-0d51f41b5dd9" alt="PopSocket MagSafe Grip" data-uuid="1e24c47a-d0a8-3281-ba39-c94747b8c76d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">PopSocket</div></figure><p>For many years now, I’ve been a big fan of PopSockets, those round plastic extendable discs you stick on the back of your phone. I didn’t really <em>want</em> to like them – I do admit they’re pretty bulky – but they’re surprisingly useful. They make it a lot easier to hold a slim and slippery phone one-handed, plus they do a decent job propping up your phone, too. There’s one major downside though: Reusing them – taking them off and putting them on again – was not something you wanted to do very often, as the gel adhesive gets less sticky over time.</p><p>But this year I got myself the new iPhone 13, which supports MagSafe. Now, instead of a normal PopSocket, I could use the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:PopGrip for MagSafe" href="https://amzn.to/3Gzo1a1">PopGrip for MagSafe</a>, which simply attaches magnetically onto the phone. Reusing it is as simple as pulling it off and putting it on again, no need for a sticky adhesive. I still wanted a case for my phone to protect it against the occasional fall, so I made sure to get a MagSafe-compatible one. I ended up choosing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:this floral Smartish case" href="https://amzn.to/3oBDbVZ">this floral Smartish case</a> because I liked the look of it. And yes, the PopGrip works fine with it on.</p><p>I know it sounds silly, but I just absolutely love this combination of the Smartish case and the PopGrip MagSafe. The case has a nice texture that makes it feel more secure, and I just love that I can put on and take off the grip as many times as I want without worrying about destroying any adhesive. And I do this more often than you’d think – I usually take it off to power up the phone on my wireless charger, and pop it back on for the rest of the day. I like to joke that this accessory is my number one reason for getting a new iPhone – and not, you know, all the other good things about the phone itself – but honestly, it’s probably not far from the truth. <em>– Nicole Lee, Senior Editor</em></p><h2>Wahoo Kickr Smart Bike Trainer and Zwift</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c8a41a60-5cfa-11ec-b7e7-c24283399beb" alt="An in-home setup for Wahoo Kickr Smart and Zwift showing a bike and TV." data-uuid="1ffb370a-8c89-3b22-9ef3-b12553f0480c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>I spent the summer of 2020 cycling around my Brooklyn neighborhood most days to keep in shape. But with a long winter looming and growing tired of the chaos in the streets, I decided to cough-up some cash for a home fitness solution. After much deliberation, I settled on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Wahoo Kickr Smart" href="https://fave.co/3oGcI9O">Wahoo Kickr Smart</a> bike trainer. It’s one of the pricier models at $1,200, but its folding legs, subtle tilt range, low noise output and top specs seemed future-proof. Paired with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Zwift" href="https://fave.co/3ydg8Us">Zwift</a>, a massively multiplayer online cycling and running app ($16/month), I now had the biking sim I’d always wanted and an exercise setup that’s season agnostic.</p><p>The Kickr Smart is relatively compact with a handle and folding legs for stowing away during downtime. It’s direct-drive for use <em>with</em> your bike instead of being a space-hogging standalone device. You remove your back wheel, lock into place and use the unit&#39;s own (upgradable) gear cassette so you’ll be able to shift gears normally. This allows for quick release, so you can still ride your bike outdoors on a whim, although my road bike has been in position for a while now.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/196910c0-5cfd-11ec-8ffd-fe53e6c440c3" alt="A screenshot from the cycling sim Zwift showing the Neokyo city environment." data-uuid="7fecfadd-d0b3-36cb-acdb-c8a085d54f88"><figcaption>An in-game POV screenshot from Zwift&#39;s Makuri Islands: Neokyo expansion.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>I run Zwift on an Apple TV, which connects to the Kickr Smart via Bluetooth and includes power, cadence and speed tracking. I set up in front of a flatscreen for full POV immersion in one of the various virtual worlds offered, including the new <a href="https://www.zwift.com/neokyo">Neokyo cityscape</a>. I also have a fan (it’s a sweat fest) and a table for water, snacks and my phone since I use the Zwift <a href="https://www.zwift.com/companion">companion app</a> for features not readily accessible on the Apple TV. The experience is a combination of fitness and gaming in a form factor that closely enough resembles outdoor riding.</p><p>The Kickr Smart trainer adjusts resistance to simulate terrain from flat to climbs and downhill. There are tons of gamified features, long-term goals and you’re virtually alongside riders from around the world. You can set structured workouts and join races, but I’m just there to ride and only interact with others on occasion to give “ride ons” — a sort of thumbs up.</p><p>I’ve gone from eight miles during my lunch break to waiting until the evening to fit in fifteen or more, which seems like the minimum these days. My goal wasn’t really to train, but it’s been compelling enough that I&#39;ve steadily increased my distances and climbs.</p><p>I’ve been riding year-round, about five days a week and I have to say it’s (a lot of) money well-spent, both for fitness and mental health. There are no spin-class tyrants shouting at you, just some gamified nudges and your own desire to ride. <em>– Jon Turi, Homepage Editor</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/what-we-bought-our-favorite-gadgets-of-2021-irl-140052965.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">adb1eddb-cf3d-4fc1-9eb6-05dc40f8a9c7</guid><dc:creator>Engadget</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 14:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639766722</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T18:45:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Engadget]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" width="2000" height="1234" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" width="2000" height="1234" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Freewrite standalone word processor with keyboard sits on an office desktop.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Freewrite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG's first gaming laptop comes with an NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU and 11th-gen Intel CPU]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG is best known for productivity-oriented laptops and particularly, its lightweight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-lg-gram-17-review-price-specs-big-screen-thin-light.html">Gram 17</a> — but not any serious gaming models.

To start with, the Standard Range model, with a projected 230 miles of range, will come with a 98 kWh battery pack. Meanwhile, the optional Extended Range version (300 miles targeted) will have a massive 131 kWh battery.&nbsp;</p><p>The Standard Range package will be the main offering on the first three of four versions: the fleet-oriented Lightning Pro, the XLT and the Lariat. The Extended Range is optional for the XLT and Lariat, and standard on the top-end Platinum model. Ford said that the &quot;F-150 Lighting Pro model will be available with the standard-range battery to retail customers,&quot; but it <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/05/24/all-electric-f-150-lightning-pro.html">previously said</a> that it would be available with the Extended Range option for fleet buyers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ford also revealed that the power fold mirrors would only be available on the Lariat and Platinum models, and that the Tough Bed spray-in bed liner is not standard, but an available option on all trims. Other options we already knew about include a high-powered 9.6 kW Pro Power system for the first two trims (it&#39;s standard on Lariat and Platinum) and 15.5-inch touchscreen with Sync 4A, available on the upper trim levels.</p><p>Ford has yet to reveal exact retail prices, but it previously said that the Standard Range Lightning Pro will start at $39,974 before any tax incentives for commercial buyers, while the Extended Range model (again only for fleet buyers) will start at $49,974. Retail prices are expected to start at $42,000 and top out at $90,000 for the Platinum model. That&#39;s a fair bit higher than the $28,000 base price for an F-150 ICE version, but then again, most folks pay <a href="https://www.kbb.com/reviews/pricing-your-next-ford-f-150-it-could-cost-60000-or-more/">considerably more than that</a> on average.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the large battery sizes, Ford&#39;s prices actually seem surprisingly reasonable. By comparison, Hyundai&#39;s <a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/vehicles/kona-electric">Kona Electric</a> has a much smaller 64 kWh battery and starts at $34,000. We should know the exact F-150 Lightning prices soon, as Ford said in the livestream that order banks would open in January 2022. Currently, it has 200,000 pre-orders in hand, and recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-stops-f-150-lightning-reservations-at-200000-192434385.html">cut off</a> further reservations.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-ev-pickup-98-kwh-131-kwh-batteries-092329022.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1cc737b-5811-466d-b529-42da19288e19</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 09:23:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639992736</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T09:32:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b6f75c0-616f-11ec-8b7e-aba0cee9ea46" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b6f75c0-616f-11ec-8b7e-aba0cee9ea46" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ford's F-150 Lightning will come with 98 kWh and 131 kWh battery packs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ford's F-150 Lightning will come with 98 kWh and 131 kWh battery packs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Malaysia's updated copyright law imprisons streaming pirates for up to 20 years]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Illegal streaming could be particularly costly in Malaysia. <em>TorrentFreak</em><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/malaysia-passes-bill-to-imprison-illegal-streaming-pirates-for-up-to-20-years-211218/">reports</a> the country has passed <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Parlimen-CopyrightAct1987-ammendment-dec21-01.pdf">amendments</a> to its Copyright Act that punish those who enable pirate streaming.

The two have <a href="https://twitter.com/youtubetv/status/1472657141789904899?s=21">struck</a> a deal that restores access to ESPN, FX and other Disney channels on YouTube&#39;s streaming service. Local ABC stations will come back over the course of the day (December 19th), but you may already see access to any recordings of Disney-owned channels.</p><p>The base subscription rate is returning to $65 per month, but YouTube TV promised that &quot;all impacted members&quot; would still receive a one-off $15 discount. More details would be coming through email, the service said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Disney channels vanished on December 18th after the media giant and YouTube TV failed to reach an agreement on channel carriage fees. As is often the case with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-returns-to-dishs-lineup-after-protracted-dispute-is-resolved-061504019.html">disputes like this</a>, each side blamed the other.

The service has traded blows with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-tv-nbc-universal-dispute-resolved-200510827.html">NBCUniversal</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-05-youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-yes-network.html">Sinclair</a>, for instance. With that said, the Disney fight may have been one of its most important.

The principal investigator for NASA&#39;s Juno mission, Scott Bolton, has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html">produced</a> an audio recording of magnetic field activity around <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html">Jupiter&#39;s moon Ganymede</a> as the Juno spacecraft flew past on June 7th, 2021. The 50-second clip reveals a sharp change in activity as the probe entered a different part of Ganymede&#39;s magnetosphere, possibly as it left the night side to enter the daylight.</p><p>The audio came from shifting electric and magnetic frequencies into the audible range. Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere dominates that of its moons and is present in the recording, but Ganymede is the only moon in the Solar System to have a magnetic field (likely due to its liquid iron core). This isn&#39;t a feat you could replicate elsewhere in the near future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The soundtrack was part of a larger Juno briefing where the mission team revealed the most detailed map yet of Jupiter&#39;s magnetic field. The data showed how long it would take the Great Red Spot and the equatorial Great Blue Spot to move around the planet (roughly 4.5 years and 350 years respectively). The findings also showed that east-west jetstreams are ripping the Great Blue Spot apart, and that polar cyclones behave much like ocean vortices on Earth.</p><p>You wouldn&#39;t hear these sounds if you could visit Ganymede yourself. However, they&#39;re a reminder that even seemingly dead worlds are frequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-03-nasa-mars-quake-sounds.html">brimming with activity</a> you can detect using the right instruments.

It starts at RMB 328,000 (about $51,450), or well under the roughly $70,000 of the ET7, but offers similarly grandiose range figures. Nio claims the base 75kWh battery offers over 341 miles of range using China&#39;s test cycle, while the highest-end 150kWh &quot;Ultralong Range&quot; pack is supposedly good for more than 620 miles. You&#39;ll likely pay significantly more for the privilege and may not see that range in real life, but the numbers could still tempt you away from higher-end Model 3s if long-distance driving is crucial.</p><p>You can expect the usual heapings of technology. The ET5 will have built-in support for autonomous driving features as they&#39;re approved, and drivers get a &quot;digital cockpit&quot; thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-us-verizon-140017764.html">Nreal</a>-developed augmented reality glasses that can project a virtual screen equivalent to 201 inches at a 20-foot viewing distance.

The brand only expanded to Norway in 2021, but it aimed to begin sales in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden in 2022. You should see the badge in 25 countries and regions by 2025. While Nio still won&#39;t count as automotive heavyweight by that stage, it could easily put pressure on other EV makers within a few years.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nio-et5-ev-190702131.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ba0272c7-e02c-40a6-9b5b-53327d2417c0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 19:07:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639854425</ingested><modified>2021-12-18T19:07:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c47225e0-602e-11ec-bfeb-6df5188a862b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c47225e0-602e-11ec-bfeb-6df5188a862b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nio]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nio ET5 EV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nio ET5 EV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Toyota cars don't include remote starting on key fobs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Current Toyota drivers might not be thrilled about having to subscribe <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-key-fob-remote-start-function-requires-subscription-111606852.html">just to remotely start</a> from their key fobs, but what about new buyers?

This week, we’ve got a new addition to the <em>Halo </em>series with <em>Halo: Infinite, </em>which Jessica Conditt says fits right in with the rest of the franchise. Terrence O’Brien played the Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster and reported that the hybrid instrument produces convincing acoustic sounds that echo the original guitar. James Trew used the Analogue Pocket and says it’s the best handheld retro experience available right now, period. And Billy Steele listened to Yahama’s YH-L700A, which he deemed a bit heavy-handed, albeit excellent for movie watching.</p><h2>The Yamaha YH-L700A headphones have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-yh-l700a-review-130056716.html">a unique aesthetic and a high price</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a73df20-592e-11ec-8375-2a72806c444d" alt="Yamaha YH-L700A review" data-uuid="a74a6e50-f9ad-3c8b-95a6-9bffa0a47b49"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Billy Steele likes the look of the <a href="https://amzn.to/3F6mW96">Yamaha YH-L700A</a> headphones: he says the combination of leather, fabric, matte black and silver accents makes for a refined look while the square fold-in ear cups make them easy to travel with. The noteworthy feature on these headphones is the 3D Sound Field feature, which consists of seven presets to enhance music and movies. There’s also a head-tracking feature which makes the sound appear to be coming from a stationary point.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Billy says this last feature added a cinematic element to movie watching, but he didn’t think it translated when listening to music. The seven presets of the 3D Sound Field likewise worked better for movies and television where they created a spacious sound. While testing the filters with music, Billy reports they felt  heavy-handed and didn’t work well across genres. He says the active noise cancellation on these cans is sufficient if not impressive, and points out that the marquee features can be toggled on and off within the app. However, he was disappointed with the battery life – during testing, the headphones managed to last just under 11 hours, which is lackluster when most of the competition boasts closer to 30 hours of battery life. And at $500, they have a high price tag to boot.</p><h2>The Analogue Pocket offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011.html">all the fun of ‘90s portable gaming</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5fc6b9e0-5f7e-11ec-bccb-885439fe0e1d" alt="Analogue Pocket" data-uuid="ecd007be-d945-3497-90d7-0621f0a9cee2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew/Engadget</div></figure><p>James Trew is a long-time vintage gaming fan and is quick to point out that while the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a> is the best experience available right now, it’s also not for casual users. At $220, it lets you play most vintage portable titles from Game Boy, as well as Game Gear, while adapters for Neo Geo Pocket Color and Atari Lynx are on the way. It also has more modern touches, too, like a backlit display. And in addition to being a quality gaming device, the Analogue Pocket can also hook up to a TV and has built-in music making software.</p><p>Because of its FPGA “cores,” the Pocket can mimic vintage consoles at a hardware level – no more emulator quirks to suffer through. It’s also functional with original Game Boy accessories like the Game Boy Camera, printers or rumble packs. And it can connect to an authentic Game Boy for a multiplayer experience. James liked the 3.5-inch screen made with Gorilla Glass as well as the save states, but wished the shoulder buttons were better and said some of the display modes obscure on-screen messaging at times. Overall, the Analogue Pocket offers elevated retro gameplay with enough forthcoming additional features to ensure it will get better over time.</p><h2><em>Halo: Infinite </em>has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-review-campaign-xbox-microsoft-080158610.html">fun new mechanics and tools</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8e4d2060-5f7e-11ec-8625-35a59187b28e" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="ffbcc3f9-0632-3493-80a5-cfc635241b40"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Jessica Conditt had high hopes for <a href="https://amzn.to/3sgVF0k"><em>Halo: Infinite</em></a><em>, </em>the first open-world game in the franchise’s history. And she admits that playing the new storyline brought back warm, gleeful feelings and a sense of familiarity. However, she also thinks the game lacks surprise and intrigue – much of the innovation into vertical space has been done by other, more recent games, and the cramped map made for contained and linear gameplay.</p><p>That being said, Jessica reports she had a lot of fun playing with the newly available mechanics and tools, in particular the grapple hook. From climbing mountains to scaling buildings, the grapple hook provides new vertical space for players to explore. Jessica says that while she expected a lot more from the pioneer FPS title, she also thinks it’s at its best when it gives users a rich environment full of grappling, shielding and in-air headshots. From the maze-like levels, military stereotypes and sarcastic robots, <em>Infinite </em>plays like a classic Halo game.</p><h2>The Hydrasynth Explorer offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hydrasynth-explorer-review-wavetable-synthesis-183026724.html">an endless array of synth options</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c5da5160-5f7e-11ec-af4f-5fa3df46f039" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="5e6b7073-336d-3036-be27-904697348370"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien admits up front that the <a href="https://fave.co/3GPVgG7">Hydrasynth Explorer</a> offers a remarkable array of features and options in a portable, well-built device. For $600, you get a wavemorphing engine with an eight-note polyphone, three oscillators per voice, a ring modulator, a noise source and over 200 waveforms. There are also two filters which can be in series or parallel to determine how much of each oscillator goes to each filter. He says that the 88-page manual feels like it’s just skimming the surface of what the synth is capable of.</p><p>However, you don’t need to master the sound design tools to get started with the instrument – just dig into the 640 presets spread over five banks of 128 patches. During testing, Terrence found the Explorer easy to use thanks to the neatly labeled sections on the front panel. A few things missing on the versatile device are a proper sequencer, full-sized keys, and touch strips instead of pitch and mod wheels. There are also only three filter knobs instead of five. Despite that, Terrence still feels that the Explorer is well worth its price tag given its great sound, solid build and plethora of tools to explore.</p><h2>Fender’s Acoustasonic Player Telecaster is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fender-acoustasonic-player-telecaster-hybrid-guitar-hands-on-183045383.html">an (almost) perfect couch guitar</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f7a4bf50-5f7e-11ec-8ffd-c0f7b9b11aad" alt="Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster" data-uuid="bd87987e-c5b9-3ff0-bde3-4660d3b7cf47"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien also spent some time with the new <a href="https://fave.co/323YExL">Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster</a>, which slashes $800 off the price of the previous model. For $1,200, you get a mahogany and spruce satin finish with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups and a three-way switch with six sound options. Instead of a rechargeable battery, the Player runs on a standard nine-volt cell. Terrence reports it eats through the batteries surprisingly quickly, but remains convenient.</p><p>When it came to how the instrument sounded, Terrence reports that while there are fewer acoustic simulations on this model, the two offerings (Rosewood Dreadnought and Mahogany Small Body) cover a lot of ground. He says that he prefers the electric sounds of the Telecaster to the more expensive <a href="https://fave.co/32arOvl">Jazzmaster</a>, as it resembles the original guitar more and plays better with pedals. Terrence says the two acoustic simulations offer depth and character, and that overall, the hybrid guitar is a perfect couch instrument.</p><h2>Universal’s Audio Volt is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-audio-volt-2-volt-276-review-audio-interface-home-studio-170050385.html">an audio interface ideal for a home studio</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/27d4b720-5f7f-11ec-bbef-3371e2aa6829" alt="Universal Audio Volt" data-uuid="a4a21376-8a82-3c72-ac4a-0969366eb12c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien deems Universal Audio’s first foray into the budget space a success. The company’s <a href="https://fave.co/3q3MTQt">Volt series</a>, five models that run from $139 to $369, are affordable audio interfaces that share a core 24-bit/192kHz audio converter and a preamp with a “Vintage” mode that aims to recreate that classic tube preamp sounds. Terrence tested the $189 Volt 2 and the $299 Volt 276, which are both two-input interfaces.</p><p>The differences between the two models are slight: the Volt 2 is simple and utilitarian, but works well with limited space, while the “76” version has a built-in compressor and will require extra desk space as most of the controls are on the top. Terrence says the compressor makes a big difference as it’s capable of softer edges to tame the harsher frequencies. He also felt the metering LEDs on the 276 were easier to see and the wooden sides were a nice touch. While the base models were excellent interfaces at reasonable prices, Terrence said the 176, 276 and 476 stood out from the pack thanks to their compressors, style and ergonomics.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-listen-to-yamahas-latest-headphones-with-3d-sound-170015087.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60360933-ebcd-452d-881b-41b2e81f5631</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 17:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639783892</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T23:31:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/054c3080-5f7e-11ec-bbcb-78afb82f2968" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/054c3080-5f7e-11ec-bbcb-78afb82f2968" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ICYMI: We listen to Yamaha’s latest headphones with 3D sound]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adidas' first NFT drop earns $23 million]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Adidas&#39; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adidas-metaverse-nft-teaser-173817023.html">first NFT effort</a> appears to have been a success. <em>The Block</em> has <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/128003/adidas-originals-nets-23-million-after-closing-its-first-nft-drop">learned</a> the collaboration with Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gmoney and Punks has raked in more than $23 million in Ethereum between a $15.5 million &quot;Early Access&quot; phase and $7.5 million in a general sale.

In the excerpt below, Rose takes a look at two companies leveraging computer vision and generative adversarial networks to reimagine existing properties as 21st century electrified smart homes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cfae0f40-59e0-11ec-9ddf-0394f646accf" alt="Supersight front cover" data-uuid="801f2f9c-a224-3d9f-8e5f-db9fb4165b6d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BenBella Books</div></figure><p><em>Excerpted with permission from </em><a href="https://www.supersight.world/">SuperSight: What Augmented Reality Means for Our Lives, Our Work, and the Way We Imagine the Future</a><em> by David Rose, published by BenBella Books.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>We should all be using solar panels. Period. The average cost for a sustainable energy system has fallen about 70% in the last decade, from $5.86/watt to $1.50/ watt, so it’s a financial no-brainer. For no money down, you can finance an installation and start saving a hundred dollars a month in the first month, and even more if you live in the sun-saturated South.</p><p>So why aren’t we? It’s complicated! Math, logistics, taxes, and aesthetics all play a role. Many homeowners fear it will make their houses shiny and reflective like the Tin Man from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. The process of figuring out the number of panels in what size you need requires learning to “talk solar” in unfamiliar units like kilowatt-hours. And change always comes with risk, whether actual or just perceived.</p><p>The pro-climate mission of Boston-based company Energy Sage is to get people to electrify their homes. That means solar panels on your roof, an electric car, a home battery system, automatic blinds, and a smart thermostat that precools or preheats as you drive home. And they’ve partnered with us at Continuum to get potential customers more comfortable with the idea by showing them what an electrified version of their home might look like. Using publicly available Google Home satellite images, we size solar panels, digitally overlay them on clients’ roofs, and then show them what their pad would look like from both the street and their neighbor’s fence. We then take those images and pair them with data from Project Sunroof, a Google project that helps you work out the solar savings potential of your roof. Once you’ve seen the beautiful pictures of your electrified home and realized how much you’re going to save over the years—and you have the visual and financial data in hand—it’s a simple decision to go forward and make that change.</p><p>Other home improvement projects will benefit from a similar SuperSight-envisioned approach. Let’s consider landscaping: another complicated, potentially expensive project with its own disorienting language, risks, and desperate need for pre-project visualization.</p><p>I met landscape designer Julie Moir-Messervy at an MIT pitch competition and was immediately intrigued with her mission: to give homeowners the confidence and tools they need to change their barren yard into a collection of outdoor living spaces. Her company, HomeOutside, helps people see new possibilities for their backyards using AI and computer vision. Once they’ve visualized their yard in a compelling way, the company makes it easy for them to make that vision a reality by hiring the landscape installer, getting materials delivered, and even helping spread the payments out over time.</p><p>Landscaping isn’t just good for property values; greenscapes filter airborne pollutants that trigger asthma, help people recuperate faster from illness, reduce summer temperatures, and even lower crime. Proper native landscaping powers a dynamic system that helps out the bees and birds, who in turn pollinate trees and reseed plants. Southwest shade trees can reduce the need for air-conditioning, and northeast hedges cut down on winter winds—and heating bills. More trees mean more carbon capture—a ton over the lifetime of each tree—as they literally suck the bad stuff we produce out of the air while reducing runoff and erosion.</p><p>But “most people don’t do anything in their yards because they don’t know where to start,” Julie told me. “They don’t know which plants to select and how to arrange them, or don’t know how to install a landscape design and care for it over time.” I was so inspired to work on the problem that I accepted a position on her board and got to work.</p><p>HomeOutside is training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to automatically compose beautiful and sustainable landscape designs, based on the thousands of designs (think of these as recipes) the firm has developed for clients over the last twenty-plus years. The company uses Google Earth Engine and photogrammetry to start with a 3D view of any address (US only, currently). The GAN architecture then uses one network (the Generator) to make a new design, and another network (the Discriminator) to judge or score the work. These two networks continue their iterative game, generating then scoring, until the discriminator judges that the landscape has a good composition: shade trees, natural pollinators, grass for playing, hardscapes/decks and furniture for gathering places, plant diversity, and so forth.</p><p>Companies that sell plants, furniture, lighting, and hardscapes are obviously interested in this type of “imagination engine” technology, because it bridges the conceptual gap between the current state of someone’s garden and what could be—thus motivating many more people to make the dream real. It’s not just great for the homeowners and outdoor retailers, either—it’s great for the environment, too. But what the company’s environmentally focused investors find  most captivating about this project is the opportunity to change the landscape of entire neighborhoods at scale. <em>What if we could create a new national park across millions of backyards that stitch together places for birds and bees? </em>Every acre of forest absorbs about 2.5 tons of carbon a year. What if we turned neighborhoods into significant carbon sequestration zones?</p><p>I helped Julie and her team develop HomeOutside’s grand plan to proactively redesign seventy million front yards, then work with Home Depot, Lowe’s, Wayfair, IKEA, and garden centers to email their customers a 3D redesign of their yard. Customers simply go outside their home, open their phone, and,through the app’s use of spatial world anchors, walk through an immersive animated landscape superimposed on their current yard. A time-lapse view from sunrise to sunset shows why the edible garden is placed where it is. The winter visualization explains the choice of new fir trees between their yard and the neighbor’s. Spring flowers bloom with a cacophony of color.</p><p>Will people be alarmed by the idea of an algorithm proactively redesigning their yard, with new shade trees and naturally pollinating shrubs? It’s not as if your front yard is private now, thanks to Google Street View. And if you are selling your home, you might decide against hiring the landscapers and just choose to post images of HomeOutside’s makeover version instead to maximize your curb appeal.</p><p>Once this visioning technology is commonplace, lots of different fields will start taking advantage of it. Home Depot, for example, recently invested in a startup called Hover, which, after digitizing your home in 3D, visualizes and prices new paint, siding, and roofing materials. SuperSight will soon show the actual paint crew up on their ladders, finishing the last few brush strokes, so you get that delightful experience of a job just finished. Volkswagen might put a new Passat in your driveway, complete with the kayaks and mountain bikes it knows you love on top. And the company trying to sell you home and car insurance? They’ll project a disaster scenario: solar panels fallen off, the shade tree hit by lightning, and your new Passat pummeled in a hail storm. Better buy the insurance before you repaint.</p><p>How will we interact with these types of immersive designs? With our SuperSight glasses on, will we point and place trees, or paint flowers from a palette of choices, like a 3D version of Photoshop? Will we select each plant from a vast menu of options for infinite control and customization, or will we just tell the system what we like so it learns our preferences, then proposes a single solution we’ll love? I believe in the happy medium: that we’ll largely prefer to see several “expertly composed” options and choose from among them, much as we do today when working with an architect, interior designer, or wedding planner.</p><p>Experts are usually so good at what they do that it’s often a mistake to over-specify particular details. For example, you shouldn’t tell an architect that you want a window exactly here, or an interior designer that you want this particular chair in a specific color in this corner. Instead, you express your opinions at a higher level of abstraction (“I want the room to feel more connected to the environment”) or through describing a required function (“We want a vegetable garden”), and let them do the detailed work.</p><p>The same expert-guided interaction model will dominate our relationships with SuperSight AIs. For landscaping, we might ask for a more formal French garden with rectilinear layouts and exotic colorful plants, or a curvaceous organic design that prioritizes privacy from our neighbors. We might indicate a preference for an open space for play, or for a filled-in scheme with more space for a productive garden. And as we express these higher-level interests, our 3D landscape design will dynamically recalculate to match our preferences. With SuperSight glasses on, we’ll be able to test our hunches faster by seeing reconfigurations immediately and in context, superimposed on our real home.</p><p>The jury is still out on whether HomeOutside will be able to use this technology to convince millions of homeowners to invest significantly in a sustainable landscape. The testing is promising, though; customers are delighted to see their yards reimagined and restaged. In the next five years, HomeOutside plans to use Google Earth and street view imagery in a generative AI tool to automatically redesign tens of millions of landscapes, with sustainable plants, shade trees, natural pollinators, and bird-friendly berries. If it succeeds, it will mean a million homeowners will plant at least 3 million new shade trees, like oaks and beeches, that will each capture 48 pounds of carbon a year as they mature. That’s 14 billion tons of carbon sequestered over those trees’ lifespans.</p><p>As one of the HomeOutside advisors summed up, “You are building the equivalent of a new national park—the National Park of us! Visualization tools like HomeOutside can persuade homeowners to reshape the American landscape.”</p><p>That’s the ultimate potential power of SuperSight: to help people envision and imagine a future that benefits themselves and the planet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-supersight-david-rose-ben-bella-books-163045081.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2e7cbadb-9440-4076-88a6-d797b95a8b56</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 16:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639166192</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T19:56:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Lawn & Garden]]></category><category><![CDATA[Home & Garden]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c42fd330-597f-11ec-a9bf-8d8073b32711" width="5000" height="3227" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c42fd330-597f-11ec-a9bf-8d8073b32711" width="5000" height="3227" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[sl-f via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Country house with solar panels on the roof and a terrace and swimming pool.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Modern house with solar panels on the roof and electric vehicle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NVIDIA's RTX 2050 laptop GPU slaps an old name on new technology]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NVIDIA is once again <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-revives-the-gtx-1050-ti-in-the-face-of-gpu-shortages-113533736.html">reviving an old name</a> in its graphics chip lineup, but this time it&#39;s for thoroughly modern technology. As <em>AnandTech</em><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17124/nvidia-announces-geforce-rtx-2050-mx570-and-mx550-for-laptops-2022s-entry-level-geforce">reports</a>, the company has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-laptop-new-options/">introduced</a> an GeForce RTX 2050 laptop GPU that may sound like recycled low-end hardware, but is based on the same Ampere design found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-ray-tracing-affordable-gaming-laptops-110058581.html">RTX 3050 series</a>. The naming scheme is confusing, to put it mildly, but that does give you up-to-date ray tracing in a potentially more affordable package.</p><p>You&#39;ll have to settle for a 64-bit memory bus instead of the 3050&#39;s 128-bit pipe, and the boost clock stops at 1,477MHz versus 1,740MHz. However, you&#39;ll still get the same 2,048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory, while peak power consumption drops to a much more reasonable 45W compared to the 80W of higher-end chips. This is partly meant for &#39;in-between&#39; laptops that don&#39;t have the chassis space or batteries for RTX 30 GPUs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has also revealed two entry-level chips, the MX550 and MX570, although it&#39;s shy on details beyond promises of more CUDA cores, faster memory and greater power efficiency than the MX450 they replace. The MX550 is based on the older Turing architecture, while the MX570 uses Ampere. Like with past MX chips, these are meant for thin-and-light portables where integrated graphics might not be good enough.</p><p>There&#39;s another issue beyond the branding: the release window. NVIDIA doesn&#39;t expect the RTX 2050 or new MX parts to reach shipping laptops until spring 2022. That&#39;s an usually long lead time, and suggests NVIDIA is announcing the GPUs now to clear the slate for CES in January.

As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/17/apple-releases-first-macos-12-2-beta-public-testers/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> notes, the OS comes with a new Music app that Apple had rebuilt as a full native application. Apple introduced macOS&#39; dedicated Music app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-apple-announces-separate-music-podcast-and-tv-apps-for-mac.html">back in 2019</a>, but it kept some iTunes elements for some parts of it, which means it still displays web content within the app.</p><p>Based on what <em>9to5Mac</em> has seen, macOS 12.2 beta uses AppKit, the framework needed to give applications a native interface. There won&#39;t be a big difference in looks, but the new app will apparently work faster. Searching for songs within Music, for instance, will appear more quickly because the results will be displayed on a native interface, while scrolling will feel smoother and trackpad gestures will feel more responsive.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to a brand new Music app, macOS 12.2 will also make scrolling in Safari smoother for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">14-and-16-inch MacBook Pro</a> models that support refresh rates of up to 120Hz. To test out macOS 12.2, you&#39;ll have to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/install-beta/">download and install</a> the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility. You&#39;ll then be able to access the latest beta update in the Software Update section of System Preferences.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-os-12-2-beta-public-134630683.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60fdd7a6-1382-4472-8d54-e6d29ab7f76b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 13:46:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639835193</ingested><modified>2021-12-18T13:46:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/35687d00-5ff1-11ec-bf6a-4b46920ab28e" width="4256" height="2832" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/35687d00-5ff1-11ec-bf6a-4b46920ab28e" width="4256" height="2832" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alberto Fava via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Recanati, Macerata, Italia - June 11, 2020: Brand new rose gold macbook air (2020) on a wooden table with the Apple logo highlighted in black, close up.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Brand new gold macbook air (2020) on a wooden table.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube TV loses access to ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has failed to strike a deal that would allow it to continue offering YouTube TV subscribers access to Disney&#39;s channels.

That’s according to screenshots shared this week by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-12-17/amazon-tornado-aftermath-workers-say-they-lacked-emergency-training"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> that document an exchange that reportedly happened last Friday shortly before a tornado hit an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, leading to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-tornado-edwardsville-illinois-deaths-climate-220437155.html"><ins>structural collapse and six deaths</ins></a>. “Just keep driving,” the dispatcher said in a message sent at 7:08PM that evening. “We can’t just call people back for a warning unless Amazon tells us to do so.”</p><p>After being told to “keep delivering” a second time about half an hour later, the driver said she wanted to turn back for her safety. “If you look at the radar, the worst of the storm is going to be right on top of me in 30 minutes.” To this, she was told she would lose her job if she drove back.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“If you decide to return with your packages, it will be viewed as you refusing your route, which will ultimately end with you not having a job come tomorrow morning,” the dispatcher said. “I’m literally stuck in this damn van without a safe place to go with a tornado on the ground,” the driver messaged back before being told to shelter in place.</p><p>In a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Amazon said the dispatcher didn’t follow safety guidelines. The company also said it’s investigating the incident and that the driver is safe. Here’s the full text of the statement it shared with the outlet:</p><blockquote><p>This was a developing situation across a broad geographic area, and unfortunately the delivery service partner’s dispatcher didn’t follow the standard safety practice. This dispatcher should have immediately directed the driver to seek shelter when the driver reported hearing tornado sirens. While this text exchange was going on, the local Amazon team was ensuring each delivery service partner had directed their drivers to shelter in place or seek shelter and advised them to stop delivering for the evening. We’re glad the driver is safe and we’re using the learnings from this incident to improve our policies and guidance for delivery service partners and drivers. Under no circumstance should the dispatcher have threatened the driver’s employment, and we’re investigating the full details of this incident and will take any necessary action.</p></blockquote><p>Amazon’s policies have led to several incidents where workers were expected to clock in even during extreme weather. In September, as tropical depression Ida caused widespread flooding throughout New York City, the retailer kept its warehouses open. In 2017, drivers told Engadget’s Bryan Menegus, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-last-mile-1820451224"><ins>then writing for </ins><em><ins>Gizmodo</ins></em></a>, they delivered packages in the immediate aftermath of hurricane Irma.

The software is called <a href="https://pages.adobe.com/shasta/"><ins>Project Shasta</ins></a>, and it could make recording and editing podcasts and other projects a lot easier and more approachable.</p><p>The project started off in Adobe Labs as an experiment to find  &quot;new ways to help people edit audio on the web,” Mark Webster, Adobe’s head of audio products, wrote in a post on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/project-shasta-from-adobe">Product Hunt</a>. “But then it became clear that the pandemic made recording difficult too, even for audio professionals. Our vision became empowering everyone with the tools they needed to create professional sounding audio.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The result is a browser-based tool — it requires Google Chrome — for creating and editing audio recordings in a visual interface without the need for professional equipment or other advanced tools.&nbsp;</p><p>Users record their audio in clips and Shasta automatically transcribes the recordings. From there, editing is as simple as deleting text from the transcription. There are also AI-based filters that can improve the audio quality or automatically remove filler words like “um.” Project Shasta also supports remote recording, so guest speakers can easily join in for recordings. The software will handle syncing up the clips even if one person has a shoddy internet connection.&nbsp;</p><div id="14a68d20a56340648a8146523529b918"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DTVbLxJwa0Y?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>While the most obvious use case for Shasta is recording podcasts, Webster notes it could also be used for voiceovers, videos and other projects with an audio component.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, it’s unclear exactly what Adobe has planned for Project Shasta. Webster said that the software is in an “early Alpha” stage, and that the company is sharing it now to get feedback from testers, but didn’t share when it might be available more widely. Project  Shasta is “free for now” to those who request access via Adobe&#39;s <a href="https://pages.adobe.com/shasta/request-invite">website</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobe-project-shasta-ai-audio-editing-220144426.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ab66964f-ed2b-4f40-a202-a4802bacef18</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 22:01:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639777976</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T21:53:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/49aa7740-5f7a-11ec-a79f-a5370f327d28" width="635" height="380" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/49aa7740-5f7a-11ec-a79f-a5370f327d28" width="635" height="380" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Adobe's Project Shasta audio editing software.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Adobe Project Shasta]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
