The treatment is meant for high-risk people 12 and older who could progress to a more serious COVID infection. The best part? The FDA says it could be available to use within a few days, making it another tool as we face the Omicron variant wave.</p><p>Paxlovid is available by prescription only, and it&#39;s meant to be taken within five days of first noticing COVID symptoms. According to Pfizer&#39;s tests, it can prevent hospitalization or death by 88 percent in high-risk patients. The treatment, which can be prescribed to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, consists of 30 pills taken over five days. It includes the protein inhibitor nirmatrelvir and rotinavir, which keeps that inhibitor from breaking down in your body. Side effects include an impaired sense of taste, high blood pressure, diarrhea and muscle aches.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“This authorization provides a new tool to combat COVID-19 at a crucial time in the pandemic as new variants emerge and promises to make antiviral treatment more accessible to patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19,&quot; Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.</p><p>So far, the US has ordered enough pills to treat 10 million people, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/pfizer-covid-pill-fda-paxlovid.html"><em>New York Times reports</em></a>. The company plans to deliver enough pills to cover 65,000 Americans within a week. And after that, production is expect to ramp up, with 150,000 courses delivered in January and 150,000 in February. It also won&#39;t be the only antiviral pill around: Merck&#39;s competing treatment is expected to be approved soon, and it&#39;ll likely be more readily available than Pfizer&#39;s. Merck&#39;s option is far less effective, though—tests show it can only prevent hospitalization or death by 30 percent. (Still, that&#39;s better than having no treatment.)&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fda-pfizer-covid-antiviral-pill-paxlovid-205104688.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e6bb1c3-81af-4cab-8891-b85e6b9d360b</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 20:51:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640206292</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T20:51:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pharmaceuticals & Drug Trials]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e52aa760-6364-11ec-9f5d-7df1ad02bf38" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e52aa760-6364-11ec-9f5d-7df1ad02bf38" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HANDOUT / AFP]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[(FILES) This file handout photo provided to AFP on November 16, 2021 courtesy of Pfizer shows the making of its experimental Covid-19 antiviral pills, Paxlovid, inside his laboratory in Freiburg, Germany.

A message told Thea-Mai Baumann she was suspended for impersonation, though she had never pretended to be anyone else. Her account was returned after <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/technology/instagram-handle-metaverse.html"><ins>wrote a story</ins></a> about the ordeal, but the company never offered an explanation for how the mistake was made.</p><p>While what happened to her was unusual, one aspect of Baumann’s story is more common: that people who are wrongfully suspended from their social media accounts often have little or no recourse for getting them back (at least, not without media attention).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now that group may have another option. The “robot lawyer” company DoNotPay, which offers automated legal services, has a new offering: getting social media accounts <a href="https://donotpay.com/learn/how-to-get-unbanned"><ins>unbanned</ins></a>.</p><p>The new service, which is included with DoNotPay’s $36 monthly subscription, offers users an alternative to emailing companies’ help center bots or wiring appeals that may never get answered. Instead, DoNotPay asks users for information about what happened to them, and sends a letter to the relevant company’s legal department on their behalf.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/473f6200-635c-11ec-acff-b2dcfeb03dbc" style="height:377;width:595;" alt="the service can help get banned accounts back online." data-uuid="5314bfe9-870d-303d-a44b-7cdba77ad809"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DoNotPay</div></figure><p>“These platforms prioritize legal cases,” DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder tells Engadget. “When you&#39;re just writing into customer service, they don&#39;t really take it seriously.” Legal departments, on the other hand, are much more likely to respond, he says.</p><p>In the appeal, the company also tries to “match” your appeal with a “legal reason why they can&#39;t ban you,” using state and federal laws that may apply. The letter also includes a deadline for the company to respond. He says that so far PayPal and Instagram have been among the most-requested services for unbanning. But the service will work with other platforms as well, including Twitter, Snapchat, Uber, Tinder, YouTube, Twitch and others.</p><p>Crucially, Browder points out that the service is not intended for people who were banned from a platform for legitimate reasons, like violating its terms of service. And even for those who were wrongly suspended, he estimates the odds of actually getting an account back as the result of this process are around 20 percent.</p><p>But even if the appeal isn’t ultimately successful, Browder says there are other benefits to the process. For one, companies are required to turn over users’ data regardless of whether their account was suspended. So even if you are unable to, say, regain access to your Instagram account, DoNotPay can ensure the company hands over your account details. There’s also the fact that sending a legal demand letter can cause a much bigger headache for a company than ranting to customer service agents.</p><p>“In general in America, they do have the right to ban you,” Browder says. “We don&#39;t overstate that we can make miracles happen, but we can punish them a lot and get your data.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/do-not-pay-unban-social-media-194515590.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">549ed055-6b96-43f6-b3b5-63b3467f2640</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 19:45:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640202035</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T19:40:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c87ce760-635d-11ec-bdff-58a453a284bd" width="6664" height="4419" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c87ce760-635d-11ec-bdff-58a453a284bd" width="6664" height="4419" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[pressureUA via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kyiv, Ukraine - September 10, 2019: A paper cubes collection with printed logos of well-known social networks and online messengers, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and others.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[A Wall of Cubes with Social Media Apps]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Steam's Winter Sale offers discounts on 'Horizon Zero Dawn,' 'Deathloop' and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Steam’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Winter Sale is now underway</a>.

Citing documents and testimony <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">shared by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>, they say they want to know why the company &quot;prematurely&quot; removed safeguards it had in place before the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>&quot;This action allowed misinformation, disinformation, and violent rhetoric to return to the platform immediately following Election Day and in the lead-up to the January 6th insurrection,&quot; the group said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Many of the questions center around Meta&#39;s defunct Civic Integrity team. During her testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Data Security, Haugen said that the company dissolved shortly after the 2020 election. That&#39;s a claim Meta has consistently disputed.</p><p>&quot;We did not disband Civic Integrity,&quot; Guy Rosen, Meta vice president for integrity, told <a href="https://time.com/6104899/facebook-reckoning-frances-haugen/"><em>Time</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>in October. &quot;We integrated it into a larger Central Integrity team so that the incredible work pioneered for elections could be applied even further, for example, across health-related issues. Their work continues to this day.&quot;</p><p>To that point, the group asks Zuckerberg when Meta made the decision to disband the team and who ultimately made it. They also want to know what part of Meta is currently responsible for overseeing its efforts to prevent election-related misinformation, in addition to details like how many employees the company has assigned to that division. Beyond those questions, the group says they want to know how Meta plans to protect the integrity of future elections.</p><p>&quot;While we acknowledge the efforts Facebook took to prevent the spread of election-related misinformation and disinformation, violent rhetoric, and harassment prior to the 2020 elections, it clearly was not enough to prevent lies about the election from taking root on the platform and fueling violence against our democracy,&quot; Klobuchar, Reed and the 11 other senators said.</p><p>The group stops short of threatening regulatory action against Meta. It&#39;s possible the Senate could call on Zuckerberg to testify much like Instagram head <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-instagram-adam-mosseri-001751448.html">Adam Mosseri</a> was asked to do earlier this month. While most US lawmakers agree more needs to be done to regulate Facebook and other social media platforms, Democrats and Republicans have found little common ground on how to approach the issue.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senate-letter-to-mark-zuckerberg-meta-election-misinformation-171719009.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7eafd5d9-0384-4813-a8cc-76a9086587f8</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 17:17:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640193769</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T17:22:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/af8f7b10-31cf-11ec-bc7c-7fea7bbc8790" width="968" height="546" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/af8f7b10-31cf-11ec-bc7c-7fea7bbc8790" width="968" height="546" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Handout . / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies during a remote video hearing held by subcommittees of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee on "Social Media's Role in Promoting Extremism and Misinformation" in Washington, U.S., March 25, 2021.

The electric vehicle manufacturer notched records for both deliveries and profits this year despite a global <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sales-continue-to-surge-in-the-face-of-chip-shortages-190311024.html">chip shortage</a> that decimated supply chains worldwide, effectively kneecapping the rest of the automotive industry’s production capacity. However its financial successes were often overshadowed by Tesla’s continuing production quality issues, multiple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">NHTSA</a> and <a href="http://v/">SEC</a> investigations, high profile failures of its vaunted “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-price-availability-151630041.html">Full Self Driving</a>” system, as well as numerous vehicle recalls and delays for upcoming models. And with existing industry stalwarts like Ford, GM, Honda and the Volkswagen Group making concerted efforts to electrify their own offerings, could 2022 be the year that Tesla’s reign as top EV automaker finally ends?</p><h2>The Good</h2><p>2021 was, without a doubt, a banner year for Tesla’s bottom line. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-2020-production-half-million-cars-154826010.html">entered this year</a> having met its 2020 goal of producing a half-million vehicles (of which it delivered 499,550 to customers), a nearly 133,000 unit increase over 2019. By April, Tesla had produced a record 180,338 vehicles and delivered 184,800 of them. Demand remained strong throughout the first half of the year thanks, in part, to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cuts-entry-level-model-3-y-prices-151853489.html">price cuts on both the Model 3 and Model Y</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company then <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sets-delivery-record-by-building-and-shipping-200000-vehicles-in-q-2-213045738.html">broke its same record</a> in July, having built 200,000 vehicles over the past three months, earning Tesla $1.1 billion in net income during the same period. “Public sentiment towards EVs is at an inflexion point and, at this point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward,” Musk said during the Q2 earnings call.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Tesla’s record-breaking trend <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-posts-a-wildly-profitable-q3-despite-difficult-car-market-210905631.html">continued unabated through Q3</a> with the company rolling 237,823 vehicles off its production lines — nearly all of which were of the Model 3 and Model Y varieties — and delivering 241,300 of them. The company also began taking pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-y-pre-orders-uk-delivery-date-192222135.html">UK version of the Model Y in October</a> and announced that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-y-amd-ryzen-china-174802550.html">those Model Ys destined for the Chinese market</a> would be receiving upgraded AMD Ryzen chipsets.</p><p>Tesla capped off its stellar financial year with announcements from Hertz that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html">it plans to order 100,000 vehicles</a> (though there <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hertz-hasnt-ordered-100000-tesla-e-vs-yet-103529013.html">remains uncertainty about how that deal will actually play out</a>) and from Uber Eats that it intends to rent as many as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-rents-tesla-evs-to-drivers-131556170.html">50,000 Tesla vehicles to its drivers</a>.</p><h2>The Bad</h2><p>While Tesla enjoyed unabashed sales success with its core lineup, the company often struggled to meet release deadlines for a number of its yet-to-be-released models. Both the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-delay-2022-150309858.html">Cybertruck</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delays-semi-truck-2022-102502178.html">Semi</a> have both been pushed back to 2022 while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-roadster-delay-2023-202010781.html">the Tesla Roadster reportedly won’t be arriving</a> until <em>at least</em> 2023. Tesla also took the strange tack of releasing an “entry-level” standard range Model Y for just a few weeks <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-stops-taking-model-y-standard-range-orders-192226812.html">before discontinuing the trim level</a>. Similarly, Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-delivery-date-152029394.html">pushed back the release</a> of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-first-deliveries-075110301.html">$130,000 Model S Plaid edition</a> to June 10th, debuting it mere days after Musk unilaterally announced that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-tesla-model-s-plaid-plus-canceled-211804141.html">the Model S Plaid+ was canceled outright</a>,</p><p>The company was also beset by a wide array of production woes and vehicle recalls this year. In February, Tesla bowed to pressure from the NHTSA and recalled 135,000 Model X and S vehicles on account of faulty touchscreens. That same month, Tesla was forced to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-x-recall-germany-kba-160928114.html&#39;">issue a recall for another 12,300 Model Xs</a> on account of loose trim panels. In April, customers reported that the company had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telsa-customers-double-charged-for-cars-082515018.html">double-charged them for their vehicles</a>, up to $71,000 in some cases, though <a href="http://v/">Tesla was quick to reimburse the affected buyers</a> and even threw in a $200 gift certificate for the company store.</p><p>June saw yet another recall, this time for 6,000 Model 3 and Ys over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-recalls-loose-bolts-model-3-y-140841331.html">faulty brake caliper bolts</a>, and in October, Tesla had to recall another set of Ys and 3s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-recall-suspension-model-y-3-191031712.html">because their suspensions kept separating</a>. Just last month, the company had to pull nearly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-braking-recall-software-glitch-132442476.html">12,000 vehicles from across its product line</a> on account of software issues — that’s not to be confused with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-app-outage-locked-owners-out-025004678.html">the recent Tesla App outage</a> that locked drivers around the world out of their own vehicles.</p><p>Tesla’s parade of crises also extended to the production lines themselves with the Fremont factory facing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fremont-factory-covid-19-cases-200515835.html">a sizeable COVID outbreak shortly after reopening in March</a>.

Following its debut in October of last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-expansion-8-3-171559184.html">beta 8.3 rolled out in May</a>, doubling the size of the test program, before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-v9-beta-release-date-170921380.html">releasing beta 9 in July</a>. Version 9’s rollout coincided with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-price-availability-151630041.html">new FSD subscription program</a> charging customers $199 a month (or $99 a month if they’d previously purchased the now-discontinued Enhanced Autopilot feature) — assuming they already had the $1,500 FSD computer hardware installed in their vehicle.</p><p>However, Tesla’s decision to abandon radar-based autonomation sensors <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-vision-autopilot-230045425.html">in favor of an optical-only setup in May</a> led to a backlash from the NHTSA which subsequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-safety-tesla-080857344.html">forced the company to remove some of its driver-assist designations</a> such as forward collision and lane departure warnings. In an effort to counter claims that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-using-autopilot-study-finds-072247148.html">use of the Autopilot feature can cause drivers to become inattentive</a> and less responsive once they resume control of the vehicle, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-in-car-camera-autopilot-081511875.html">Tesla activated its in-car driver monitoring cameras</a> in late May.</p><div id="362867a9ef944dea9706df41ed9b7b51"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Qxi8OhCmOI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">FSD beta 10 arrived to great fanfare in September</a> with owners noting smoother turns on city streets, improved display visuals and an overall improvement in the vehicle’s off-highway navigation. Those feelings were short-lived when, in October, the company was forced to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-pulls-latest-self-driving-beta-over-left-turn-and-other-issues-063331006.html">revert its beta 10.3 implementation</a> after becoming aware of &quot;some issues,&quot; per Musk, including a &quot;regression&quot; with left turns.

In April, China banned Tesla vehicles from its military bases and “key state-owned companies” over fears that the cars’ myriad cameras <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-military-bans-tesla-cars-162136546.html">could be leveraged for espionage</a>. After nearly a month of wrangling and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-chinese-social-media-spying-fears-131002911.html">appeals to social media</a>, Tesla finally caved to China’s cybersecurity demands and established a local clearinghouse for that data.</p><h2>The Musk</h2><p>And what would a Year in Review of Tesla be without a look back at CEO Elon Musk’s unique brand of shenanigans? <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-elon-musk-twitter-complaints-support-staff-185047267.html">Last October</a>, Musk unilaterally disbanded Tesla’s PR department, thereby making his personal Twitter account the first, last and only stop for confirmation of the company’s decisions. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-elon-musk-twitter-complaints-support-staff-185047267.html">This January</a>, Musk reversed course slightly and, instead of reforming the department, began hiring people to respond to customer complaints made toward him on the social media platform.</p><p>Speaking of tweets, Tesla was also sued this year for allegedly breaking a previously struck deal with the SEC by allowing Musk to continue sending <a href="http://v/">unapproved, &quot;erratic&quot; tweets</a> as well as for the company failing to obtain a neutral general counsel to reign in its CEO. The National Labor Relations Board also went after Tesla in 2021, finding that the company had illegally fired a union activist. The NLRB consequently demanded that the worker be rehired and Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-ordered-to-delete-tweet-from-2018-111132733.html">delete a 2018 union-busting tweet</a> related to the case.</p><p>2021 was also the year that Musk leaned hard into crypto. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-to-take-bitcoin-payments-140109988.html">Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of the stuff in February</a> and briefly toyed with the idea of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-will-soon-let-you-buy-one-of-its-e-vs-with-bitcoin-082916783.html">allowing customers to use the currency to purchase its vehicles</a>, though those plans were quickly canned over concerns about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-bitcoin-221708146.html">Bitcoin mining’s environmental impacts</a>. Musk also took time out of his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-to-host-saturday-night-live-202950558.html">Saturday Night Live hosting duties</a> in May to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-snl-host-dogecoin-171627334.html">crash the value of Bitcoin rival Dogecoin</a>, though his later tweets helped <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doge-musk-233459058.html">the price of Dogecoin rebound</a>, to a degree.</p><p>And then there was the whole Tesla “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-bot-humanoid-robot-033635103.html">Robot</a>” debacle, which I can’t even, I mean, it was literally just an actor in a spandex jumpsuit dancing around while Musk made a bunch of wildly unsubstantiated claims.</p><h2>What’s Next</h2><p>Looking ahead to 2022, Tesla appears to be on track for continued success. Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-berlin-gigafactory-production-start-date-145218970.html">Berlin Gigafactory is nearly ready to start production</a> and is expected to do so by the end of this month – barring any unforeseen setbacks. The company’s stockpile of chipsets and <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/544742/tesla-battery-supply-deal-ganfeng/">aggressive maneuvers to shore up supplies</a> of battery precursor materials will insulate Tesla from many of the production bottlenecks that many other EV automakers are likely to struggle with throughout the new year.</p><p>However, even with Tesla’s record-breaking production figures from the past couple of years, the number of vehicles it delivers annually is still a small fraction of what more established automakers sell. BMW, for example, sold 2.3 million vehicles worldwide in 2020. In the same year, GM sold 2.5 million in the US <em>alone</em>. And as those companies increasingly turn their attention to the EV market while leveraging economies of scale that Tesla cannot match, Musk’s company could soon find itself relegated back to being a niche EV brand rather than an industry titan.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-had-a-phenomenal-2021-150044600.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">710f01f2-bd38-43d2-83ac-d544b04df53b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640171994</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T11:20:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6894ac80-56eb-11ec-b7df-457f6f710563" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6894ac80-56eb-11ec-b7df-457f6f710563" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Raindrops are seen on the logo of Tesla car in Milan, Italy on November 25, 2021.

Once in operation, it&#39;s one of iRobot&#39;s quietest vacuums yet thanks to a change in the placement of the motor. On top of that, it supposedly has twice the suction power as the Roomba 960.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It does a great job of avoiding obstacles and cleaning efficiently, thanks to the smart mapping feature that can create an entire plan of your house. You can then label each area and ask it to only clean specific rooms. It&#39;s ideal if you have pets, as the multi-surface robber brushes supposedly won&#39;t tangle up with pet hair.

It also has longer battery life and AI-powered vision that can detect pet waste and other nasty stuff.

But <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Arcane" href="https://fave.co/3dubJmE"><em>Arcane</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>surprised me with its well-written characters, wonderfully realized fantasy world and luscious animation. While there are some killer action sequences, what really makes <em>Arcane </em>work is its commitment to mature storytelling. Characters you love will die. Villains are never one-note and heroes are never perfect. It&#39;s not only a solid video game adaptation, it&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html">one of the best TV shows to debut this year</a>.</p><h3>Midnight Mass</h3><div id="728eb65df3174ce292df9401be3d48ce"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y-XIRcjf3l4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Religious-focused horror may seem more like anti-holiday programming, but that&#39;s not going to stop us from recommending <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Midnight Mass" href="https://fave.co/3y5k49T"><em>Midnight Mass</em></a>. The show is an exploration of dogma, fanaticism, our connection to the cosmos and another compelling series from the rising horror master Mike Flanagan. Unlike his previous haunted house entries (<em>The Haunting of Hill House </em>and <em>Bly Manor</em>), <em>Midnight Mass</em> focuses on a small island community off the coast of Massachusetts, the sort of place that has its own demons festering under the surface.

Realme, the sister brand of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n-foldable-phone-china-101211924.html">Oppo</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-launches-a-pac-man-addition-of-its-nord-2-smartphone-132509111.html">OnePlus</a>, announced that its upcoming flagship <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/realme-gt-2-pro-paper-tech-master-design-naoto-fukasawa-130035106.html">GT 2 Pro</a> features an eco-friendly bio-polymer material on its back cover — apparently a first in the mobile industry. Better yet, Realme has once <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-15-realme-x-garlic-onion-master-edition-naoto-fukasawa.html">again</a> collaborated with Muji and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-19-kddi-infobar-a03-smartphone.html">Infobar</a> series design icon Naoto Fukasawa, who finished the GT 2 Pro&#39;s design with a textured paper feel on the body. They call this &quot;Paper Tech Master Design.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3fe9a080-6328-11ec-bcae-41e9a7555837" alt="Realme GT 2 Pro" data-uuid="d4acb47a-93be-32d3-aa48-c0241b6556e3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>This bio-polymer material, supplied by Saudi Arabia&#39;s SABIC, is based on paper pulp, and it has obtained International Sustainability and Carbon Certification (or ISCC in short) to prove its environmental friendliness. The Realme GT 2 Pro&#39;s packaging also uses much less plastic than its predecessor — from an overall plastic ratio of 21.7 percent down to a mere 0.3 percent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The phone itself packs some surprises, too. For one, it&#39;s one of the first devices to be powered by Qualcomm&#39;s latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset, following the <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/motorola-moto-edge-x30-edge-s30-132744690.html">Moto Edge X30</a>. The GT 2 Pro is also the world&#39;s first smartphone with a 150-degree ultra-wide camera (most are at around 120 degrees), which offers a unique fisheye camera mode for some fun photography.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also some noteworthy features on the radio side. In Realme&#39;s &quot;Antenna Array Matrix System&quot; here, there&#39;s the &quot;world&#39;s first&quot; ultra-wide-band antenna switching technology, which lets the phone switch to whichever of the 12 antennas has the best signal strength. In addition, this system consists of a symmetrical Wi-Fi antenna which apparently boosts signal stability by up to 20 percent.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7ff0f6f0-6329-11ec-97ef-9b6f0d2f4049" alt="NFC 3 antenna array" data-uuid="62bb92c6-0154-382a-9448-130c4a8dec15"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Realme</div></figure><p>But the most interesting feature here is perhaps the &quot;360-degree NFC,&quot; which is achieved by hooking up the NFC module to the top two cellular antennas as well as its own, thus forming an &quot;NFC 3 antenna array.&quot; This allows the upper part of the GT 2 Pro to read NFC on either side, which should make the likes of contactless payment and Bluetooth pairing easier.</p><p>For now, the Realme GT 2 Pro is only slated for a China launch at 7:30PM local time (6:30AM ET) on January 4th, 2022, but a company spokesperson confirmed that it will eventually go overseas. Given the brand&#39;s track record, this device will likely be competitively priced, but we&#39;re just eager to check out Fukasawa&#39;s latest mobile design in person — especially the supposedly paper-like texture. Stay tuned for more technical specs, prices and our hands-on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/realme-gt-2-pro-sustainability-naoto-fukasawa-135537116.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ae42172-a8b6-4f1d-b6a2-dfec9949b045</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 13:55:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640180702</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T13:45:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a865e680-631b-11ec-abbf-092668b9f3f3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a865e680-631b-11ec-abbf-092668b9f3f3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Realme]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Realme GT 2 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Realme GT 2 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA delays James Webb telescope launch due to poor weather]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The James Webb Space Telescope is finally ready for launch after 14 years in development. NASA cleared its launch readiness review and gave it the go-ahead for launch, which was supposed to take place on December 24th. Unfortunately, poor weather conditions have <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/21/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-update/">prompted</a> the agency to delay its launch yet again. James Webb will be lifting off from Europe&#39;s Spaceport in French Guiana on an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket with the new target date of December 25th and a launch window of between 7:20 AM and 7:52 AM Eastern time.</p><p>This is the closest the telescope has ever gotten to starting its month-long journey towards its destination. It&#39;s been delayed numerous times in the past due to one reason or another — NASA targeted an October launch date after its development was delayed by the pandemic, but it determined that the telescope wouldn&#39;t be ready until November or December.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NASA (and its partners, the European and Canadian space agencies) then targeted a December 18th launch date, before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-215323872.html">pushing it back</a> to December 22nd. The James Webb team needed the extra time to inspect the telescope and make sure nothing was damaged during an incident that happened at testing. Its launch was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-telescope-launch-delayed-again-december-24th-111052456.html">delayed</a> to December 24th after that because of a communication issue between the telescope and its Ariane 5 launch vehicle. This time, NASA had already conducted a news conference confirming that the telescope is ready for launch before announcing the new target date.</p><p>After the James Webb telescope arrives in its orbit near the second Lagrange point of the Earth-Sun system, researchers around the world will be able to use it to peer at some of the universe&#39;s earliest galaxies, look into black holes and assess exoplanets&#39; habitability. NASA will confirm the new launch date this evening.</p><div id="02df22879b8d4f6b843ff6b7b2313a68"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Due to adverse weather conditions at Europe’s Spaceport in French Guiana, the James Webb Space Telescope’s launch is postponed from Dec. 24 to no earlier than Dec. 25.

Following the recent boom in NFT success stories (and millions being made), we have the other side of the coin. Ubisoft’s attempts to sell NFTs tied to its Ghost Recon gaming series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-nft-quartz-ghost-recon-blockchain-140720063.html"><ins>haven’t gone well</ins></a>. The games company  launched its own Quartz NFT platform to monetize game properties.</p><p>Alas, it seems Quartz has sold just 15 NFTs of a <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint </em>gun skin as of yesterday, according to <em>Eurogamer</em>. As of yesterday, it appears to have sold two more M4A1 tactical weapons and one Wolf Enhance Pants #76 for a total of 18. According to their prices, that works out to about $1,755.30 in revenue. But Ubisoft appears to have minted about somewhere north of 3,000 NFTs, total. As many have noted, <em>Breakpoint</em> doesn&#39;t have the most alluring visual aesthetic — nor is it the biggest Ubisoft property — making it an odd choice to kick off Ubisoft’s NFT attempts.</p><p>In other news, CES is facing the Omicron threat, and many companies are withdrawing from exhibiting early January. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-meta-t-mobile-drop-out-of-ces-2022-085845578.html"><ins>Amazon, Meta and several other big tech players</ins></a> will no longer have a presence at the show, citing the spread of the latest COVID-19 variant.

And, no, we don’t mean Chrome. As of today, the privacy-focused Vivaldi browser is available on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html"><ins>Polestar 2 vehicles</ins></a>. It’s a first for Android Automotive and the company, which had yet to offer its software on vehicles before today.</p><p>Vivaldi says safety was one of its top priorities when porting the browser over to Android Automotive. To that end, it’s only possible to start a session when your car is parked. If you start streaming something and then resume driving, Vivaldi will limit the video to audio-only.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, privacy was also a priority for the team. The browser won’t store your browsing data on the car whenever you open a private tab. If you want to transfer your data between devices, you can do so by signing into your Vivaldi account. That information is something the company says Polestar won’t be able to access.</p><p>The Android Automotive version of Vivaldi is based on the company’s mobile release. You won’t find some functionality that is available in the desktop version – for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivaldi-accordion-tab-stacks-070000491.html"><ins>accordion tabs</ins></a> are missing – and Vivaldi has disabled a handful of other features. It’s not possible to download files and scan QR codes, for example. Otherwise, there aren’t many differences between the Android Automotive release and other versions of Vivaldi, and the company says updates will come at a regular cadence.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vivaldi-android-automotive-polestar-2-120011646.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3234f11c-cad0-44d3-a829-b98b045fff58</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 12:00:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639687188</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T20:40:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/11e2d990-5eaf-11ec-bcb9-48a8163c6ed7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/11e2d990-5eaf-11ec-bcb9-48a8163c6ed7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vivaldi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Vivaldi Polestar 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Vivaldi Polestar 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[RadioShack is building a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>RadioShack — yes, <em>that</em> RadioShack that used to sell electronic goods — is now a crypto business. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-02-05-radioshack-files-for-bankruptcy-as-sprint-eyes-its-stores.html">filed</a> for bankruptcy back in 2015 after 11 unprofitable quarters in a row, bringing it&#39;s almost 100-year history to an end. After that, the former retail chain&#39;s branding rights were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-05-13-radioshack-brand-sold.html">sold</a> several times until they were acquired by Retail Ecommerce Ventures Review (REV). If you visit <a href="https://www.radioshack.com/?sscid=c1k5_opb4u&amp;">RadioShack&#39;s website</a> right now, you&#39;ll see a banner talking about its new mission to bring cryptocurrency to the mainstream. You&#39;ll also see a sign up section to be notified as soon as its RADIO token launches.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/crypto/radioshack-is-getting-into-the-crypto-business/"><em>CNET</em></a> and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/radioshack-turns-to-crypto-with-radio-tokens"><em>Tom&#39;s Hardware</em></a> explain, RadioShack is building a Decentralized Finance ecosystem in partnership with the Atlas USV (Universal Store of Value) protocol. Atlas was designed by Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, who are also the duo behind REV. RadioShack&#39;s DeFi ecosystem will start with a decentralized exchange, which the company describes as the &quot;lowest hanging fruit that is full of opportunities&quot; on its website. When it&#39;s up, the DeFi exchange will allow users to send cryptocurrency directly to each other rather than through an exchange service like Coinbase.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Based on what&#39;s written on RadioShack&#39;s website, REV is hoping that the &quot;100-year-old brand&quot; is embedded enough &quot;into the global consciousness&quot; to encourage widespread crypto adoption. It&#39;s even hoping that RadioShack could become the gateway for large corporations like Starbucks and Louis Vuitton to becoming blockchain companies. It&#39;s a lofty goal, especially for a brand that declared bankruptcy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-30-lawsuit-sprint-caused-radioshack-bankruptcy.html">twice</a> within the span of a few years.

Amazon, Meta, Twitter and T-Mobile have announced that they&#39;re no longer attending the event in person due to the threat brought about by the COVID-19 Omicron variant. The show earlier this year was a strictly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2021-what-to-expect-210017996.html">online-only affair</a>, but the Consumer Technology Association announced in April that the event is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2022-in-person-las-vegas-143003027.html">returning</a> as an in-person affair in 2022. While the organizer requires attendees to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ces-2022-proof-of-vaccination-requirement-151808496.html">show proof</a> of vaccination to be able to attend the expo, the Omicron variant&#39;s emergence prompted companies to reconsider their plans.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-21/meta-twitter-scrap-plans-for-ces-in-las-vegas-after-covid-surge?sref=WJKVI5nK"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> in a statement that it&#39;ll no longer have an on-site presence at the event &quot;due to the quickly shifting situation and uncertainty around the Omicron variant.&quot; Its smart home subsidiary Ring will no longer be attending, as well. Meanwhile, Facebook parent company Meta said it won&#39;t be attending the expo in person anymore &quot;due to the evolving public health concerns related to COVID-19.&quot; A spokesperson told <em>Engadget</em> that it will &quot;participate virtually as much as possible and continue to collaborate with the CTA around CES, which remains an important event for Meta, its clients and industry partners.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Similarly, Twitter has canceled its in-person appearance &quot;due to the spike in Covid cases across the country in the past week.&quot; It&#39;s reportedly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-will-not-attend-ces-person-over-covid-19-concerns-2021-12-21/">exploring</a> ways to be able to participate virtually, as well. Even CES sponsor T-Mobile has chosen to step back and <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/business/t-mobile-announcement-about-ces-2022">limit</a> its on-site participation. &quot;While we are confident that CES organizers are taking exhaustive measures to protect in-person attendees and we had many preventative practices in place as well, we are prioritizing the safety of our team and other attendees with this decision,&quot; it said in a statement. Other companies that have chosen to cancel include <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/internet/news/ces-2022-covid-19-omicron-cancel-facebook-meta-twitter-pinterest-drop-plans-2664407">Pinterest</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/ces-2022-tmobile-amazon-iheartradio-cancel-covid-1235141979/">iHeartRadio</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s still a lot of unknown factors surrounding the Omicron variant, but researchers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/omicron-coronavirus-variant.html">have found</a> it to be a highly transmissible strain. Further, what they&#39;ve discovered suggests that most non-mRNA vaccines (such as Sinovac and Sinopharm) offer almost no protection against the variant. At the moment, though, the CTA has yet to announce any changes to the event, and the in—person expo is still scheduled to take place in January.</p><p><strong>Update 12/22/21 11:20AM ET:</strong> Updated the post with a statement from Meta about its plans to participate virtually.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-meta-t-mobile-drop-out-of-ces-2022-085845578.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8e863d83-4663-4ffe-b9dd-19de39349a78</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 08:58:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640190279</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T16:24:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9ed8b0f0-62fa-11ec-9edf-7e201090f728" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9ed8b0f0-62fa-11ec-9edf-7e201090f728" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/01/20: In this photo illustration, a hand of a person holds a smartphone with a Consumer Electronics Show (CES) logo displayed in the background.

The company&#39;s new DualUp Monitor has an unusual 16:18 aspect ratio. It&#39;s a vertical display with a 2,560 x 2,880-pixel resolution that LG is calling &quot;Square Double QHD.&quot; When you use its vertical split view function, the DualUp looks like you put two 21.5—inch monitors on top of each other.&nbsp;</p><p>It could be a better form factor than the typical monitor if you&#39;re constantly having to look at information on multiple windows or screens for work or for any other reason. In its announcement, LG says the model will help reduce side-to-side head movements that cause neck pain. DualUp was also meant to save space and will ship with the LG Ergo stand that clamps to most desks and tables. The Nano IPS monitor&#39;s other features include a brightness of 300 nits, a 1000:1 contrast ratio and HDR10 support.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to DualUp, LG has also introduced the UltraFine, a 32-inch 4K UHD monitor. It has a more conventional aspect ratio, but it is the first to use LG&#39;s Nano IPS Black panel technology, which enables a contrast ratio of 2,000:1. The company will reveal more about both premium monitors at its virtual press event on January 4th. It&#39;s unknown at this point whether LG will still push through with a physical experience at CES 2022, assuming the event will still take place despite the threat posed by the Omicron variant. It was planning on showcasing a list of new items during the conference aside from these monitors, though, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-soundbar-s95qr-ces-2022-073941883.html">soundbar</a> with a center up-firing speaker, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/l-gs-stanbyme-wireless-tv-101519278.html">wireless TV on wheels</a> and an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-design-focused-oled-tv-moving-cover-131546091.html">OLED TV with a motorized cover</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-dualup-monitor-051303157.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b44c61f8-811b-41df-90f8-324bbfc46e46</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 05:13:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640149986</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T05:13:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1dbfdb50-62dd-11ec-bedf-0ca9fc69d41a" width="1178" height="661" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1dbfdb50-62dd-11ec-bedf-0ca9fc69d41a" width="1178" height="661" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG Electronics USA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Both the LG UltraFineâ¢ Display (model 32UQ85R) and LG DualUp Monitor (model 28MQ780) offer sleek and practical designs, enhanced connectivity and superior user experience for both home and office workers, including creative professionals and programmers.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG-DualUp-Lifestyle-00]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Voice now lets you decide who goes to voicemail]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google now lets you customize how its Voice service <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/12/set-custom-rules-for-incoming-google-voice-calls.html">handles incoming calls</a>.
