At the time, the company promised it would have more to say about the subject, and now it has. On late Monday evening, the company took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/qb1ayt/darkplates_are_back_checkmate_lawyers/">Reddit</a> to announce a second version of the faceplates it says Sony won&#39;t have a legal case against.</p><p>“By creating a brand new design, Darkplates 2.0 successfully closes the loop on this dispute and neutralizes any future infringement claims from Sony,” the company said. It also claims its plates will make your PS5 look “considerably less ugly.” You can be the judge of that last one.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to a new design, the panels feature cutouts for the PS5’s 120mm intake fans. Citing data from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmggkW6usmQ">Gamers Nexus</a>, Dbrand claims its new plates will maximize your PS5’s thermal performance without the need to run it naked. Sony’s latest console doesn’t have overheating issues. That’s true of both the launch variant and the new revised model that comes with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-cfi-1100-digital-foundry-analysis-204522648.html">smaller and lighter heatsink</a>. That said, running components at lower temperatures generally extends their lifespan over pushing them to the limit.  If you’re worried about dust making its way into your console, each set of Darkplates comes with a pair of mesh dust filters you can mount inside of the panels.</p><p>The new panels are available to pre-order starting today for an introductory price of $59.05 for the set. You can choose from three colors: matte black, retro gray and classic white. Alongside the faceplates, Dbrand is selling lightstrips you can use to tint your PS5’s side LEDs. They’re available in nine different colors, with a single one priced at $5.95. Dbrand will release the panels in waves, with the first, sold-out set shipping in November, and then the second and third waves following in December and January.</p><p>We wouldn’t necessarily count on plates making those dates. Dbrand says Sony will “probably” sue it again. It’s bullish on its prospects, but then again, it’s up against a much larger company.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dbrand-darkplates-2-0-162306317.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">18a490a2-0adf-4007-83a5-ecbef2551cb9</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 16:23:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634660653</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T16:24:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9f48d000-30f6-11ec-979f-021d5853cc16" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9f48d000-30f6-11ec-979f-021d5853cc16" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dbrand]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dbrand Darkplates 2.0]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dbrand Darkplates 2.0]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Google's Pixel 6 event with us here at 1PM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-google-pixel-6-event-130025254.html">Google&#39;s Pixel 6</a> is almost here after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">months of hype</a>.

As of today (October 19th), <a href="https://brave.com/download/">Brave</a> will use the engine as its browser&#39;s default search tool, replacing Google in the US, UK and Canada. It&#39;ll also supplant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-05-duckduckgo-tracker-radar-web-tracking.html">DuckDuckGo</a> in Germany and Qwant in France, with more countries seeing the switch in the &quot;next several months.&quot;</p><p>Your browser will keep its existing search engine settings, and you can always pick Google or another competitor if you&#39;re so inclined.

The social network is issuing a flurry of updates that will culminate on October 21st, when users worldwide will have the option of posting photos and short videos (under one minute) from their computer browser. That&#39;s helpful if you&#39;d rather not reach for your phone, of course, but it could be particularly useful for businesses and enthusiasts that want to make better use of their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7s-iii-mirrorless-camera-review-140041536.html">expensive cameras</a>.</p><p>There are plenty of updates for mobile users, too. A Collabs test feature available today (October 19th) lets two people co-author posts and Reels. You just have to invite someone else from the tagging screen to get them involved. Followers for both users will see the post, and it&#39;ll even share views, likes and comments. It&#39;s safe to say this could be valuable for everything from superstar team-ups to sponsored posts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another test coming on October 20th will let you start nonprofit fundraisers right from the new post button, simplifying charity efforts. Everyone will see new music-driven Reels effects on October 21st, including Superbeat (special effects in sync with the beat) and Dynamic Lyrics (3D lyrics that flow with the track). They&#39;re not as flashy as the other additions, but they may help you focus on sharing content rather than editing it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-desktop-web-post-creation-and-collabs-150032945.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7fad1fe3-197f-4550-a173-62a7e37aef93</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 15:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634652882</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T14:14:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ae392170-30e0-11ec-bdbf-14e0acba1750" width="1920" height="1150" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ae392170-30e0-11ec-bdbf-14e0acba1750" width="1920" height="1150" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram post creation on desktop web]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram post creation on desktop web]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon Music's spatial audio now works on any headphones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;ll be easier for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%20music%20unlimited"><ins>Amazon Music Unlimited</ins></a> subscribers to listen to music with spatial audio starting today.

Plus, it’s the only smart display that works with Messenger and Whatsapp, two of the most popular chat platforms in the world (with added support for platforms like Zoom last year). This year, Facebook is introducing a portable version called the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Portal Go" href="https://fave.co/3BRmo5r">Portal Go</a>, that you can drag around the house to make calls from any room.</p><p>That portability combined with a few software updates make the $199 Portal Go an improvement over its predecessor, but it still doesn’t have the same breadth of features as Google’s or Amazon’s smart displays. And, as with all things Facebook, it all comes down to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">whether you trust the company with your data</a> in the first place.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h3>Hardware</h3><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="41111047-cfec-4b76-9dfe-a0d1983cf1af"/><p>The Portal Go has a softer aesthetic than previous models, with a grey fabric enclosure that’s similar to Google’s Nest Hub. It has rounded corners and almost looks like the display has been stitched onto a pillow (albeit a not very plush one). All of these curves make the Go pleasant to hold or to prop up on your lap, which is important for a device that’s meant to be portable.</p><p>Along the top of the Go are the volume controls and a button that disables both the camera and the microphone; The status light will turn red when that happens. If you want to leave the microphone on but not the camera, you can slide a built-in cover over the lens. This way, you can still use voice commands and make calls without worrying that anyone is watching you.</p><p>On the front is a 10.1-inch display with the same 1,280 x 800 resolution as previous Portals, but that’s not a bad thing. It’s crisp, colorful and the viewing angles are great. It has the same adaptive lighting features too: Automatic screen brightness, color adjustment and a Night Mode that reduces the amount of blue light in the evening.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bb18e100-308b-11ec-9d7a-fe983f74b9a4" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="60df7fe8-0607-37ac-9dcf-3f42466097be"><figcaption>Facebook Portal Go</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The main difference between the Portal Go and its predecessors is that it doesn’t need to be plugged in all the time. Thanks to its  integrated handle and light weight, it’s easy to tote around with one hand. When it’s time to charge it, the device fits neatly into a proprietary 3-pin charging dock, too.</p><p>According to Facebook, the Portal Go will get up to five hours of Messenger calling on a charge, and up to 14 hours of music playback if the screen is off. But I actually managed to get six hours and five minutes of calling out of it before having to stick it back on the charging dock.</p><p>One of the benefits of the Go’s portability is that it is now effectively a portable speaker as well. The audio quality is pretty decent too, thanks to its two full-range speakers and subwoofer. The bass was relatively deep considering its size and the highs were clear. It’s not as good as the audio from my Sonos One of course, but it’ll do in a pinch.</p><h3>Video calls</h3><h3></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d5a01bb0-308b-11ec-bbfa-1a062042c366" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="2fd6b64b-4620-30f2-80d3-e411ac801547"><figcaption>Facebook Portal Go</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>It should go without saying that, like all Portal devices, the Go requires a Facebook account. (How else is it supposed to make Messenger calls?) You can choose to integrate your WhatsApp or Workplace account as well.</p><p>Basically, the Go is a smart display that’s meant to be as easy to tote around as a tablet. You can keep it docked in your office for most of the day, for example, but when it comes time to chat with grandma, you can carry it to whichever room the kids are in. I don’t have any kids, but I liked being able to set it up wherever the best lighting was at various times of day for calls.</p><p>The Go has a 12-megapixel wide-angle lens coupled with AI-powered tech that will automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame. Instead of crowding over an iPad, for example, you could just place the Go on a coffee table and get the whole family on the call. You can also double tap on someone’s face to “Spotlight” and keep the focus on them. I was impressed with how well it was able to “follow” me around the room, keeping me in frame as I wandered from my desk to my couch.</p><p>This automatic panning and zooming doesn’t just work in Messenger and WhatsApp, but also third-party video applications like Zoom and GoToMeeting. I should say, however, that this face-tracking technology also exists in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">Nest Hub Max</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Echo Show 8</a>, and they too have Zoom integration. However, only the Portals have Messenger and WhatsApp.</p><p>I was quite pleased with the video quality overall. I did notice occasional latency issues, but it wasn’t that bad. The Portal Go was able to handle different lighting conditions too; The colors were great even in relatively dim lighting. I did notice that calls in WhatsApp were a bit more pixelated than Messenger, but according to Facebook, that could be a bandwidth issue as they’re separate networks.</p><p>Facebook has also updated the Watch Together experience so it can be used not just on Portal-to-Portal calls, but also with Messenger contacts on other devices. It was a blast laughing over videos like 5-minute Crafts on calls with my friends. My main criticism is that we could only Watch Together clips that are on Facebook Watch. Portal devices unfortunately lack support for YouTube, which is a much more diverse source of video content.</p><p>Like previous Portals, the Go has AR features such as StoryTime, which is an AR storytelling experience, and PlayTime, which is an assortment of AR games. These are fun, but they’re the sort of thing you try once and never again.</p><h3>Interface</h3><h3></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/083ca6b0-308c-11ec-b3f7-c8a18df25a5c" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="65199236-8061-371d-be84-c3641ea350fa"><figcaption>Facebook Portal Go</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The whole Portal family got an update recently with a new, more personalized home screen. There’s a top row of favorite contacts that you can customize, and you’ll also see call notifications here.</p><p>Underneath the favorite contacts is an array of cards that lead to different apps, depending on what you have installed. I found the calendar card particularly useful, which not only shows upcoming events with handy links to join Zoom chats where relevant.</p><p>The Portal Go can be used by the whole family, but you might not trust everyone to use the device responsibly. That’s why Facebook introduced Household Mode, which restricts what users can do while it is enabled. For example, you can set it so that the Portal can only be used for Messenger calls to grandma and grandpa. You can then disable Household Mode to regain full control of the device.</p><p>By default, the Portal Go’s home screen will show stock art, but you can also customize it with a Digital Photo Frame app. When you tap the Apps button on the home screen, you’ll see an array of pre-installed apps like Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, Photo Booth, a browser, Facebook Live and Facebook Watch, and more are available for download.</p><p>As with previous Portals, the Go supports Alexa and the Facebook Assistant, which you summon by saying “Hey, Portal”. You can ask the Facebook Assistant to make Messenger and WhatsApp calls, play music, check the weather, create timers and launch apps. I also occasionally used it to change the voice options for different AR effects.</p><p>Alexa, on the other hand, is more for hearing the latest news or sports scores, building a shopping list and managing your smart home devices, which the Portal assistant can’t do.</p><p>Of course, with any Facebook product, privacy and security are obvious concerns, given the company’s terrible reputation. It said the AI-powered panning and zooming are processed locally on the device. Additionally, all WhatsApp calls are end-to-end encrypted by default. Messenger calls however, are not, and you’ll have to specify which contacts or groups you want to enable it with. Even then, encryption is still in the roll-out phase; I don’t currently have it.</p><h3>Competition</h3><h3></h3><p>While the Portal Go excels at video calls, it still lags behind the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Echo Show 8" href="https://amzn.to/2XrVsdF">Amazon Echo Show 8</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Google Nest Hub Max" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/15PEQR">Google Nest Hub Max</a> in basically every other department. Facebook doesn’t offer any streaming video options aside from its own, which means no Hulu, Netflix or YouTube. Plus, smart home features are buried in the Portal Go, while they’re front and center on the other devices.</p><p>To make matters worse, the Nest Hub Max and the Echo Show 8 have similar smart camera technology to the Portal Go, so that’s not a unique advantage for Facebook. And the $199 Go is even more expensive than the $130 Echo Show 8. (Though the Nest Hub Max is $229.) The Portal Go is the only one that’s battery-powered, however, while the other smart displays are stuck wherever you plug them in.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><h3></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/54fdb2f0-308c-11ec-a75f-971bbc2a307c" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="69f00563-9136-3898-a7fb-681e21a2be29"><figcaption>Facebook Portal Go</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The primary advantages that the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Go" href="https://fave.co/3BRmo5r">Go</a> has over other smart displays is its portability and Messenger and WhatsApp support. But both Google and Amazon make better devices with way more features. On top of that, Facebook’s poor reputation on privacy gives us pause on recommending it. You should only choose the Portal Go if Messenger and WhatsApp are the two video call services you use.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-go-review-140033819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a3ea2e36-91c0-4f85-979a-177a0092d646</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 14:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634661219</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T16:37:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/83341a20-308b-11ec-bdfd-7a74ae2a71f7" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/83341a20-308b-11ec-bdfd-7a74ae2a71f7" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Portal Go]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Portal Go]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Galaxy Watch 4 drops to new low of $220 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung&#39;s latest smartwatches are only a few months old but they&#39;ve just received their first discount on Amazon.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">Galaxy Watch 4 series</a> keeps this pattern going and they are the first devices to use the new Wear OS and One UI developed by Samsung and Google&#39;s new partnership. Tizen faithfuls will know their way around the UI — thankfully, the team decided to follow Samsung&#39;s lead in this case, adding only useful features into the mix like the ability to download Play Store apps directly to your wrist. You&#39;re also able to use gesture controls to do things like answer a call with a flick of your wrist.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Galaxy Watch 4 models are also solid fitness trackers. Inside is a new three-in-one biometric sensor that&#39;s faster and gives more accurate readings than those in previous models. It also helps enable things like bioelectrical impedance analysis for body mass scans. The Galaxy Watch 4 can also take blood oxygen readings, track sleep, detect if you&#39;re snoring at night and track 95 different workouts. If you&#39;re already an active person or are looking to get more active, chances are you&#39;ll be able to monitor all of your favorite exercises and more with this wearable.</p><p>On top of all that, the Galaxy Watch 4 models look pretty nice, too. The Watch 4 Classic has a physical rotating bezel and a stainless steel case, but otherwise it&#39;s the same as the standard Watch 4. Their screens are crisp and bright, and they&#39;re generally comfortable to wear all day long. General performance is good as well, although battery life could be better at just about one day. If you have an Android user — or a Samsung fan — in your life, the Galaxy Watch 4 would make a good gift this holiday season.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-drops-to-new-low-of-220-at-amazon-131549119.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42b5cf58-ba1d-439c-bf24-9a3ebbe8e5b9</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:15:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634648821</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T13:07:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4bc24470-0509-11ec-94e9-ed0b3ea276d8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4bc24470-0509-11ec-94e9-ed0b3ea276d8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A black Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 on a wrist]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iMovie for macOS Monterey can edit iPhone 13 Cinematic Mode videos]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You don&#39;t need <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-m1-pro-max-update-183550958.html">pro editing software</a> to work with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13&#39;s</a> Cinematic Mode video on your Mac. <em>AppleInsider</em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/19/apple-updates-imovie-for-mac-with-cinematic-mode-support-more">notes</a> Apple has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/imovie/id408981434">updated</a> iMovie for Mac to enable editing for Cinematic Mode footage.

It should be less clunky than the current system of direct sharing from the console.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of screenshots taken from the Create Menu or Create button shortcuts, you can share gameplay videos under three minutes in length up to 1080p (not 4K). For screenshots and videos to be auto-uploaded, make sure you&#39;ve linked your PS5 console to the PlayStation app. It also needs to be left in rest mode and have the &quot;Stay Connected to the Internet&quot; setting enabled.

As expected, its high-end laptops were the star of its Unleashed event yesterday and are the first machines powered by Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. (The company is borrowing iPhone nomenclature, it seems.)</p><p>It’s been hard for me to get too excited about the MacBook Pro’s slow, cautious evolution over the last few years. The OLED Touch Bar was a misstep, nixing function keys for a light-up bar with customizable touch panels. There were fewer ports than older models, including the SD card slot. This added another dongle to my bag, alongside a USB-C converter for any devices that hadn’t caught up with the MacBook’s own USB-C ports — which were few and far between. And don’t get me started on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-23-apple-macbook-keyboard-next-day-repairs-in-store.html"><ins>&quot;butterfly&quot; style keyboard </ins></a>that appeared in 2015.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ca2dc640-30c9-11ec-bf7d-59022bb1283a" style="height:422;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="423853ea-64c6-3d13-a4ba-69f42a2f5d6f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure></a><p>The 2021 MacBook Pro literally brushes away most of my problems. Yes, there’s an SD card reader, more ports, no more Touch Bar to accidentally hit and close internet tabs, more ports and a blast from the past.</p><p>Yep, MagSafe is back. While the term returned on recent iPhones, it’s been years since Apple offered the magnetic cable safety feature on its computers. It’s different from the old connector, and, in worst case scenarios, you can still charge through USB-C.</p><p>The screens have been expanded, featuring micro-LED display tech first used on iPad Pro and also marking the first appearance of a notch on MacBooks. Long live the notch!</p><p>These machines are for power users — and Apple is seriously talking up the capabilities of its new chips, more on that below. But that’s not what intrigues me. It’s the fact that Apple is walking back some of its pretty major missteps in recent MacBook Pro history and making it more usable in the process, tempting me to buy myself a new MacBook for the first time in a decade.</p><p>The 14-inch base model and 16-inch base model are set to start at $1,999 and $2,499 respectively. You can pre-order both today, with machines arriving on October 26th.

As we saw in our review of the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and colorful iMac, the M1 was a marvel, if not quite the pro-level of power many might have been expecting.</p><p>With the M1 Pro and M1 Max, the two chips underpinning the company&#39;s new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, it’s making a renewed pitch for power users. Both chips have 5nm 10-core processors, with eight high-performance cores and two high-efficiency units. Apple says the chips offer up to 1.7X faster performance than competing eight-core PC chips, which makes them particularly compelling for people doing heavy-duty 3D and video rendering.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-chips-macbook-pro-172415918.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-marvel-cinematic-universe-indiana-jones-delay-disney-plus-190758945.html">Disney delays all of Marvel’s 2022 films</a></h2><h2>At least three major movies will all hit Disney+ later as a result.</h2><h3></h3><p>Disney has shaken up its movie release calendar, with several Marvel Cinematic Universe flicks delayed.

But to be able to train its technology further, it has to hold trials in other locations with different environmental conditions — like Seattle. Zoox has <a href="https://zoox.com/journal/seattle/">announced</a> that it will soon start testing its L3 vehicles in the city to collect data and trial new hardware in the face of frequent rains.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;It rains more frequently in Seattle than it does in San Francisco,&quot; the company said in its announcement. Zoox built special hardware into its sensors to give its vehicles the capability to automatically remove water and debris when needed. The Seattle trial will help it validate whether its system and new hardware will work as intended. At the beginning of its trial, the company will deploy a small fleet of L3 vehicles to assess the demands of the Seattle area, including its narrow tunnels and one-way roads, before expanding its tests.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zoox <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoox-amazon-autonomous-robotaxi-153756758.html">introduced</a> a fully autonomous robotaxi last year, which is a tiny four-wheeled bi-directional vehicle without a steering wheel. Its existing L3 vehicles, however, are Toyota Highlanders outfitted with Zoox&#39;s sensors and powered by its autonomous driving software with a human driver behind the wheel. That said, all its vehicles will use the same sensor architecture, so any data the L3 vehicles collect will also benefit its Level-5 robotaxis.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-zoox-autonomous-vehicle-test-seattle-103516733.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">34c0202a-ec01-4e47-8ff4-d38614d088f9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 10:35:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634637398</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T09:56:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5a1cf420-30ba-11ec-8fff-55d93c7daf78" width="1360" height="816" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5a1cf420-30ba-11ec-8fff-55d93c7daf78" width="1360" height="816" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon Zoox]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Zoox]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Zoox]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Circul+ packs an ECG sensor into its heart-tracking ring]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bodimetrics is today announcing the second-generation of its Circul heart-rate monitoring smart ring, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Circul+" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=productpost2021&amp;subId3=Circul&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPrevention-circul-Wellness-Ring-Small%2F963895040">Circul+</a>.

The toy company has made a special edition the iconic Chatter telephone for its 60th anniversary — one that&#39;s fully functional and can make <em>and</em> receive calls. Before you start planning on where to display it at your home, know that it doesn&#39;t work as a landline unit. It connects to your iOS or Android phone via Bluetooth instead and has to be within 15 feet of your mobile device to work.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll get nine hours of talk time on the Chatter phone on a single charge, and it comes with a speakerphone button. Other than the features that make it a working device, this Chatter for grown-ups looks just like its toy counterpart with its rotary dial, red handset and wheels. While the device can&#39;t do anything other than make or take calls — and we doubt you&#39;d carry it wherever you go just for that purpose — it&#39;s a cool piece of novelty gadget that can bring on the nostalgia.

Dubbed <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified"><ins>Deck Verified</ins></a>, the system groups games into four categories: “Verified,” “Playable,” “Unsupported” and “Unkown.”</p><p>If you see a game with the first badge, it means it will work great out of the box. Of the playable category, Valve says you may need to do some tweaking. For example, in a title like <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, you might have to download a community controller configuration before you can use the Steam Deck’s thumbsticks and face buttons to play the game. Valve lists <em>Half-Life: Alyx </em>as an example of an experience that you won’t be able to play on Steam Deck, suggesting the unsupported category will be mostly occupied by VR titles. Lastly, an unknown tag means the company hasn’t had a chance to test that game for compatibility yet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d9479620-305a-11ec-b716-14107f830dc1" style="height:1359;width:2176;" alt="Deck Verified" data-uuid="335af147-8f73-3ec0-a3e9-f3569b800438"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure><p>To earn verified status, a game must meet four criteria. First, it should include full controller support, and the onscreen keyboard should appear when needed. Second, you shouldn’t see any compatibility warnings. The game should also support the Steam Deck’s native 1,280 by 800 resolution, and text should be easily readable. Lastly, if the title is playable through Proton, everything, including any anti-cheat software, should work through the compatibility layer.</p><p>To make things easy, you’ll see the badges appear both in your Steam library and the store. Moreover, each time you go to buy a game, you’ll see a full compatibility report that lists any issues to expect when playing it. Valve says it’s also working on a system that will allow you to see what compatibility category each game in your library falls under before Steam Deck is available in December.&nbsp;</p><p>If nothing else, the system should make it easier to decide if it makes sense to buy a Steam Deck. The last thing anyone wants is to spend $400 on a new gadget and not be able to play their favorite games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-verified-compatibility-system-223810108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3796e2fe-32a0-4147-930b-39fc511a2179</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 22:38:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634593925</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T21:52:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c3657980-305a-11ec-afff-77eb41597111" width="2174" height="1358" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c3657980-305a-11ec-afff-77eb41597111" width="2174" height="1358" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valve]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Valve Deck Verified]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Valve Deck Verified]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[EPA announces plans to regulate cancer-causing 'forever chemicals']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Showing up in everything from <a href="https://news.nd.edu/news/use-of-pfas-in-cosmetics-widespread-new-study-finds/">cosmetics</a> and dental floss to product packaging and cleaning supplies. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-explained">polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances</a>, or PFAS, are ubiquitous to the modern world. They&#39;re also known as &quot;forever chemicals&quot; as they do not break down in nature. What&#39;s more, they&#39;ve been linked to a host of human diseases, from thyroid conditions to certain cancers, which is why, in 2016, the Obama administration enacted a unenforceable recommendation limiting the amount of PFAS in a given product should not exceed 70 parts per trillion.

To that end, the administration plans to set enforceable drinking water limits under the Safe Drinking Water Act, designate PFAS as a hazardous substance under CERCLA (which would hold manufacturers financially liable for incinerating the chemical or releasing it into waterways), set timelines for establishing effluent guideline limitations under the Clean Water Act, review rules and guidance under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and expand monitoring, data collection and research of the chemicals. Additionally, the agency announced a new national testing strategy that will require PFAS manufacturers to provide toxicity data on the chemicals they create.&nbsp;</p><div id="adb030b67d7f4f68a87e235e5086936a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W74aeuqsiU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>“Communities contaminated by these toxic forever chemicals have waited decades for action,” Ken Cook, President of the Environmental Working Group, said in a press statement. “So, it’s good news that Administrator Regan will fulfill President Biden’s pledge to take quick action to reduce PFOA and PFOS in tap water, to restrict industrial releases of PFAS into the air and water, and to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances to hold polluters accountable. It’s been more than 20 years since EPA and EWG first learned that these toxic forever chemicals were building up in our blood and increasing our likelihood of cancer and other health harms. It’s time for action, not more plans, and that’s what this Administrator will deliver.&quot;</p><p>A handful of states including New Jersey, Vermont, Michigan, and New York, have already moved to regulate the chemicals on their own — California banned their use in baby and toddler products earlier this year — while the EU has banned many of the chemicals outright.

After the by-the-numbers affair that was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-supercut-201538409.html"><ins>iPhone 13 event</ins></a>, Monday’s presentation was a more exciting thing to watch, thanks in large part to the first significant refresh to the MacBook Pro in five years. Here’s everything the company announced at the event.</p><h2>MacBook Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/97969f70-303a-11ec-9fff-50d91433effd" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Macbook Pro 2021 redesign" data-uuid="d993983f-b5e7-3916-b2d2-6bcd4d785116"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Unsurprisingly, the redesigned MacBook Pros were the star of the show, and there’s a lot to unpack between the two new 14- and 16-inch models. As expected, both laptops represent a return to form for the MacBook Pro line. Apple has replaced the Touch Bar with a standard set of function keys, as well as added MagSafe, an SD card slot and an HDMI port. New to both computers are 120Hz ProMotion displays. The 14-inch model will run its screen at 3,024 x 1,964, while the 16-inch variant has a 3,456 x 2,234 panel. Each also has an iPhone-style camera notch that is likely to be divisive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, you can configure both models with Apple’s new, more powerful M1 Pro and Max chips (more on them in a moment). All those new features come at a cost, with the 14-inch base model and 16-inch base model set to start at $1,999 and $2,499 respectively. You can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-apple-airpods-third-generation-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-m1-pro-m1-max-182308261.html"><ins>pre-order</ins></a> both computers today, with general availability to follow on October 26th. In the meantime, macOS Monterey will land the day before on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-monterey-release-date-180751313.html"><ins>October 25th</ins></a>.</p><h2>M1 Pro and M1 Max</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d6db100-303e-11ec-abf7-2f2e15bed89c" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max chip" data-uuid="1328c132-0b4e-3f19-bec9-aaad1bf72bac"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><h2></h2><p>At the heart of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros are Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. Both feature 5nm 10-core processors made up of eight high-performance cores and two high-efficiency units. Where they differ from one another is in terms of potential video and memory performance. The M1 Pro comes with up to 16 GPU cores and can support up to 32GB of RAM with 200 GB/s of bandwidth. The M1 Max, meanwhile, tops out at 32 graphics cores and double the RAM and memory bandwidth. In practice, Apple claims the chips are 70 percent faster than its previous M1 SoC and offer up to 1.7 times faster performance than competing CPUs from Intel and AMD. They should also make short work of the company’s updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-m1-pro-max-update-183550958.html"><ins>Final Cut and Logic suites</ins></a>.</p><h2>AirPods</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a063b920-3036-11ec-b7d7-7c35df5aba66" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Airpods" data-uuid="fc33df11-85c2-36bb-bbff-777d0bd788eb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Going into Monday’s event, we were confident Apple would update its “basic” AirPods. But other than an AirPods Pro-like design, we weren’t expecting them to get many new features. So what we saw today was a surprise. While you won’t find ANC on the updated AirPods, they do include support for Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and Adaptive EQ. The latter allows the AirPods to adjust the low and mid-range frequencies of audio in real-time. Other notable specs include IPX4 sweat and water resistance and up to 30 hours total of battery life with help from the included charging case.</p><p>You can pre-order the new AirPods starting today for $179. They’ll begin shipping on October 26th. For those who want to save some money, Apple has discounted the second-generation AirPods to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-second-gen-discount-173918293.html"><ins>$129</ins></a>.</p><h2>Apple Music Voice Plan</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0df6fb60-3036-11ec-afd7-07a954a8ac88" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Apple HomePod Mini" data-uuid="e9285fd7-982a-3b8c-a479-8500ca331028"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Alongside the third-generation AirPods, the company announced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-plan-171329499.html"><ins>discounted Apple Music</ins></a> plan.

According to <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/18/exclusive-these-are-the-new-beats-fit-pro-earbuds/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>, the earbuds will be like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">Beats Studio Buds</a> which were released earlier this year, albeit with a slightly different design. The outlet found these images of the product in internal iOS 15.1 RC files.</p><p>Sources also told <em>9to5Mac</em> that the Beats Fit Pro will have Active Noise Cancellation, Class 1 Bluetooth and Apple’s H1 chip for fast pairing with Apple products. It’ll apparently also feature a built-in accelerometer that’s designed to reduce external noise. As for battery life, the outlet reports that it’ll have 6 hours with ANC or Transparency Mode enabled or 7 hours with Adaptive EQ. The charging case will supposedly give it a total of around 27 to 30 hours of charge.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>9to5Mac</em> reports that Beats Fit Pro is scheduled to be announced the week of November 1st, with shipment occurring later.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-leak-191933131.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f848360b-96a6-491f-89d5-06676815a692</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 19:19:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634585300</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T19:28:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6871b130-3049-11ec-b99b-8bd3248124fa" width="1336" height="758" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6871b130-3049-11ec-b99b-8bd3248124fa" width="1336" height="758" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[9to5Mac]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro leaked images.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Disney delays all of Marvel’s 2022 films]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/disney/">Disney</a> has shaken up its movie release calendar, with several <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel%20cinematic%20universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> flicks being delayed. The revamped schedule, which <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/disney-delays-doctor-strange-thor-black-panther-1235091673/"><em>Variety</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reports is due to a production-related snowball effect, affects the slate for 2022 and beyond, and it will have a knock-on effect on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/disney%20plus">Disney+</a>.</p><p>All of the MCU films Disney had on the docket for 2022 have been pushed to a later slot. <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </em>was penciled in for March 25th, but now it&#39;s taking <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>&#39;s old date of May 6th. The next Thor movie will arrive on July 8th, in turn pushing back <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> to November 11th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The schedule shifts mean there will only be three Marvel movies next year instead of the planned four, as <em>Captain Marvel</em> sequel <em>The Marvels </em>now has a release date of February 17th, 2023. <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania </em>has moved from that date to July 28th, 2023. On the flip side, Disney brought one mystery Marvel movie (hopefully <em>Guardians of the Galaxy 3</em>) forward by a week from November 10th, 2023.</p><p>Elsewhere, the next Indiana Jones movie has been delayed by 11 months. You&#39;ll need to wait until June 30th, 2023 for Harrison Ford&#39;s fifth stint as the iconic archeologist. Ford sustained an injury while filming this summer, though he&#39;s now back in action. A live-action Disney movie, a 20th Century film and two Marvel flicks (all untitled) have been removed from the 2023 schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>Remarkably, given how many times the film has been delayed over the years, Disney hasn&#39;t shifted Avatar 2&#39;s release date. It&#39;s still on the schedule for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-avatar-delay-220932930.html">December 16th, 2022</a>.</p><p>It remains to be seen what impact these changes will have on Disney+. For the rest of 2021, Disney has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html">committed to an exclusive theatrical window</a> for its films before they&#39;re available to stream, but it hasn&#39;t divulged how things will work in 2022 and beyond.</p><p>The company adopted a simultaneous release strategy for some of its movies over the last year or so amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-mulan-release-182440824.html"><em>Mulan</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/raya-and-the-last-dragon-disney-plus-220319407.html"><em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em></a><em>, Cruella </em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-184407477.html"><em>Black Widow</em></a> requiring a $30 Premier Access pass for early access on Disney+. Disney&#39;s decision to let viewers stream <em>Black Widow </em>at home on the same day it hit theaters <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html">prompted</a> a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-settles-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit-black-widow-024836370.html">now-settled lawsuit</a> from star Scarlett Johansson. Pixar movies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-pixar-soul-224512241.html"><em>Soul</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-pixar-luca-review-160036700.html"><em>Luca</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>went straight to streaming as part of regular Disney+ subscriptions in some countries.</p><p>Elsewhere, some MCU shows on Disney+, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-loki-finale-episode-six-163019038.html"><em>Loki</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-hawkeye-trailer-premiere-date-clint-barton-kate-bishop-hailee-steinfeld-140006373.html"><em>Hawkeye</em></a>, tie into the theatrical movies.

The company has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-updated-on-the-new-macbook-pro-with-m1-pro-m1-max/">released</a> new versions of Final Cut Pro (10.6) and Logic Pro (10.7) that make the most of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, particularly in video processing and machine learning. FCP editors can play up to seven streams of 8K ProRes at once, and export in the format over five times faster — no mean feat for a laptop, as Apple was keen to point out. You can even color-grade 8K HDR footage using only the MacBook Pro&#39;s built-in screen.</p><p>There&#39;s also a new Object Tracker you can use to link animated effects to faces and objects. You can easily edit Cinematic Mode video from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone 13 series</a>, too. Motion now renders visual effects work up to two times faster, and can play two 8K video streams at five times the previous frame rate. Compressor, meanwhile, transcodes HEVC video up to twice as fast, and ProRes up to ten times as quickly. And if you live in Canon&#39;s world, you can transcode Cinema RAW Light videos to other formats for the first time. There&#39;s even a Watch Folders feature that will automatically encode content when it reaches a given folder — helpful for streamlining a workflow, particularly among teams.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Logic Pro update, meanwhile, is focused on spatial audio creation — just in time for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-gen-announced-price-specs-availability-171540519.html">new AirPods</a>, of course. New mixers, panners and plugins let you author Dolby Atmos tracks, and the new MacBook Pros can use their added performance to create particularly advanced mixes. The music editing tool now comes bundled with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/garageband-dua-lipa-lady-gaga-remix-mark-ronson-172019456.html">Producer Packs</a> you saw in GarageBand, too, so you can integrate royalty-free beats and samples from the likes of Boys Noize, Mark Ronson and Trakgirl.</p><p>Both updates are free for existing users. Final Cut Pro normally costs $300 for new users, with Motion and Compressor costing $50 each. Logic Pro is priced at $200. The upgrades make the most sense if you&#39;re deeply invested in ProRes or intend to publish on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-plan-171329499.html">Apple Music</a>. Still, it&#39;s easy to see the appeal, at least for FCP. You could quickly turn around certain video projects using only your MacBook Pro, even if you&#39;re working primarily with 8K footage.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-m1-pro-max-update-183550958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cee5f04d-d7a0-4b32-b2eb-ba67b0b71615</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 18:35:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634582153</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T18:35:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe2eeff0-303d-11ec-9ab7-c35e7aaad8af" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe2eeff0-303d-11ec-9ab7-c35e7aaad8af" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro optimized for MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro optimized for MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
