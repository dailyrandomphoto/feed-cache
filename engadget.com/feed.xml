After launching in other regions last year, the Xperia 5 III is <a href="https://www.sony.com/content/sony/en/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-electronics/2022/sony-electronics-highly-anticipated-xperia-5-iii-smartphone-now-shipping-in-the-united-states.html">now available</a> stateside for $1,000, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/sonys-compact-xperia-5-iii-comes-to-the-us-for-1000/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>The Xperia 5 III is slightly smaller than the company&#39;s consumer flagship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-xperia-5-iii-pro-camera-smartphones-5g-specs-074022474.html">Xperia 1 III</a> but has pretty similar specs. It comes with a Snapdragon 888 SoC, 6.1-inch 2,520 x 1,080 (21:9) 120Hz display, 8GB of RAM (compared to 12GB for the 1 III) and 128GB of storage, along with a triple camera setup with a 12-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide and 12-megapixel 3x telephoto. It offers a Gorilla Glass 6 display and IP65/68 water resistance and if you don&#39;t mind Sony&#39;s typically squarish design cues, looks very premium.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7d3f3ef45b324563b5f0915371309f9f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NvdKscFh5zA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The display delivers 10-bit color depth and is &quot;powered by CineAlta&quot; (the name of its high-end <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-09-07-sonys-f65-cinealta-4k-camera-now-available-for-a-paltry-65-000.html">cinema cameras</a>) so it should show accurate colors and skin tones. The cameras aren&#39;t particularly high-resolution, but they do have Zeiss lenses &quot;calibrated specifically for Xperia,&quot; Sony said. The main camera has a stacked backside illuminated Exmor RS image sensor, delivering 20fps burst speeds with AF and AE tracking. On the video side, it offers Cinematography Pro also powered by CineAlta, with 4K HDR at up to 120 fps.</p><p>In other words, this is a camera-first smartphone designed for folks who are really into photography or video.  It&#39;s not for everyone considering it costs <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/x9mrGx">$1,000 at Best Buy</a> and elsewhere, but it&#39;s nice to have another premium smartphone option for the US market.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonys-high-end-compact-xperia-5-iii-comes-to-the-us-for-1000-095934384.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dfe4b687-31fc-42eb-8a46-2cfbe2b228a2</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 09:59:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642068136</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T10:02:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9c7451f0-744f-11ec-b3d7-27354a905d10" width="800" height="450" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9c7451f0-744f-11ec-b3d7-27354a905d10" width="800" height="450" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony Electronics, Inc.]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony Electronics' Highly Anticipated Xperia 5 III Smartphone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony's high-end, compact Xperia 5 III comes to the US for $1,000]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pioneer DJ debuts DDJ-REV series of battle-style controllers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Battle DJs, the turntablists that perfect the art of cutting and scratching music to build new creations on-the-fly are getting some new gear for the mobile digital world. Until now, most devices for this style of mixing have either been the classic turntables and mixer combo, or pricey modular units. Today, Pioneer DJ announces its new DDJ-REV controller series focused on the battle DJ’s style of mixing and aimed at both novices and pros alike. The new entry-level <a href="https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-rev1/black/overview/#utm_source=PR_EN&amp;utm_medium=in-feed-link&amp;utm_campaign=DDJ-REV1-Promotion-20220113&amp;utm_id=ATC">DDJ-REV1</a> ($259) and the pro-level <a href="https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-us/product/controller/ddj-rev7/black/overview/#utm_source=PR_EN-US&amp;utm_medium=in-feed-link&amp;utm_campaign=DDJ-REV7-Promotion-20220113&amp;utm_id=ATC">DDJ-REV7</a> ($1,899) are both Serato DJ compatible and offer an adjusted layout for fans of the sideways turntable and the Pioneer DJM-S series of mixers.</p><p>Newcomers interested in this style of DJing can get a taste of what’s to come, with a few useful flourishes for the livestreaming generation. The 2-channel DDJ-REV1 controller runs Serato DJ Lite and includes a 14-day trial of Serato DJ Pro. It’s bus-powered, has slightly larger jog wheels than prior models in this price range and includes a mic input so you can get chatty during livestreams without extra gear. Along with the mic, the only other input is the USB port, and you only get a single RCA master output.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although pint-sized, the layout echoes a classic battle DJ’s choice with platters at the bottom and a horizontal pitch slider up top. A sideways turntable allowed easier scratching without the tonearm getting in the way, which resulted in an unusual placement for the pitch control. It seems some have gotten used to that layout and this type of controller layout caters to that familiarity.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c5a1a040-7329-11ec-bf9e-13ce4142c2c8" alt="Pioneer DJ / Serato DJ - DDJ-REV1 controller" data-uuid="2917ed12-5120-36ea-9be7-58a964cea0c8"><figcaption>The DDJ-REV1 controller.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pioneer DJ</div></figure><p>The central mixing panel also borrows from the popular Pioneer DJM-S series, with performance pads in the middle and lockable FX toggles. There’s also a Scratch Bank to store your choice of audio clips and the Tracking Scratch feature. This saves you having to get back to a scratchable cue point by doing it for you when you remove your hands from the ridged capacitive jog wheel or spin it back.</p><p>If you have more seasoned skills and/or more money to spend, the 2-channel DDJ-REV7 is a better fit. This higher-end model includes 7-inch motorized jog wheels with vinyl-mimicking top plates and adjustable torque for a classic turntable feel. Each side also includes a 3.5-inch on-jog display where you can see waveforms and other data, or switch to a Serato virtual deck view, song artwork or your own logo with easy-to-see omnidirectional viewing.</p><p>As with the economy model, the DDJ-REV7 mimics a classic cut and scratch layout with the DJM-S styled central mixer, performance pads and FX toggle. Those jog wheels are along the front edge with the pitch slider on the top. Relevant control buttons live in between those, somewhat reminiscent of the Pioneer CDJ series layout.</p><p>Other highlights for the DDJ-REV7 are onboard scratch samples, a Maglev Fader Pro and 22 built-in Beat FX. If you want to flank your controller with turntables or CDJs, you’re in luck since there are line and phono inputs on each channel. Plan to swap with another DJ during live sets? The dual USB ports will make life easier. You&#39;ll need a computer for most things, since there&#39;s no thumb drive or microSD slot. It <em>seems</em> you can store full tracks in the on-board scratch bank along with clips, but that&#39;s no real solution. For outputs you&#39;ll get XLR and RCA ports for master out, plus balanced 1/4-inch TRS for the booth.</p><p>The entry-level <a href="https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-rev1/black/overview/#utm_source=PR_EN&amp;utm_medium=in-feed-link&amp;utm_campaign=DDJ-REV1-Promotion-20220113&amp;utm_id=ATC">DDJ-REV1</a> is expected to be available in late January at the retail price of $259 and works with the free Serato DJ Lite (<a href="https://serato.com/dj/lite/downloads">1.5.9</a>) software, although the pro version will also work. Those interested in the high-end <a href="https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-us/product/controller/ddj-rev7/black/overview/#utm_source=PR_EN-US&amp;utm_medium=in-feed-link&amp;utm_campaign=DDJ-REV7-Promotion-20220113&amp;utm_id=ATC">DDJ-REV7</a> ($1,899) will have to wait until February, although no solid availability date has been confirmed. This model includes a license for Serato DJ Pro (<a href="https://serato.com/dj/pro/downloads">2.5.9</a>) and a voucher for the Serato Pitch ‘n’ Time expansion.</p><div id="a5fd00e2cfb34c7eb9024e832b97fc18"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sXSyG352Wak?rel=0&amp;start=243" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pioneer-dj-ddj-rev1-rev7-battle-style-controllers-serato-080006088.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">54998d4d-266b-4312-aea6-070d9a9674d3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Turi</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 08:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642001489</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T15:31:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Turi]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/56df52b0-7310-11ec-bf2f-d809f67cd31e" width="3300" height="1946" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/56df52b0-7310-11ec-bf2f-d809f67cd31e" width="3300" height="1946" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pioneer DJ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pioneer DJ / Serato - DDJ-REV7 controller]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Pioneer DJ / Serato - DDJ-REV7 controller]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple details $30 million settlement for off-the-clock bag search lawsuit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The long-running lawsuit Apple faced over off-the-clock bag searches of its employees in California is almost over. While its final approval hearing won&#39;t take place until July, the tech giant has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/apple-bag-check-lawsuit-settlement/?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds">detailed</a> the terms of the $29.9 million settlement <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-offers-30-million-to-settle-off-the-clock-bag-search-controversy-084819770.html">it agreed to</a> and provided claimants (and everyone else) access to documents related to the case on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/settlement/apple-bag-check-settlement.html">legal website</a>. The list of documents includes everything from the original class action complaint to notices of the settlement to different types of class members. It also includes information on how to get in contact with the settlement administrator.</p><p>A group Apple employees sued the company in 2013 for not paying them for the time it took to check their bags during their shifts or when they&#39;re leaving for work, which took between five to 20 minutes. They claimed Apple was violating California law by doing so. Apple said bag checks were necessary to ensure workers weren&#39;t leaving with stolen goods or trade secrets and tried to argue in court that those who didn&#39;t like the policy could simply not bring their bags or their iPhones to work. The company stopped searching employees&#39; bags in 2015.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While a district court originally tossed the lawsuit, it went to the California Supreme Court on appeal, wherein the judge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-apple-pay-employees-bag-searches-lost-time.html">sided</a> with the plaintiffs. As previously <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/apple-to-pay-30-million-over-security-checks-for-store-workers?sref=10lNAhZ9">revealed</a> in a court filing, the lawsuit covers 14,683 workers in 52 Apple Stores in California who were subjected to bag checks from July 25th, 2009 until August 10th, 2015. They&#39;ll each get $1,286 from the settlement amount.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-details-settlement-off-the-clock-bag-search-lawsuit-071600545.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ffac6ca-219a-4fea-a2a4-6f27a73587d8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 07:16:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642058160</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T08:58:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/6e46d850-7438-11ec-bbf9-a1cfe5b6963f" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/6e46d850-7438-11ec-bbf9-a1cfe5b6963f" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Noah Sauve via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Glendale, California - July 16, 2021: The Apple store at the Americana at Brand outdoor shopping center]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The Apple Store at the Americana at Brand in Glendale, California]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch will launch an improved reporting and appeals process in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following a year that saw it struggle to shield its users from abuse and harassment, Twitch has <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/safety-news/detail?language=en_US&amp;post=An-Open-Letter-from-Our-Head-of-Trust-and-Safety"><ins>published a retrospective</ins></a> of its 2021 safety efforts that includes a look forward to how the company plans to tackle the issue in 2022. Specifically, Angela Hession, Twitch’s vice president of global trust and safety, says the company will update its user reporting and appeals process.&nbsp;</p><p>It also plans to upgrade its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-suspicious-user-detection-announcement-000510859.html"><ins>Suspicious User Detection</ins></a> feature. The AI tool, which the company launched at the end of last year, automatically flags individuals it believes may be repeat ban dodgers. In 2022, Twitch has updates planned around how streamers can use information from that tool. As the company has indicated previously, it also plans to update its sexual content policy to clarify various aspects of it. Twitch simultaneously intends to share more and “better” educational content across its safety center and other areas.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitch spent much of the latter half of 2021 trying to stop automated &quot;hate raid&quot; harassment campaigns. The attacks saw malicious individuals use thousands of bots to spam channels with hateful language, and they frequently targeted streamers from marginalized communities. In September, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-sues-hate-raiders-cruzzcontrol-and-creatine-overdose-184439305.html">sued</a> CruzzControl and CreatineOverdose, two of the more prolific individuals involved in those campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We’ll likely never be able to eliminate [hate raids] entirely,&quot; Hession said. However, she claims Twitch  &quot;significantly&quot; cut down on the number of bots on its platform through some of its actions in 2021. In 2022, it looks to continue that work through the improvements it announced today.&nbsp;</p><p>If the company’s safety roadmap feels light on details, Hession says that’s out of necessity. “The honest and unfortunate reality is that we can&#39;t always be specific because bad actors can and have used that transparency to attempt to thwart our efforts,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the executive acknowledged Twitch needs to do a better job of communicating what it’s doing to make people feel safe on its platform. It’s easy to see why the company would say that. When it felt like the hate raids that were occurring on Twitch couldn’t get any worse, many creators banded together to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamers-are-taking-a-day-off-next-week-to-protest-hate-raids-065515266.html"><ins>protest</ins></a> the lack of action they saw from the company.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-2022-safety-plans-232940991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bd42848-2e68-4375-90d4-d4a228426c85</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 23:29:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642030259</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T08:59:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e77c3c50-0b2f-11ec-963f-12463c6b2860" width="3500" height="2333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e77c3c50-0b2f-11ec-963f-12463c6b2860" width="3500" height="2333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A man works at a computer at the offices of Twitch Interactive Inc, a social video platform and gaming community owned by Amazon, in San Francisco, California, U.S., March 6, 2017.

Platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-kids-074628334.html">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-policy-204452958.html">Twitter</a> have adopted policies in an effort to curtail rampant false claims, but some don&#39;t have rules in place. A group of 270 doctors, nurses, scientists and educators <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/covid-misinformation-joe-rogan-spotify-petition-1282240/">have sent an open letter to Spotify</a> following a recent episode of <em>The</em><em>Joe Rogan Experience</em>, calling for the streaming service to adopt a clear policy and to fulfill its &quot;responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>On the December 31st episode of his podcast, Joe Rogan interviewed Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who says he&#39;s one of the creators of mRNA technology. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/robert-malone-vaccine-inventor-vaccine-skeptic/619734/">unclear</a> whether that&#39;s true. During the chat, Malone made baseless claims about COVID-19, including the idea that &quot;mass formation psychosis&quot; led people to believe the vaccines were effective and the notion that President Biden had withheld data that supported ivermectin as a valid treatment. The episode quickly went viral among both critics and fans as Rogan averages over 10 million listeners per episode. YouTube <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/joe-rogan-podcast-youtube-robert-malone-b1986008.html">removed a video of the interview</a> and Malone was recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2021/12/31/prominant-virologist-kicked-off-twitter-for-spreading-anti-vaxx-video-15844655/">banned from Twitter</a> for violations of the platform&#39;s COVID-19 misinformation policy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;By allowing the propagation of false and societally harmful assertions, Spotify is enabling its hosted media to damage public trust in scientific research and sow doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance offered by medical professionals,&quot; <a href="https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/">the letter explains</a>. &quot;[The episode] is not the only transgression to occur on the Spotify platform, but a relevant example of the platform’s failure to mitigate the damage it is causing.&quot;</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19"><em>The Verge reported</em></a> that Spotify was okay with a Rogan episode on which he encouraged 21-year-olds to not get vaccinated. A company source indicated the message wasn&#39;t &quot;outwardly anti-vaccine&quot; and he didn&#39;t &quot;make a call to action,&quot; <em>The Verge&#39;s </em>Ashley Carman wrote at the time. Spotify has taken down more explicit examples of vaccine misinformation, including <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ian-brown-says-spotify-have-taken-down-his-anti-lockdown-song-little-seed-big-tree-2899613">a song from musician Ian Brown</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/pete-evans-spotify-ban-2021-1">a podcast from Pete Evans</a>. The company has said in the past that it &quot;prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, deceptive, or misleading content about COVID-19 that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health.&quot; And that when something violates those guidelines, it is removed.</p><p>However, as this open letter points out, Spotify doesn&#39;t have an official misinformation policy like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and others. The group is asking for the platform to do just that, rather than to directly take action against Rogan or remove the episode in question. They want the company to create rules that would hold podcast creators accountable for the content of their shows.</p><p>Spotify paid a reported $100 million to lock down <em>The Joe Rogan Experience </em>as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-joe-rogan-experience-exclusive-podcast-203044280.html">an exclusive podcast</a> in 2020. The show was the most popular on the platform in 2021, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html">both in the US and globally</a>. When Rogan faced criticism over his choice of guests, including another example of pandemic misinformation in an episode with Alex Jones, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek said the platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-ceo-editorial-responsibility-podcasts-040340113.html">didn&#39;t have editorial responsibility</a> over podcasts.</p><p>&quot;We have a lot of really well-paid rappers on Spotify too, that make tens of millions of dollars, if not more, each year from Spotify.&quot; <a href="https://www.axios.com/spotify-ceo-daniel-ek-talks-future-of-podcasts-93925d11-d002-478b-81fb-c371743f6c3c.html">Ek told Axios</a><em>.</em> &quot;And we don&#39;t dictate what they&#39;re putting in their songs, either.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify didn&#39;t respond to Engadget&#39;s request for comment on both the open letter and the company&#39;s misinformation policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-health-misinformation-covid-19-open-letter-215921304.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f8ba7181-ef64-4b91-90a7-f5f1932ab7ff</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 21:59:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642026567</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T22:29:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a3186620-6fe2-11ec-bff7-826c8421d0c4" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a3186620-6fe2-11ec-bff7-826c8421d0c4" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carmen Mandato via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 10: Joe Rogan introduces fighters during the UFC 269 ceremonial weigh-in  at MGM Grand Garden Arena on December 10, 2021 in Las Vegas, Nevada.

We recently highlighted the Wyze Cam V3 as our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html"><ins>favorite overall home security camera</ins></a>, thanks to its low price and handy selection of features. Although a subscription isn&#39;t totally necessary for the company&#39;s cameras, it does offer extra utility. With that in mind, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wyze/"><ins>Wyze</ins></a> is opening up a new subscription tier to everyone.</p><p>The <a href="https://forums.wyzecam.com/t/we-re-giving-wyze-person-detection-to-all-users-at-whatever-price-you-want-1-11-22/211282"><ins>Cam Plus Lite plan</ins></a> includes AI-powered Person Detection (instead of motion detection) and 12-second event recordings. Here&#39;s the twist: it&#39;s a pay-what-you-want plan, so you&#39;ll have access to those features without having to pay a monthly or annual fee.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The existing Cam Plus plan costs $2 per month or $15 per year. It supports back-to-back event recordings (instead of one every five minutes). Other features include full-length video recording for as long as motion is detected, and package, vehicle and pet detection.</p><p>Until now, Wyze cameras have captured 12-second clips as often as every five minutes when they detect an event, and those recordings are stored for up to 14 days. Wyze is moving that feature to its subscriptions, though, you&#39;ll need to opt in to the Cam Plus or Cam Plus Lite plan to keep using cloud recordings.</p><p>Wyze says it&#39;s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/wyze-cam-plus-lite-subscription/">pairing</a> cloud recordings with the AI-powered Person Detection feature in the Cam Plus Lite plan to make them more useful and cut down on unnecessary notifications that might be triggered by a clip of, say, an insect flying in front of the camera. The company believes this approach will improve the overall experience, though it said it will incur significant cloud costs as a result. As such, while it won&#39;t make users pay for those features, it&#39;s hoping they&#39;ll contribute what they can to help cover the costs for everyone.</p><p>If you don&#39;t <a href="https://services.wyze.com/purchase/type/person-detection">opt in</a> to Cam Plus Lite, your cameras will store thumbnails of what they detect, rather than video. You&#39;ll still be able to sign up for Cam Plus Lite at any time.</p><p>Wyze is making some changes to the local storage options too. It will support microSDXC cards with more than 32GB of storage. That feature&#39;s available on Wyze Cam v3 now, and it&#39;s coming to the company&#39;s other cameras as part of their next firmware update. By the middle of February, Wyze will roll out 30-second rewind and skp forward buttons to help users zip through footage stored on a microSD card faster.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/wyze-cam-plus-lite-plan-a-pay-what-you-want-security-camera-211502333.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02592e1c-4b54-446f-a2f2-07c1a90c3807</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 21:15:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642021513</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T21:05:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ff264320-73e7-11ec-be5e-dd3944435101" width="799" height="561" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ff264320-73e7-11ec-be5e-dd3944435101" width="799" height="561" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wyze]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Wyze Cam V3.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wyze Cam V3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FCC proposes stricter requirements for reporting data breaches]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is the next US regulator hoping to hold companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-rules-that-health-apps-must-notify-consumers-if-their-data-is-breached-114043312.html">more accountable for data breaches</a>. Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/chair-rosenworcel-circulates-new-data-breach-reporting-requirements">shared</a> a rulemaking proposal that would introduce stricter requirements for data breach reporting. Most notably, the new rules would require notifications for customers affected by &quot;inadvertent&quot; breaches — companies that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-power-apps-data-exposed-report-covid-19-api-configuration-165453736.html">leave data exposed</a> would have to be just as communicative as victims of cyberattacks.</p><p>The requirements would also scrap a mandatory one-week waiting period for notifying customers.

In other words, if you’ve been holding off on installing iOS 15, now is the time to update your Apple devices.</p><p><strong>Update 01/13/22 12:45AM ET:</strong> We corrected a typo regarding Apple&#39;s timeline to address the vulnerability (<em>thanks, Richard</em>).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-2-1-homekit-vulerability-fix-201158978.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9b6fc46-7c0b-40cc-8d8b-2509cd41511d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 20:11:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642060446</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T08:58:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f21ed3b0-ff82-11eb-bcf5-db7b17ce6029" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f21ed3b0-ff82-11eb-bcf5-db7b17ce6029" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iOS 15 beta on iPhone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iOS 15 beta on iPhone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch streamers can now give their followers free emotes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting today, most <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitch/"><ins>Twitch</ins></a> partners and affiliates will be able to dole out emotes to community members just for following them.

Netflix was still the frontrunner with one or more <a href="https://www.sagawards.org/awards/nominees-and-recipients/28th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards">nominations</a> in nearly every category, including multiple picks for <em>The Power of the Dog</em> (three) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-142-million-households-squid-game-070044407.html"><em>Squid Game</em></a> (four) as well as individual nods for productions like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dont-look-up-review-dicaprio-climate-change-180058853.html"><em>Don&#39;t Look Up</em></a>, <em>Passing</em> and <em>Halston</em>. However, Apple also fared particularly well this year — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ted-lasso-season-two-july-23-apple-tv-plus-225341867.html"><em>Ted Lasso</em></a> received five nominations, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-show-season-2-teaser-apple-tv-plus-141241307.html"><em>The Morning Show</em></a> racked up four. <em>Coda</em> and the not-quite-released <em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em> also burnished Apple&#39;s image.</p><p>Other services also had their due. Amazon had success with titles like <em>Being the Ricardos</em> and <em>The Tender Bar</em>, while Disney&#39;s empire made its presence felt with nominations for <em>The Handmaid&#39;s Tale</em> and Disney+ series like <em>Loki</em> and <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix also broke a cultural boundary — <em>Squid Game</em><a href="https://twitter.com/squidgame/status/1481300075989303297">is the first</a> non-English series to receive a SAG nomination, not to mention the first Korean series. This isn&#39;t completely surprising given Netflix&#39;s eagerness to produce worldwide blockbusters, but it&#39;s notable given how difficult it has been for foreign releases to crack these awards.</p><p>Theater- and TV-first material still has a significant presence in SAG&#39;s nominations. Nonetheless, it&#39;s evident the partial return to normalcy in entertainment only had a limited effect — streamed shows are still thriving in the current awards landscape.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sag-awards-2022-nomintions-netflix-apple-amazon-191041019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">281ca81b-3d48-4f0a-918b-e9b2595db6df</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 19:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642014642</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T19:10:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment Events]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d2b5b460-73d3-11ec-adff-45e98907388b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d2b5b460-73d3-11ec-adff-45e98907388b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Noh Juhan/Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Squad from Netflix series 'Squid Game']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Squad from Netflix series 'Squid Game']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat adds bitmoji reactions and threaded replies to chats]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/snapchat"><ins>Snapchat</ins></a> is ringing in the new year with a bunch of new features.

On Wednesday, the White House said it would allocate billions toward projects that lead to the construction of more wind, solar and geothermal energy across the country.</p><p>Specifically, the administration announced it’s moving forward with the lease of six commercial areas off the coasts of New York and New Jersey for use in wind farm projects. On offer is more than 488,000 acres of ocean seafloor for the winning bidders to build an estimated 5.6 and 7 gigawatts of clean power generation. As part of the bidding process, the White House says it will incentivize participants to support labor jobs and to source turbine components from American manufacturers. The New York Bight development is one of the primary pillars of the Biden administration’s plan to build out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-off-shore-wind-plan-204820118.html">30 gigawatts of offshore wind production by 2030</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another significant facet of today’s announcement is the “Building a Better Grid” initiative. Pulling from the $65 billion Congress set aside for power grid upgrades when it passed President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a>, the initiative earmarks $2.5 billion toward funding the installation of new transmission lines. It’s putting another $3 billion toward an expansion of the Smart Grid Investment Grant Program, which supports projects that increase the capacity and flexibility of existing electrical infrastructure.</p><p>The administration notes it will also allocate $10 billion in grants to states, tribes and utility companies to help those groups strengthen their local transmission lines. Taken together, the investments will help modernize the country’s power grid, making it easier to transport renewable energy from remote generation sites to where it’s needed most. It will also harden the power grid against the kind of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-cold-snap-outage-193054181.html">extreme weather events</a> that have become more commonplace as the effects of climate change have worsened.</p><p>Today’s announcement sees the White House putting forward meaningful climate policy, but if the Biden administration is to have a chance of meeting the president’s ambitious goal of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-10/how-joe-biden-s-2035-green-energy-grid-could-work">decarbonizing the country’s power grid by 2035</a>, it will need to bypass the legislative gridlock that has left the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/">Build Better Back Framework</a> in limbo. Much of that will depend on whether the White House can convince Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia to support the approximately $1.75 trillion climate and social spending bill.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-climate-change-policy-181033816.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ee13fdb-3f9b-49e6-9407-165c9e47ee26</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 18:10:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642013684</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T18:55:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/04874080-73cf-11ec-a9de-a4bbffca008a" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/04874080-73cf-11ec-a9de-a4bbffca008a" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ZHOUSHAN, CHINA - NOVEMBER 24, 2021 - An aerial photo taken on November 24, 2021 shows wind turbines rotating under sea breeze at a wind farm in Zhoushan City, Zhejiang Province, China.

Simply put, many of the customers in 2021 were adding new PCs rather than replacing existing ones. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-laptops-for-students-130054631.html">Remote students</a> and seniors were purchasing first computers, for example, while multiple systems were &quot;more common&quot; in some areas.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/6a13f4c0-73cf-11ec-b3fd-fb0c74ee8421" style="height:1644;width:1920;" alt="PC market share in 2021" data-uuid="290964d4-208f-3e8a-bb96-accaf8fd9e57"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canalys</div></figure><p>Some PC brands had a better time than others, though. Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple and Acer held on to their respective top-five positions in shipments, but Apple and Acer were the shining stars after growing deliveries over 20 percent compared to 2020. Frontrunners Lenovo and HP had the slowest growth of the leaders in 2021, and saw their shipments fall in the very last quarter where other rivals grew. Their size didn&#39;t help them capitalize on expanded demand for computers, to put it another way.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It also seems likely that 2022 will be similarly bright. Principal Analyst Rushabh Doshi predicted the new year would be one of &quot;digital acceleration&quot; as people shift toward high-end PCs and accessories that help with remote work.

That, in turn, has led to some ImageRunner multifunction printers incorrectly <a href="https://twitter.com/ErickStarren/status/1480258812275671042">flagging</a> official cartridges as knockoffs — Canon has even told printer owners how to bypass the warnings and deal with broken toner level detection.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Canon for comment. Some users said they&#39;ve encountered similar issues with HP printers, but  that company wouldn&#39;t directly confirm or deny the problems in a statement to <em>The Register</em>. Instead, HP said it was using a &quot;globally diverse&quot; supply network to stay &quot;agile and adaptable&quot; in the midst of chip shortages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The printer trouble illustrates one of the common complaints about digital rights management (DRM) and other copy protection systems: they create trouble the moment their designers can&#39;t offer full support. Just ask people who bought music <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-04-23-microsoft-turns-the-drm-screw-on-msn-music-owners.html">tied to Microsoft&#39;s PlaysForSure</a>, for example. It&#39;s doubtful Canon, HP or others will drop their DRM chips any time soon, but this incident won&#39;t exactly help their case.</p><p><strong>Update 1/12 1:05PM ET:</strong> Canon told Engadget its focus was to &quot;limit possible disruption&quot; to customers, and that included shipping toner cartridges without the anti-knockoff chips. The company stressed there was no shortage of the cartridges themselves — American customers still had a &quot;continuous supply.&quot; You can read the full statement below.</p><blockquote><p><em>While the global shortage of semiconductor components continues to affect many industries, it’s our priority to limit possible disruption to our customers. As with all manufacturers, we continually monitor our supply chain to anticipate and prepare for any potential disruption and we are taking steps to deal with the situation, such as adjusting product designs. One example of this is in toner cartridges for some of our MFP devices (imageRUNNER/imageRUNNER ADVANCE) as we are currently facing a shortage of the chip that is fitted inside the toner cartridge to monitor its remaining toner levels. There is no shortage of toner cartridge itself – a shortage of the chip that lies inside the toner cartridge. As such, we’re now shipping toner cartridges for some of our MFP devices without this chip to ensure we’re still providing a continuous supply of consumables to our Canon U.S.A. customers. We have also issued guidance on how to install and manage these new toner cartridges.</em></p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canon-printer-ink-cartridge-false-fake-claims-161752274.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c78161c1-e036-4048-baad-e5e087115abc</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 16:17:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642010805</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T08:58:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8c0ac4b0-73ba-11ec-9fc3-f0643c874048" width="6754" height="4508" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8c0ac4b0-73ba-11ec-9fc3-f0643c874048" width="6754" height="4508" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AndreyPopov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Irritated young businesswoman looking at printer machine at office]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Irritated Businesswoman Looking At Printer Machine At Office]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2' is delayed until December 8th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fans will need to wait several more months than expected to get their hands on the latest game in the series.

It was the company’s first foray into fully customizable keyboards, and we liked it a lot. Today it’s the turn of <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q2-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard">the Q2</a>, which is a smaller (65% or no “function key”) version of the Q1. Despite the reduced footprint, it retails for the same price, starting at $149 for the barebone or $169 if you want it fully assembled – cheaper than much of the competition.</p><p>When we tested the Q1 we liked it a lot. It offered the same level of configuration as the much-loved GMMK Pro for about $100 less. That said, the selling point of the GMMK Pro (in this author’s opinion) is all about those luxurious “Lubed Panda” switches and the firm, responsive typing experience. The “Panda” is GMMK’s own “switch” which for those that don’t hang out at <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-mito-gmk-hennessey-custom-keycap-set">Drop</a> and/or use a “mech” are the mechanical part of the key – the important bit, really, as that’s mostly what will define how the keyboard “feels.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with the Q1, the Q2 is compatible with <a href="https://caniusevia.com/">VIA</a> configuration software (and thus QMK) which easily allows you to remap keys to almost anything, create macros and more. Also like the Q1 (and the <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black">GMMK Pro</a> and increasingly others) there’s the option to replace the top-right-most key (Insert) with a clickable rotary for volume and media control.</p><p>I’ll admit, after using the GMMK Pro for a while now, I find the Gateron Reds that came with the Q2 a little flacid by comparison, but that’s the joy of a customizable keyboard, you can use whatever switches you like (or change out more or less any other part). You could even load it with the Pandas if you wish, though that would require a (lot of) extra spend.</p><p>The Q2 remains USB only (no wireless) but is still compatible with either Windows or Mac and the corresponding OS-specific keycaps are included in the box. It’s also just as rugged and well built as the Q1 with the all-metal casing. You can choose between three colors thereof: Black, gray and navy blue.</p><p>Ultimately, the selling point of the Q2 boils down to whether you prefer a compact keyboard or to have access to physical function keys (they’re still accessible here with shortcuts obviously).</p><p>The Q2 is also joined by some other relatively new additions. Keychron is prolific if nothing else. In particular, there’s the lightweight/70% <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k14-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">K14 </a>which is both wireless and has hot-swappable switches for a more affordable on-the-go option that retails for a modest $59. The company also recently unveiled its first mouse wired <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-m1-mouse">the M1</a>. It’s visually quite similar to the Razer Viper ($39) but also bears more than a passing resemblance to the <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-model-o-black">Glorious O</a> (also from the same people behind the GMMK Pro).</p><p>Orders for the Keychron Q2 are open as of today.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/keychron-q-2-keyboard-140003464.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cdfdfd04-ee7e-4544-87b2-611172ba453f</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642017493</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T19:58:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b84d1530-72d6-11ec-b6ea-a0371615ed38" width="2000" height="1260" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b84d1530-72d6-11ec-b6ea-a0371615ed38" width="2000" height="1260" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Keychron Q2 fully customizable keybord.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Keychron Q2 ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Connected dumbbells that  Amazon's Alexa can adjust]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WFH didn’t just mean working from home.
