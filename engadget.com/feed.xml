Anyone with an LG set running webOS 5.0 or 6.0 (that is, 2020 or newer) can use the cloud gaming service to play <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed</em> or <em>Madden</em> without requiring a media device or PC as a go-between. You&#39;ll need a compatible gamepad, but that shouldn&#39;t be an issue when the Stadia Controller and common console pads should work either wirelessly or through USB.</p><p>Not surprisingly, LG suggests one of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-g1-series-oled-tvs-ces-2021-133053674.html">OLED TVs</a> for Stadia thanks to the fast pixel response times, low latency and (for Stadia Pro subscribers) 4K HDR visuals. They&#39;re certainly not required, though, and it&#39;s arguably the lag from game streaming that will make the larger difference.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Stadia is available through the LG Content Store in all 22 countries where the service already exists. You probably won&#39;t buy a TV with Stadia in mind, but this significantly widens the number of sets where native support is an option — you might be more inclined to try it if the barrier to entry is that much lower.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-lg-smart-tv-release-date-152718368.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">64752abf-fae3-4f24-b1b0-f52414eb4087</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 15:27:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638976469</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T15:14:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/786150b0-5834-11ec-befe-fc6ff23c8f2b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/786150b0-5834-11ec-befe-fc6ff23c8f2b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Stadia on LG Smart TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Stadia on LG Smart TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Polestar will increase its EV's horsepower with a €1,000 software update]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/polestar/"><ins>Polestar</ins></a> has <a href="https://media.polestar.com/global/en/media/pressreleases/642344"><ins>released</ins></a> an over-the-air update that boosts the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-ev-drive-video-133035906.html"><ins>Polestar 2&#39;s</ins></a> torque and horsepower.

The feature is part of Facebook parent Meta&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html">$1 billion investment</a> in creators that includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creators-challenges-affiliate-commission-193917455.html">bonuses</a> for Instagram influencers and an expansion to the Stars program <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114137082634871">announced yesterday</a> by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest feature of professional mode profiles is the addition of the Reels Play <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/programs/bonuses">bonus program</a> that allows creators to earn up to $35,000 a month based on views of qualifying reels (videos). Previously, that program was only open to users with Pages. It&#39;ll be invitation-only for professional profiles to start with, with more information about how to create reels <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/reels-for-facebook">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of Reels, Facebook is planning to add the ability to create longer, 60 second reels, save drafts mid-creation and create compositions from multiple clips. Those features are coming &quot;soon&quot; and it&#39;s planning to expand Reels to more countries next year, too. Professional Mode also lets profiles see the same kind of post and audience analytics data that Page users get, including shares, reactions and comments. You can also see your follower growth over time.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s a caveat that, not surprisingly, involves privacy. Once you turn on professional mode, &quot;anyone can follow you and see your public content in their feed,&quot; Facebook said. However, you&#39;ll still be able to limit specific posts or updates to friends only.</p><p>Facebook is playing catchup to rival platforms with the creator community, particularly TikTok, which recently passed 3 billion downloads and is ahead of Facebook in user engagement. On top of the new profiles, it recently introduced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/facebooks-new-website-lets-fans-buy-stars-without-paying-the-app-stores-commissions/">Stars store website</a> that lets creators earn cash from followers without paying app store commissions. Professional mode is testing with a limited number of profiles today in the US, but will be expanded to more people in the US &quot;soon&quot; and more countries in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-introduces-a-new-professional-mode-for-creators-140006876.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd9bdd0f-4477-4363-b683-aa4a167dc39a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 14:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638967259</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T12:41:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b5987980-581c-11ec-adff-c9a7048a056a" width="2000" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b5987980-581c-11ec-adff-c9a7048a056a" width="2000" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook's 'professional mode' lets creators monetize without a separate Page]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook's 'professional mode' lets creators monetize without a separate Page]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[8Bitdo's SN30 Pro+ controller drops to $40 for today only]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>8Bitdo controllers have been some of our favorites thanks to their charming designs and affordable prices. We called one of the latest, the SN30 Pro+, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-8bitdo-sn30-pro-plus-controller-impressions.html">near-perfect Nintendo Switch controller</a> and now you can get that accessory at its best price yet. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sn30 Pro+" href="https://amzn.to/31wILjS">SN30 Pro+</a> is down to $40 today as a Lightning Deal on Amazon, which means you have roughly six hours from the time of writing this to grab it before the price goes back up to $50. This is the same deal we saw on Black Friday, so if you missed it then, you have another opportunity to get it today.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/31wILjS" id="4b9c6ef95ef44a09a0444cff60c0d9a3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 8Bitdo SN30 Pro+ at Amazon - $40</a><p>The SN30 Pro+ will look familiar to those who loved the SNES. It has a similar design to that console&#39;s controller with a D-pad, circular A, B, X and Y buttons and start and select buttons in the middle. But it also has handles for better ergonomics, along with analog sticks and two more buttons. It&#39;s well-built and lightweight, making it easy to throw into a bag and take with you when you want to play with your Switch on the go. While plenty of people will want to use it with Nintendo&#39;s console, the SN30 Pro+ is also compatible with PC, macOS, Android, Steam and Raspberry Pi.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not only did we find the SN30 Pro+ to be even more comfortable than Nintendo&#39;s own Switch Pro Controller, it also has the added benefit of a removable battery pack. It&#39;ll last about 20 hours on a single charge, but in a pinch, you can take out that pack and replace it with AA batteries instead.

It&#39;s no secret that Apple hasn&#39;t been immune to the global supply chain shortages despite its enormous purchasing power. The tech giant previously lowered its iPhone 13 production goals for the year and had to cut back on the iPad&#39;s production to allocate more parts for its mobile flagship devices. But this is reportedly the first time in a decade that the company had to cease operations at its factories during China&#39;s Golden Week.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple factories typically ramp up production during the Chinese holidays that take place at the beginning of October, running 24 hour shifts so that it can keep up with holiday shopping demands. This year, though, it reportedly gave its workers some time off instead. A supply chain manager told the publication that it made no sense to pay workers overtime for working during the holidays when there were very limited component and chips to work with. As a result, people who may be thinking of getting a new iPad or a new iPhone as a Christmas gift for loved ones or themselves may not get it in time for the season.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Nikkei Asia</em> says that supply chain issues started way before the pandemic, when Chinese companies blacklisted by the United States hoarded inventories to survive crackdowns. That said, the COVID-19 lockdowns implemented in Malaysia and Vietnam due to the Delta variant heavily affected the production of numerous electrical components and chips.&nbsp;</p><p>In many cases, bottlenecks weren&#39;t caused by the lack of a device&#39;s most expensive components, but its cheaper peripheral parts. Component manufacturers that don&#39;t have as much purchasing power as tech giants fall to the back of the list when it comes to raw materials, after all. For the iPhone 13 Max, for instance, tiny peripherals that only cost a few cents each are what&#39;s causing the delay.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple chief Tim Cook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/apple-aapl-q4-2021-earnings.html">previously said</a> that the company lost $6 billion for the quarter ending in September due to supply chain constraints, and that he believes that it could lose more in the final quarter of the year. It still remains to be seen if Apple would still enjoy the same level of demand by the time it has the components to manufacture its devices. <em>Nikkei Asia</em> says Apple told suppliers that demand persists for the iPhone 13 and to reaccelerate their component production for November, December and January. According to a previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-warned-suppliers-slowing-demand-iphones-070948347.html"><em>Bloomberg report</em></a>, though, Apple warned suppliers that demand for its biggest revenue source has already weakened just before the holidays.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-forced-to-halt-iphone-ipad-assembly-131714897.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e8fd40c-67ed-4bef-9f0d-b1f6dbb935ac</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 13:17:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638969623</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T13:20:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9f506060-5822-11ec-bf5b-acf849375663" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9f506060-5822-11ec-bf5b-acf849375663" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The Hubble telescope wakes up from 'hibernation']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#39;s Hubble telescope has been in a month-long nap since going into system failure in late October. However, early yesterday, the agency announced it is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-hubble-telescope-is-operational-again-155710162.html">waking Hubble up</a>. NASA says the telescope is now functioning as normal, with all four active instruments collecting data.</p><p>On October 23rd, NASA first noticed Hubble&#39;s instruments weren&#39;t receiving messages from the telescope&#39;s control unit. NASA ended up putting the telescope into a sort of safe mode while it tried to figure out what happened. That safe mode takes a long time to come out of because of the sensitivity of Hubble&#39;s hardware. Rapid power or temperature changes aren&#39;t good for its lifespan. The telescope is now 31 years old — Hubble may be nearing the end of its useful life in space. NASA will use the telescope till the end, though, planning to use it in tandem with the Webb telescope, which is expected to finally launch on December 22nd.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-premium-memberships-announcement-160019679.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Discord gives server owners the tools to put channels behind a paywall</a></h2><h3>The company is testing Premium Memberships with a small group of users.</h3><h3></h3><p>Discord has started testing a feature called Premium Memberships.

Marvel movies were as popular as ever, with <em>Eternals</em> holding the top spot for trending films, followed by <em>Black Widow</em>. <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em> are also in the list, along with other hits for the year, such as <em>Dune</em> and <em>Red Notice</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Squid Game</em> captured the attention of people everywhere, and it&#39;s joined by <em>Bridgerton</em>, <em>WandaVision</em>, <em>Cobra Kai</em> and <em>Loki</em> in the top trending TV shows list.

Verizon (Engadget<em>&#39;s</em> former parent company) collected users&#39; location, web browsing and mobile application usage data to send them marketing messages or offers under Selects, though subscribers could opt out if they wanted to. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/verizon-ignored-users-previous-opt-outs-in-latest-push-to-scan-web-browsing/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> notes, the carrier recently replaced its Selects program with the Verizon Custom Experience Plus and Custom Experience programs.

The carrier also wrote that it keeps browsing information for no more than 6 months. It keeps location and phone number information for approximately one year.&nbsp;</p><p>To remove themselves from the program, users will have to opt out again. While we&#39;re sure a lot of subscribers wouldn&#39;t appreciate being enrolled into marketing programs they previously chose not to participate in, it&#39;s at least easy to unsubscribe.

The organization recently conducted an investigation where it created a series of fake accounts to test the safeguards Instagram has in place to protect young people from potentially deadly pharmaceuticals.</p><p>While hashtags like #mdma are banned on the platform, TTP found it was easy to skirt those restrictions with an account tied to a minor. Using MDMA as an example, the organization found it could employ terms like “mdmamolly” to find people who were selling the substance. In fact, the app’s search algorithm made it easy to find those hashtags, with its autocomplete feature pointing researchers in the right direction.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make matters worse, once someone follows even just one account belonging to an alleged drug dealer, Instagram’s recommendation algorithm will suggest the user follow similar profiles. Despite Instagram&#39;s <a href="https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119"><ins>Community Guidelines</ins></a> prohibiting “buying or selling non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs,” TTP found many drug dealers operate openly on the platform.</p><p>Separately, TTP says Instagram did not take decisive action against the content it found on the platform. The organization claims it submitted 50 posts to the company for review. Of those, Instagram said 36 (or 72 percent) did not violate its Community Guidelines, despite what TTP says were “clear signs” of drug dealing activity. At the time of publishing, the company had only banned one account flagged by TTP. However, when the organization went to check on that profile, it was still up on Instagram along with all of its violating content.</p><p>“We prohibit drug sales on Instagram. We removed 1.8 million pieces of content related to drug sales in the last quarter alone, and due to our improving detection technology, the prevalence of such content is about 0.05 percent of content viewed, or about 5 views per every 10,000,” Stephanie Otway, a spokesperson for Meta, told Engadget. “We’ll continue to improve in this area in our ongoing efforts to keep Instagram safe, particularly for our youngest community members.”</p><p>The report comes just one day before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-adam-mosseri-congress-testify-184609082.html"><ins>Adam Mosseri</ins></a> is slated to testify to the Senate about Instagram’s impact on young users.

According to Google, Glupteba’s operators used the malware to steal personal data, mine cryptocurrencies and funnel other internet traffic through the infected machines.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/07/google-glupteba-botnet-hack/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, the hackers also used some of Google’s own services to distribute the malware. The company suspended more than 1,000 accounts that had been used to spread Glupteba.</p><p>“We don’t just plug security holes, we work to eliminate entire classes of threats for consumers and businesses whose work depends on the Internet,” the company said. “We have teams of analysts and security experts who are dedicated to identifying and stopping issues like DDoS, phishing campaigns, zero-day vulnerabilities, and hacking against Google, our products, and our users.”</p><p>Google coordinated with internet infrastructure providers to disrupt the botnet, but warns it has so far only succeeded in stopping it temporarily. Glupteba uses blockchain technology as a failsafe against a complete shutdown. When it doesn’t hear from its owners, the software is programmed to automatically use data encoded on the Bitcoin blockchain for instructions on how to reconnect.</p><p>“Unfortunately, Glupteba’s use of blockchain technology as a resiliency mechanism is notable here and is becoming a more common practice among cyber crime organizations,” Google said. “The decentralized nature of blockchain allows the botnet to recover more quickly from disruptions, making them that much harder to shutdown.” The company says it’s working with its partners to make the internet more resilient to such attacks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-disrupts-glupteba-botnet-202342050.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">257af264-77f4-4590-bb71-2ff6a9aadd9d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:23:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638908628</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T20:24:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Internet & Networking Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/0e7b3510-16a2-11ea-bbfe-5fc9911d4886" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/0e7b3510-16a2-11ea-bbfe-5fc9911d4886" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JHVEPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mountain View, California, USA - March 28, 2018: Google sign at Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley.

The <a href="https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/">Hydrasynth</a> is an unabashedly digital instrument with an impressive collection of sound design tools and a proprietary keyboard that has polyphonic aftertouch. For those looking to leave behind the warm but staid world of analog for the complex frontiers of digital, it’s pretty alluring. But, while its $1,299 list price isn’t absurd given the feature set, it’s also out range for many hobbyists. Even the desktop model, which ditches the keyboard in favor of 24 pads, is slightly pricey at $799.</p><p>The new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Hydrasynth Explorer" href="https://fave.co/332xGHn">Hydrasynth Explorer</a>, however, is expressly designed to get ASM’s keyboard and synth engine in the hands of as many people as possible. And it’s “portable” to boot. (Although, as I’ll get to later, the company’s definition of portable is highly questionable.) Of course to reach the more attainable price of $599, some things had to be sacrificed. But the good news is, most of what’s missing amounts to minor conveniences.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before we go any further, let’s set some expectations: I cannot possibly cover every feature of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asm-hydrasynth-explorer-superbooth-wavemorphing-portable-191358134.html">Hydrasynth Explorer</a> in detail. Even the 88-page manual feels like it’s just skimming the surface. If you’re looking for an exhaustive walkthrough, I highly recommend Loopop’s nearly hour-long tutorial on the original <a href="https://youtu.be/-rJd_j9_Ixs">Hydrasynths</a> and its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfuTU1hdMV4">half-hour long follow-up</a> looking at what’s different on the Explorer and Deluxe.</p><p>The most important thing you need to know is that the core of the Hydrasynth — its wavemorphing engine — remains unchanged and it&#39;s running on the same hardware. So the Explorer still has eight-note polyphony, with three oscillators per voice, and over 200 waveforms to choose from. The first two oscillators can be static or in “wavescan” mode, which simply means you can choose up to eight waveforms at a time to morph between. While you can’t import your own custom wavetables, you can essentially build your own from the pre-approved ingredients.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882eb493-5782-11ec-a4fe-eb5d1ebaf4f6" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="2f77867c-9d36-385a-b11e-c33b0c77d2d2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Those oscillators can be combined and manipulated using what ASM calls Mutators — two each for oscillators one and two. There are eight different Mutators to choose from, ranging from classic FM (frequency modulation) and hard sync, to the slightly more exotic PhazDiff, and even three different flavors of pulse width modulation.</p><p>The third oscillator is a much simpler affair. It’s a static wave and it can’t be sent through a Mutator, but it can still add depth to a sound. The most obvious use is as a sub-oscillator to add a little bass, but it can also be fed through the ring modulator. Which, by the way: Yes, there is a ring modulator and a noise source as well.</p><p>There are also two filters, which can be in series or parallel, and you can control how much of each oscillator goes to which filter. The first filter has 16 different modes, ranging from classic 12db low pass to a speech-like vowel filter, while the second sweep from low pass, through bandpass or notch, and into high pass.</p><div id="undefined"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1173556741%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-2DxwFFku5Fu&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size:10px;color:#cccccc;overflow:hidden;white-space:nowrap;font-family:Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-weight:100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast" title="Engadget" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Engadget</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast/hydrasynth-explorer-sound-samples/s-2DxwFFku5Fu" title="Hydrasynth Explorer sound samples" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Hydrasynth Explorer sound samples</a></div></div><p>To control all these various parts, you’ve got five six-stage envelopes and five LFOs that all feed into a 32-slot modulation matrix. In total there are 29 modulation sources and 155 destinations. It’s a lot of variables to contend with. Frankly, it can feel overwhelming, and that’s even before you start digging into the effects and voice options like “density.”</p><p>The good news is, to get started with the Hydrasynth you don’t need to master its sound design tools, you can just dig into the presets. The stock sounds are pretty solid and cover a wide range of styles, though it does especially excel at icy ambience, strings and plucky keys. But even navigating those can be daunting, especially as some of them start to sound indistinguishable. There’s a grand total of 640 presets spread over five banks of 128 patches. Scrolling through them one by one with the large patch knob can get tedious. But if you turn your attention to the small OLED to the right of the “Main Systems” section, you can use the encoders there to filter presets by category, such as brass, ambient or e-piano. There’s also a favorites menu, where you bookmark 32 of your most used patches.</p><section data-eng-breakout="23555ad0c11b45bb82127fd3a9d71424" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/88301420-5782-11ec-af5e-e23f58862d8b" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer"></section><p><em>(I do want to briefly pause here, to nitpick about the layout of the Hydrasynth Explorer, especially because this isn’t an issue on other models. The Keyboard, Desktop and Deluxe versions all have their displays in a single line. But the Explorer has them staggered, with the navigation display being below and to the left of the parameter display on the right. The right display is significantly smaller and more cramped on the Explorer, but that’s less of an issue than the alignment, which means your eyes have to move much further when going back and forth. It’s doubly frustrating since the solution is simple: move the large patch knob from above the left display, to below it. This would have the added benefit of making it easier to see the left OLED when browsing patches since your hand wouldn’t be blocking it.)</em></p><p>Now, while there’s absolutely nothing wrong with playing presets (I am mostly a tweak-a-preset guy myself), you would be underutilizing the Hydrasynth if you didn’t explore its depths. And while it’s an incredibly complex instrument no matter how you slice it, ASM deserves credit for making the interface as clear and intuitive as possible. The Hydrasynth is far from being knob-per-function, but a lot of work was done to minimize menu diving.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/88303b30-5782-11ec-bf91-76292281c3d5" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="df47fffa-25b5-33fc-af4d-19a330d7d7bb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The front panel is divided up into neatly labeled sections: arpeggiator, filer controls, main systems, master controls and module select. In each of these sections are easy-to-read buttons, often with just one function, plus some knobs. And, by the way, all of those buttons and knobs are a delight to use. This is an incredibly well made instrument and while some sacrifices were made to reach the $599 price, build quality was not one of them.</p><p>You’ll spend most of your time at the bottom of the Master Control and Module Select section where there are 26 buttons for the various parts of the signal chain. The leftmost buttons are where you select which oscillator to modify. When you press the OSC 1 button, the right screen brings up the options for that module and you change the parameters with the endless encoders at the four corners of the display. The up and down arrows to the right scroll through the pages of settings.</p><p>For the oscillators, there are only two pages and you’ll only really need to venture to the second one in Wavescan mode. That’s where you’ll find the “wavelist edit” option. Press that and you’ll open the menu to select the sounds for your wavetable. All you do is turn the knobs next to each parameter for Wav 1, Wav 2, etcetera until you’re happy with your selection. You can pick up to eight, but you’re not required to. What makes the Hydrasynth somewhat unique is that you’re not just picking a set of static wave shapes to switch between, but as you change the position of the Wavescan it will morph from to the other seamlessly.  Which means if you move through those eight shapes slowly, you can get a lot of movement out of just a single oscillator.</p><p>To set the sound for the second and third oscillators, the process is the same.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c6a77f9b15684354a8afb6470785ab8a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882e3f60-5782-11ec-b7d7-fa52d1ff5116" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer"></section><p>As you move from left to right in the signal chain you’ll next encounter the Mutant 1-4 buttons. Press one and the OLED on the right brings up the parameters. (Noticing a trend?) Depending on what Mutator you select using the top left encoder you’ll see different options here to control. But at its most basic, you just turn one knob to choose, say PWM, then another set the wet/dry value you want.</p><p>There are eight different Mutators to choose from, but I want to focus briefly on PW-ASM, or Pulse Width ASM. There are two things that make pulse width modulation special on the Hydrasynth. One, you can use it on any waveshape — usually PWM is associated with square waves. And two: in ASM mode you can create your own custom pulse width patterns. PW-ASM breaks a wave into eight distinct sections and you dial in the amount of modulation around each of the slice points. It’s not exactly the easiest thing to explain, but suffice to say I don’t know of any other synths out there with this feature. (If you do, please tell me in the comments.)</p><p>Under the Mutants is the button to bring up the ring modulation and noise parameters, and then as you follow the line illustrating the signal chain to the right, you see they all feed into the mixer. Here you can dial in the volume of each oscillator, the ring mod and noise section, as well as panning for each. And this is also where you’ll decide how much of each to send to which filter and whether the filters are in series or parallel. This is one of the sections with the most pages of options to scroll through, but it’s still straightforward. Just press the up and down buttons next to the display until you see the parameter you want, then turn the knob next to it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882f02b0-5782-11ec-affb-9ac63e93fb92" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="da117142-d6b9-3f9a-8050-f8af73880a2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>After the mixer, you’ll see the signal chain branches off again with your envelopes (ENV) along the top, LFOs along the bottom and down the middle your audio signal, including filters, amp and effects.</p><p>By default ENV 1 and LFO 1 are connected to the filters, while ENV 2 and LFO 2 are connected to the amp. There’s no way to break the connection between ENV 2 and the amp, it will <em>always</em> define the total volume of your sound. That doesn’t mean you can’t control the volume of the oscillators separately; it just means you have to get creative.</p><p>So if you wanted OSC 2 to come in slightly after OSC 1 you could use ENV 3 to control it, just with a slightly longer attack time than ENV 2. To make the connection you could press the mod matrix button at the top and scroll through all the options. But the easier way is to hold the ENV 3 button, then press the mixer button. Then those two modules will be automatically connected and all you have to do is pick the parameter you want (OSC2CVol in this case) and dial in the depth. It’s also worth mentioning that the Hydrasynth’s envelopes have six stages — delay, attack, hold, decay, sustain and release — as opposed to the more common ADSR. That means you can actually delay the start of the envelope for a certain amount of time after a key press.</p><p>Even more interesting are the LFOs. While you can use them to create whooshing filter sounds and gentle pitch warbles, you can also use them as a sequencer. Step mode lets you create a customized modulation pattern of up to 64 steps.</p><p>On the fourth page of the LFO settings, though, you’ll find the SemiLock option — this is where the magic happens. See, Hydrasynth doesn’t have a proper sequencer, but you can use the LFOs locked to semitones thanks to the latest firmware. So, with fairly minimal work, OSC 2 could come in behind OSC 1 and play melody over a pad. This is just one example of how to use this power. You can sequence anything from filter cutoff to the wet/dry mix on the reverb to the detune or glide time, or even the parameters of the Mutators. This level of control opens a whole world of possibilities.</p><p>At the end of the signal chain you have four effects slots to work with: one pre-fx, one post-fx and sandwiched between them are dedicated delay and reverb modules. There are a few different varieties of the latter two. The reverse delay is excellent, and while the plate and hall reverbs are solid, cloud is my favorite setting.</p><p>The post- and pre-fx sections have the same options to choose from, including phaser, distortion, compression, rotary, tremolo and more. But my favorite to stick at the end of almost every patch is Lo-Fi. You can turn down the sample rate to get some crushed digital sounds and there are various filter types to choose from that give you the quality of something being played through a phone or over a radio. It’s just a nice touch to keep everything from getting too crisp and clean.</p><p>Here’s the thing: This is only just scratching the surface of what the Hydrasynth is capable of. There are a number of options in the Voice menu for adding depth and warmth, like the sort of vague Analog Feel. There’s an incredibly capable arpeggiator with eight different modes. There’s a macro section where you can assign multiple parameters to a single knob to dramatically transform sounds in a performance-friendly way. And I barely even mentioned the keyboard which has polyphonic aftertouch — something basically unheard of at this price point.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882eb494-5782-11ec-a6fd-aecd6921d416" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="01513a55-07dc-3a1a-8045-8becf659a74a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Hydrasynth Explorer, at least under the hood, is virtually indistinguishable from it’s larger counterpart the Hydrasynth Keys, which costs almost twice as much. So what are you giving up here? Well, one the Explorer has mini keys instead of full-sized ones, but that might not be a con for some people like myself with small hands and limited piano skills. There’s also no proper pitch and mod wheels, instead you get touchstrips; they’re fine, but not nearly as accurate. The biggest loss is the reduced number of controls. The filter knobs have been reduced from five to three, and there’s only four macro / parameter knobs, versus eight on the larger models. But honestly, these are minor sacrifices to reach this price.</p><p>The one last thing to address is that ASM calls the Hydrasynth Explorer “portable,” but that’s only true in the most technical of senses. In addition to the included AC adapter you can power it with eight AA batteries — which is not a trivial amount — for three to four hours. Plus, the Explorer weighs 7.5 pounds and it’s nearly 22 inches long. Sure, that’s petite compared to the 22 pounds and 32 inches of the Hydrasynth Keys, but this is not something that you’re gonna toss in a backpack and bring to the park on a whim. While it’s easy enough to toss in the trunk and bring to a jam session, that ASM doesn’t include or sell a travel case for it, kind of undermines the portability pitch.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c0c7110991a54cc19f0c9b64be0d4a8f" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882eb491-5782-11ec-bcec-2c91fbe5922b" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer"></section><p>So no, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Explorer" href="https://fave.co/332xGHn">Explorer</a> isn’t really what I’d call “portable,” but that doesn’t matter. Even if this thing never left your studio it would be worth the money. It sounds great (as long as you can accept that it sounds obviously digital), it’s solidly built, and it has an almost bottomless set of sound design tools to explore. It’s possible to just get lost building patches on the Hydrasynth — and not in an annoying menu-diving way. If you’ve got the money, the larger Keys with more hands-on controls will almost certainly save you some headaches, but the Hydrasynth Explorer might be the most synth you can get for under $600.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hydrasynth-explorer-review-wavetable-synthesis-183026724.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">286605bb-3572-434a-b39e-f31ce64fc430</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 18:30:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638913870</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T21:51:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/882eb491-5782-11ec-bcec-2c91fbe5922b" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/88308951-5782-11ec-abf4-d18bc8813c29" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hydrasynth Explorer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hydrasynth Explorer]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
