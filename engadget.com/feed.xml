The latest complaint, which was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/22/facebook-new-whistleblower-complaint/"><ins>first reported</ins></a> by <em>The Washington Post</em>, alleges Facebook misled its investors about “dangerous and criminal behavior on its platforms, including Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger.”</p><p>In the complaint, the former employee described a conversation with one of Facebook’s top communication executives who, following disclosures about Russia’s use of the platform to meddle in the 2016 election, said the scandal would be a “flash in the pan” and that “we are printing money in the basement, and we are fine.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html">Frances Haugen</a>, the latest whistleblower is also a former member of Facebook’s integrity team, which was tasked with fighting misinformation, voting interference and other major problems facing the company. And, like Haugen, the former Facebook staffer said that the company has “routinely undermined efforts to fight misinformation, hate speech and other problematic content out of fear of angering then-President Trump and his political allies, or out of concern about potentially dampening the user growth.”</p><p>The SEC filing also describes illegal activity in secret Facebook Groups, and Facebook’s policy of allowing politicians and other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebooks-oversight-board-said-the-company-failed-to-provide-relevant-information-132603146.html">high-profile users</a> to skirt its rules. It names Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg as being aware of the problems and not reporting them to investors, according to <em>The Post</em>.</p><p>While many of the details sound similar to other complaints from former company insiders, news of another complaint adds to the pressure on Facebook, which has spent much of the last month trying to discredit Haugen and downplay the significance of its own research. Meanwhile, lawmakers have called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senator-blumenthal-says-zuckerberg-needs-to-testify-about-instagram-and-kids-194805814.html">on Zuckerberg</a> to answer questions from Congress, and Haugen is expected to brief European officials as well.</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Zuckerberg is expected to announce plans to rebrand the company with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reportedly-changing-name-042958266.html">a new name</a> next week.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/another-former-facebook-employee-has-become-a-whistleblower-195851118.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea941dd5-6037-4692-9c8c-8195e3037b26</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 19:58:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634932890</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T20:01:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41752c60-336e-11ec-bcd5-b70ec5b4eeb2" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41752c60-336e-11ec-bcd5-b70ec5b4eeb2" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 23: Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill October 23, 2019 in Washington, DC.

The Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC) <a href="https://sfconservancy.org/blog/2021/oct/21/trump-groups-violates-affero-gpl/">says</a> The Trump Media and Technology Group (TMTG) violated a licensing agreement when it recently launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-social-network-defaced-124507041.html"><ins>test version of TRUTH Social</ins></a>. The website ran on a modified version of <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/"><ins>Mastodon</ins></a>, a free and open-source platform for operating Twitter-like social media networks. Anyone can use Mastodon provided they comply with <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html">AGPLv3</a>, the software license that governs its code.</p><p>One of the central provisions of AGPLv3 is that licensees must share their source code with all users. In the short time a test version of TRUTH Social was up earlier today, it did not do that. Now, the Software Freedom Conservancy, an organization that enforces open source software licenses, says TMTG has 30 days to comply with AGPLv3 or face the consequences.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The license purposefully treats everyone equally (even people we don’t like or agree with), but they must operate under the same rules of the copyleft licenses that apply to everyone else,” SFC said in a blog post.</p><p>It says the company must “immediately” make TRUTH Social’s source code available to everyone who accessed the site earlier in the day. If TMTG fails to do so in 30 days, it will permanently lose access to the software it used to build its platform. “That’s how AGPLv3’s cure provision works — no exceptions — even if you’re a real estate mogul, reality television star, or even a former POTUS,” the SFC said. If TMTG doesn’t comply with the request, it could face a lawsuit. “We will be following this issue very closely and demanding that Trump’s Group give the corresponding source to all who use the site,” SFC said.</p><p>In closing, SFC shared details about how TRUTH Social was defaced earlier in the day. It says it found no evidence anyone “illegally broke” into the website. Instead, it notes the episode was the result of an improper configuration. “Once discovered, people merely used the site legitimately to register accounts and use its features,” the organization said.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/trump-truth-social-software-license-violation-185629984.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b11f441a-15ea-4400-ab27-a4b5e8fb23b8</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 18:56:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634928992</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T18:56:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/22320b60-332e-11ec-bdcc-97b6e0802ed9" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/22320b60-332e-11ec-bdcc-97b6e0802ed9" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TRUTH Social]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TRUTH Social]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TRUTH Social]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple TV+ renews 'Mythic Quest' for seasons three and four]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fans of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mythic%20quest/"><em><ins>Mythic Quest</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>have much more of the show to look forward to. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple%20tv/"><ins>Apple TV+</ins></a> has renewed the series for seasons three and four.

There weren&#39;t any enormous spaceships ready to rocket off to planets in distant galaxies. No Brutalist palaces amid endless desert vistas. No building-sized sandworms roaming about, eager to devour anyone who disturbed them. Just me and traffic on Atlanta&#39;s I-285.</p><p>This latest <em>Dune </em>adaptation isn&#39;t perfect — it&#39;s at times emotionally empty, and it&#39;s basically set up for a second movie we may never see — but it successfully transported me to the universe Frank Herbert created over half a century ago. The film focuses on half of the novel, telling the story of Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet), a sheltered baron&#39;s son who moves to the desert planet of Arrakis. It&#39;s an important post, since it&#39;s the only world that produces the melange, or spice, which powers interstellar travel. But as Paul quickly learns, it&#39;s also a dangerous place for his elite family, and it&#39;s where he learns he may also be a potential messiah. You know, typical teen boy stuff.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb651e0-335a-11ec-9ffd-282aebcb8788" alt="Dune" data-uuid="fdc40a1d-4113-360b-b387-2b5e053f6bbe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures</div></figure><p>After being wowed by <em>Dune</em> in the theater, I plan to rewatch it at home on HBO Max, where it&#39;s also being released today. But I&#39;m certain the experience won&#39;t be the same, even on my 120-inch projector screen. This <em>Dune</em> demands to be seen on something even bigger—a place where your very sense of being can be dwarfed. <em>Dune</em> made me feel like Paul Atreides standing in front of a skyscraper-sized sandworm, waiting to be consumed. And I welcomed it.</p><p>Of course, it&#39;s no simple thing to trek out to the cinema these days, not with coronavirus still raging and fellow theatergoers refusing to take basic safety precautions. (The vaccines are safe. Masks work. Please protect yourself and others.) But if you can manage to safely see it in theaters — perhaps by renting out a private screen with friends — you&#39;ll be reminded of what makes that experience so special. I watched it in the second row of a fairly typical multiplex theater, and it still floored me. I can only imagine what it would be like on a full-sized IMAX screen, which can reach up to 98 feet tall.</p><div id="e3552a2868264a6b8244b7d5cca0e857"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w0HgHet0sxg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Dune</em> is at its best when Villeneuve and cinematographer Greig Fraser let you soak in the vistas, the regal-yet-alien costumes and the wealth of background details. It&#39;s pure visual world-building. At one point, a character&#39;s eyes briefly flash white when he&#39;s asked to compute the cost of an imperial envoy&#39;s trek through the stars. It&#39;s never explained, but <em>you get it</em>. This style of slow burn sci-fi isn&#39;t for everyone, but if you enjoyed <em>Arrival</em> or <em>Blade Runner 2049</em>, Villeneuve&#39;s previous genre forays, there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;re primed for this brand of storytelling.</p><p>Even before I saw anything on the screen, though, I felt <em>Dune</em> in my gut. As I waited for my screening to begin, an alien voice began speaking out of nowhere, sounding like it came entirely from the theater&#39;s subwoofers. It posed a question about the power of dreams, but really, it was as if the movie was saying, &quot;Sit up, pay attention, you&#39;re not on Earth anymore.&quot;</p><section data-eng-breakout="4341db2ce314418cab560b07cc9b1bf0" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb651e1-335a-11ec-be77-a230d7617e2c" alt="Dune"></section><p>The film&#39;s inventive sound design doesn&#39;t stop there. Everything you hear — from the roar of spaceships as they take off, the buzz of dragonfly-like vehicles as they flap their wings, or the sphincter-clenching roar of the sandworms — is meticulously crafted to make you believe it&#39;s all real. Hans Zimmer&#39;s score doesn&#39;t tread too far from his <em>Gladiator </em>vibe, but does a fine job of making everything sound epic. (And yes, I was blasting it down the highway as I sped back home.)</p><p>Don&#39;t take my praise for this movie as disrespect towards David Lynch&#39;s 1984 <em>Dune. </em>That was a troubled production that&#39;s since attained cult status, but it was hampered by meddling producers and a script that tried to cram in the entire novel. Villenueve&#39;s approach is more confident and, as you&#39;d expect, is backed by far more capable visual effects technology. Even though it runs for two hours and 35 minutes, I could have easily given up another three hours to watch the rest of the story.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb6a001-335a-11ec-bd6b-51bf9f6ffe98" alt="Dune" data-uuid="a60b1100-ad0e-372e-b895-6c623594a3a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, there&#39;s a chance we won&#39;t see that conclusion. Warner Bros. originally agreed to let Villeneuve tell the story in two parts (this movie&#39;s title card says &quot;<em>Dune Part 1&quot;), but </em>the follow-up still hasn&#39;t been officially greenlit. The <a href="https://variety.com/video/dune-denis-villeneuve-part-two-rebecca-ferguson/#recipient_hashed=ca6bf125ba1d9e0643825bb798806510a6792220ab8ce995c97069e04442b39b">director told <em>Variety</em></a> that his plan to shoot both parts at once was denied—he expects to hear more from the studio once we see how <em>Dune </em>performs in theaters and on HBO Max. Plans for a prequel TV series, <em>Dune: The Sisterhood</em>, are still in the works with Villeneuve attached to produce.</p><p>As epic as <em>Dune</em> is, it&#39;s a shame that its scope couldn&#39;t fit in actors from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), cultures that Herbert was clearly inspired by. The film almost goes out of its way to diminish any Islamic influence from its story (instead of Jihad, there are references to a crusade). That&#39;s particularly egregious when we see the locals of Arrakis, the blue-eyed sand dwellers known as the Fremen, who are often portrayed as noble savages. At least the film begins with the Fremen perspective: Chani, played by Zendaya, wonders aloud who their next oppressors will be.</p><p>All of this is to say, if you can make it to the theater to see <em>Dune</em>, you should. You can still capture some of its immensity by watching it up close: Pull a chair right up to your TV, or veg out with a laptop as close to your eyeballs as possible. But <em>Dune</em> is a story that hinges on the power of dreams, so it’s almost fitting that it’s best experienced when it overwhelms your reality.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dune-movie-review-cinema-hbo-max-173051367.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">40303099-0a6e-4fa6-8279-231edaefe317</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 17:30:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634927503</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T18:31:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb6a000-335a-11ec-8e3f-9b2de6217e27" width="2000" height="838" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb6a000-335a-11ec-8e3f-9b2de6217e27" width="2000" height="838" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dune]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dune]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter adds one-click Revue newsletter signup buttons to tweets]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/twitter"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> is <a href="https://www.getrevue.co/profile/the_week_in_newsletters/issues/subscribe-from-tweets-a-new-feature-for-revue-writers-820690">rolling out</a> a way for people to sign up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/revue/"><ins>Revue</ins></a> newsletters directly from tweets.

This is where an account, looking to juice their engagement figures, posts an equation with a challenge for people to solve it. Often, it’ll say something like “Only ‘80s Kids Can Do This” or “Brain Power Challenge: Can You Do This Without a Calculator?<em>”. </em>The only problem is that the equation is so ambiguously-written that you can come up with multiple answers.</p><p>Here’s one that I found floating around the internet a couple of days ago from an account that seems to re-share a lot of existing content in the hope of going viral. The tweet reads (in true viral bait style)  “Please don’t use a Calculator, use your BRAIN: 50+50 - 25 x 0 + 2 + 2 = ??”.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7db513ae3a964de0b43eb0aca9195e4f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please don’t use a Calculator, use your BRAIN:<br><br>50 + 50 - 25 x 0 + 2 + 2 = ??</p>— Sonia 💙 (@Sonia_ar7) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sonia_ar7/status/1444007420863385637?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Now, the equation is sufficiently ambiguous in its design that, depending on how you tackle it, it produces a number of different answers. In this instance, users concluded that the answer was definitely 0, 4, 79 or 104. The subsequent chat often breaks out into some discussion about how Order of Operations work and how stupid the other people are. Between argument, counter-argument, and people smugly retweeting about how other people didn’t pay attention to high school math, the original poster has succeeded in getting their engagement.</p><p>But there is a solution, and a neat way of arriving at the correct answer both for this problem and for any others you see online. And I’ve enlisted the help of a mathematician to help explain it so that this sort of viral bait never trips you up ever again. Especially if you don’t recall your PEMDAS (or BODMAS, if you were raised on the other side of the pond) from high school math.</p><p>Dr. Helen Crowley is lecturer in mathematics at the <a href="https://www.uea.ac.uk/">University of East Anglia</a>, and took issue with how I’d described the equation. “The problem shared [above] is not actually ambiguous at all,” she said, “maths is a very well-behaved subject and there are fixed rules that all problems like this follow.” Dr. Crowley is, of course, referring to the Order of Operations, which explains how a multi-part equation like the one above is meant to be broken down and worked out.</p><p>In the US and UK, Order of Operations is expressed under the acronyms PEMDAS (US) or BODMAS (UK). The terms may differ, but the order in which you calculate each component part of the equation remains the same. You start with anything in Parentheses / Brackets, and then move on to anything using Exponents / Orders, which are figures including square-roots and powers. The equation above, uses neither.</p><p>Third in the list is Multiplication and Division, which is the first function that we actually need to do. “For this problem, we [first] do 25 x 0 = 0,” said Dr. Crowley. That 0 then inserts itself into the sum, which now looks like 50 + 50 - 0 + 2 + 2. “The last two operations to consider are Addition and Subtraction,” said Dr. Crowley, making the final sum 50 + 50 - 0 + 2 + 2 = 104. “This is exactly what your calculator does, as it is programmed to ‘know’ the order,” said Dr. Crowley, “the above problem certainly isn’t ambiguous, we are just forgetting the rules.”</p><p>Now, you may be wondering who was in charge of establishing this order, and when that may have happened. According to the UEA’s Dr. Mark Cooker, the current Order of Operations was probably first laid down in their current form in the middle of the 16th century. Before that point, “manuscripts were wholly wordy, and free from operational symbols, except abbreviations,” said Dr. Cooker. But from the mid-16th century onwards, math texts “were first printed in large numbers for education.”</p><p>Cooker then believes that it was the wide-ranging influence of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Transactions_of_the_Royal_Society">Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London</a> that “set new high standards to reduce ambiguity in handling powers, brackets and multiplications or additions, in the correct order.” He said that the journal, as it would now be described, “spread higher standards of maths typography as far afield as St. Petersburg, where Leonard Euler was working.” Euler was one of the most pioneering mathematicians of the 18th century, who “published so many papers and influential textbooks,” along with “clear explanations of BODMAS rules in his elementary texts must have made everyone agree on the current order of operations.”</p><p>Now that you know how to solve those crappy equations people post on social media, don’t forget to share a link to this story to serve as a bulwark against folks cynically trying to juice their engagement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/equation-social-media-scams-numberwang-153015485.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3df02fe6-e745-4780-994a-cf63de448715</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 15:30:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634912071</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T14:14:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/22245600-324d-11ec-bf3f-de1a49e34dba" width="4992" height="3328" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/22245600-324d-11ec-bf3f-de1a49e34dba" width="4992" height="3328" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[C.

The app is now testing affiliate shops, a feature it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creators-challenges-affiliate-commission-193917455.html"><ins>first previewed</ins></a> at its Creator Week event in June, and a dedicated “partnerships” inbox.</p><p>Affiliate shops are an extension of Facebook’s existing shopping features, which are already widely available. But the latest version of the storefronts allow creators to link to products that are already part of their <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/creator-week-2021-new-ways-for-creators-to-make-a-living"><ins>affiliate arrangements</ins></a>. Creators will earn commission fees when their followers buy products from these shops (though the exact terms of these arrangements haven’t been detailed). The company says that for now the shopping feature will only be available to creators who are part of that affiliate program.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instagram is also testing new inbox features it says will make it easier for brands to connect with creators for sponsorships. Instagram DMs will get a dedicated “partnerships” section just for messages from brands. The company says this will give those messages “priority placement” and will allow them to skip the “requests” section where incoming messages are often lost.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6e5f16a0-32ce-11ec-bebb-c24a545ad5d3" style="height:1026;width:1330;" alt="Instagram is testing a new inbox for messages from potential partners." data-uuid="de090c7d-daa8-39ea-b048-dc4e6331a531"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Instagram</div></figure><p>Separately, the app is working on tools to match brands with creators looking for sponsorships. With the tools, creators can identify brands they are interested in working with directly from the app. While brands would be able to browse creators who fit their needs based on factors like age, gender and follower count.</p><p>The tools are still in an early stage, with only a handful of companies and creators participating for now. But the company has previously signaled such features could expand significantly. Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year that Instagram is planning a “branded content marketplace” to help enable a bigger “creator middle class.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-is-testing-affiliate-shops-and-partnerships-inbox-150021537.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea9224fe-f47c-4623-b240-ae5f191bcdbc</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 15:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634862857</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T00:34:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/36918140-32ce-11ec-9aff-5ca5d054d2d6" width="1944" height="1120" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/36918140-32ce-11ec-9aff-5ca5d054d2d6" width="1944" height="1120" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram is testing its new affiliate shopping tools.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IG affiliate shops]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[PlayStation's next State of Play is set for October 27th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sony/"><ins>Sony</ins></a> has announced when its next <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/state%20of%20play/"><ins>State of Play</ins></a> stream will take place. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/10/22/state-of-play-returns-next-wednesday/">You can watch it</a> on October 27th at 5PM ET on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/playstation"><ins>Twitch</ins></a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-2Y8dQb0S6DtpxNgAKoJKA"><ins>YouTube</ins></a>.</p><p>It&#39;ll be a short broadcast, clocking in at 20 minutes or so, but as we saw with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-event-september-2021-sony-recap-video-214354767.html"><ins>Sony&#39;s blockbuster showcase in September</ins></a>, it can pack a lot into these events.

Although Rockstar Games didn’t mark the occasion with a sudden surprise release of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-re-release-gta-3-vice-vity-san-andreas-rockstar-games-155826052.html"><em><ins>Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition</ins></em></a>, it <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/4kaa7414o5k979/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-coming-november-11"><ins>revealed</ins></a> when you’ll be able to get your hands on the upgraded versions of <em>GTA III</em>, <em>GTA: Vice City </em>and <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>.</p><p>The bundle arrives digitally on November 11th (the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gta-v-ps5-xbox-series-x-release-date-142203171.html"><ins>former release date</ins></a> for the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gta-v-sony-playstation-5-march-2022-204016288.html"><em><ins>GTA V</ins></em></a>) on PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S and Nintendo Switch.

It&#39;s worth noting that the remastered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-31-gta-san-andreas-xbox-one-backwards-compatibility.html"><em><ins>GTA: San Andreas</ins></em></a> hits Xbox Game Pass on November 11th and the upgraded <em>GTA III</em> will arrive on PlayStation Now on December 7th.</p><p>The most obvious changes to the games are upgraded, richer visuals. Rockstar has added higher resolution textures, enhanced the weather effects, improved character and vehicle models, overhauled the lighting system and increased draw distances — all while trying to hang onto each game&#39;s original aesthetic.<em> Vice City, </em>for one thing, looks far more vibrant than the original, but it&#39;s clearly still <em>Vice City</em>.</p><p>There are some platform-specific enhancements. PS5 and Xbox Series X players will be able to run the games in 4K at up to 60 frames per second. On PC, there&#39;s support for NVIDIA&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dlss"><ins>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)</ins></a> upscaling tech. Switch players, meanwhile, will have gyro controls and can use the touchscreen to to navigate menus and to zoom and pan the camera.</p><p>Rockstar has tweaked the gameplay in other ways. The controller layout now matches that of <em>GTA V, </em>and there are changes to gunplay and targeting, the weapon and radio station selection wheels and minimaps (such as the ability to set waypoints). You&#39;ll also be able to immediately restart a mission after failing too, which is a great quality of life update.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-remastered-trilogy-release-date-140952983.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee78e0bc-bd64-497d-87b5-aa83d8097426</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 14:09:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634911795</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T14:10:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/96bf04e0-333f-11ec-bfab-6b81acd6de4f" width="1530" height="845" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/96bf04e0-333f-11ec-bfab-6b81acd6de4f" width="1530" height="845" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rockstar Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot of the cityscpace from Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Grand Theft Auto: Vice City in Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Stardew Valley' creator's next game is 'Haunted Chocolatier']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Stardew Valley</em> creator Eric Barone, aka &quot;ConcernedApe,&quot; has made a surprise unveiling of his next game, <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/"><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a>. It has the same pixelated SNES look as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stardew-valley-1-5-update-214401409.html"><em>Stardew</em></a><em>,</em> with characters, set-pieces and themes that are similarly cute and quirky.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;In this game, you will play as a chocolatier living in a haunted castle. In order to thrive in your new role, you will have to gather rare ingredients, make delicious chocolates, and sell them in a chocolate shop,&quot; according to Barone&#39;s <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/">blog</a> on the new website. The video shows characters heading out into into a town, the castle, a mountain and other scenarios to seek ingredients and fend off creatures.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0ca5263b0e7a41508fdb8173cce999ff"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kJy7LF789lo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>It&#39;s Barone&#39;s first game since <em>Stardew Valley</em> launched in 2016, but so far it&#39;s not a lot more than a demo. Barone has yet to finalize the gameplay systems, and said he doesn&#39;t even want to be &quot;tied down to any particular concept of what the game is&quot; ahead of launch.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> does sound and look a lot like <em>Stardew</em> at first take. However, in a FAQ, Barone said there will be some substantial differences, particularly when it comes to gameplay.</p><blockquote><p>Like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> is another &quot;town game,&quot; where you move to a new town and try your hand at a new way of living. You’ll get to know the townspeople, achieve your goals and make progress in many ways. All of that is similar to <em>Stardew Valley</em>. However, the core gameplay and theming are quite a bit different. <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> is more of an action-RPG compared to <em>Stardew Valley</em>. And instead of a farm being the focal point of your endeavors, it’s a chocolate shop.</p></blockquote><p>Barone wouldn&#39;t reveal other details, like whether the new title is set in the same world as <em>Stardew</em>, nor a release date or even a general timeframe. He did say that it would be single-player only, with no plans for multiplayer. The game will &quot;100 percent&quot; come to PC, though he has &quot;every intention of bringing it to the other major platforms as well.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/stardew-valley-creators-next-game-is-haunted-chocolatier-133102155.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">722f07f5-38a7-4f18-87bd-e3a8dbb3de93</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 13:31:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634909562</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T13:32:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a274e370-3337-11ec-bfff-f4f39e50f7ad" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a274e370-3337-11ec-bfff-f4f39e50f7ad" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eric Barone]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Stardew Valley' creator's next game is 'Haunted Chocolatier']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Stardew Valley' creator's next game is 'Haunted Chocolatier']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's WH-1000XM4 headphones fall to $248, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week brought our first official <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-deals-best-buy-early-black-friday-sale-october-2021-121526669.html">early Black Friday sale</a>, courtesy of Best Buy.

According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/trump-truth-social-fake-accounts/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, someone signed up for an account on the test website, took the username &quot;donaldjtrump&quot; and posted a photo of a defecating pig.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump and his team recently announced that they&#39;re launching TRUTH Social in early 2022 and that beta tests will begin in November. In its announcement, the team said that the platform is part of its efforts to fight against &quot;the Big Tech companies of Silicon Valley, which have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The test website has already been pulled down, but not before one of the publication&#39;s reporters was able to sign up under the name &quot;mikepence&quot; without encountering any safeguards that would prevent them from doing so. Based on the mock photos on its <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/truth-social/id1586018825">App Store listing</a>, TRUTH Social looks like a Twitter clone, where users can post &quot;Truths&quot; similar to tweets and repost &quot;Re-Truths,&quot; which are basically retweets. It has a news feed called the Truth Feed and a notification system, as well.</p><p>The website&#39;s code shows that it runs on a mostly unmodified version of open source software Mastodon, <em>The Post </em>says. Mastodon founder Eugen Rochko told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgm5k/truth-social-is-mastodon-trump"><em>Vice</em></a> that the platform might be violating its licensing rules, since it requires developers to share any modification with the public and to give credit by linking to the original source code. The test website didn&#39;t just reveal TRUTH Social&#39;s code, though, but also its <a href="https://truthsocial.com/terms-of-service/">terms of service</a>. A sub-section in the ToS shows that the website hopes to be protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p><p>Part of the ToS reads: &quot;[W]e are not responsible for any Third-Party Websites accessed through the Site or any Third-Party Content posted on, available through, or installed from the Site, including the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability, privacy practices, or other policies of or contained in the Third-Party Websites or the Third-Party Content.&quot;</p><p>Trump has been a very vocal critic of Section 230. In 2020, he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-executive-order-social-media-section-230-144905272.html">signed</a> an executive order meant to limit its scope shortly after Twitter fact-checked a false tweet he made. The order was never meaningfully imposed, but President Biden <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-revokes-trump-social-media-executive-order-170713081.html">revoked</a> it completely back in May.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/trump-social-network-defaced-124507041.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9989f09-d5bb-4d38-9efb-6ebd0e188907</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 12:45:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634917844</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T15:50:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/22320b60-332e-11ec-bdcc-97b6e0802ed9" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/22320b60-332e-11ec-bdcc-97b6e0802ed9" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TRUTH Social]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TRUTH Social]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TRUTH Social]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: Apple’s new MacBook Pros, the Pixel 6 and the Surface Duo 2]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Techtober continues with a deep dive into Apple’s latest MacBook Pros, powered by the new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips.

cases]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/lyft-shared-rides-return-133317382.html">Lyft</a> has finally published its <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/q8mvene1wzq4/4jxkFTH5YCQK8T96STULMd/4269e14dbcb8578ff64da45df08b8147/Community_Safety_Report.pdf">first safety report</a> (PDF), which sheds light on the rate of sexual assault and abuse cases on the service in the US over the course of three years. From 2017 until 2019, Lyft received a total of 4,158 sexual assault reports. The company&#39;s safety team divided all sexual assault and misconduct incidents into 21 categories, but the cases included in this report only include five of the most serious categories of sexual assault.</p><p>Those categories are non-consensual kissing of a non-sexual/sexual body part, non-consensual touching of a sexual body part, attempted non-consensual sexual penetration and non-consensual sexual penetration. There are lesser categories of sexual assault that weren&#39;t included in the total number of cases.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Among the five, the most commonly reported incidents fall under the non-consensual touching of a sexual body part category. The team recorded 360 incidents of rape within that period. Lyft said that it included any incident reported over the three-year period regardless of when it actually happened, because sexual assault is chronically underreported. Further, it intentionally used broad definitions for the sub-categories.In addition to sexual assault cases, Lyft has also reported 105 motor vehicle fatalities and 10 fatal physical assaults.&nbsp;</p><p>The company explained that it doesn&#39;t proactively report safety incidents to law enforcement, knowing that it&#39;s a deeply personal decision, especially for survivors of sexual assault. &quot;This policy gives survivors as much agency as possible when deciding whether and how to report an incident,&quot; it wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Lyft has been promising to release a safety report since 2018, and when <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/11/tech/lyft-sexual-assault-incidents-safety/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a> asked about it earlier this year, the company cited an issue with the California Public Utilities Commission for the delay. According to the news organization, at least 72 individuals are suing the ride-hailing service over alleged sexual assault incidents. Some of those cases accuse Lyft of knowing that its drivers were raping passengers and failing to take steps to protect its customers.</p><p>Uber, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-05-uber-safety-report-2019.html">published</a> its first safety report in 2019. The company revealed nearly 6,000 reports of sexual abuse over 2017 and 2018, as well as 19 fatal physical assaults.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lyfts-first-safety-report-4000-sexual-assault-cases-113547009.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">50ff70e6-432a-4ed8-82bb-613f36883025</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 11:35:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634903718</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T11:55:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/daed37d0-d019-11e9-bfff-fe77cba38ab3" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/daed37d0-d019-11e9-bfff-fe77cba38ab3" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[jetcityimage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Las Vegas - Circa June 2019: Lyft Las Vegas Hub.

Borrowing technology from the recent A1 and A7S III models, it has some substantial improvements over the A7 III introduced well over three years ago. There’s an all-new 33-megapixel sensor, 4K 10-bit 60 fps video, new AI autofocus tricks and a lot more, including some new live streaming and sharing features, though they&#39;re not quite up to the level we&#39;ve seen on other recent cameras. You can do video and audio streaming over USB-C at up to 1080p 60 or 4K 15p if resolution is a priority over smooth video.</p><p>The A7 IV is clearly a massive leap forward for Sony&#39;s &quot;basic&quot; full-frame mirrorless camera series, putting it on par — or ahead of — most rivals. The only deterrent is the $2,500 price tag ($2,699 with a kit lens), which is $500 more than the A7 III cost at launch.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-camera-arrives-with-a-33-megapixel-sensor-and-4k-60p-video-141301936.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-buy-a-monitor-143000069.html">How to buy a monitor in 2021</a></h2><h3>We help you narrow down the multitude of choices available.</h3><h3></h3><p>With the pandemic still upon us and Work From Home directives continuing, a monitor is one of the most important computer buying decisions you can make.

The Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) said it <a href="https://www.forensischinstituut.nl/actueel/nieuws/2021/10/21/opgeslagen-data-in-autos-bevatten-een-schat-aan-informatie-voor-strafrechtelijke-onderzoeken">discovered</a> a wealth of information about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">Tesla&#39;s Autopilot</a>, along with data around speed, accelerator pedal positions, steering wheel angle and more. The findings will allow the government to &quot;request more targeted data&quot; to help determine the cause of accidents, the investigators said.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers already knew that Tesla vehicles encrypt and store accident related data, but not which data and how much. As such, they reverse-engineered the system and succeeded in &quot;obtaining data from the models S, Y, X and 3,&quot; which they described in a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355202701_Reverse_engineering_and_evaluation_of_Tesla_vehicle_logs">paper</a> presented at an accident analysis conference.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>These data contain a wealth of information for forensic investigators and traffic accident analysts and can help with a criminal investigation after a fatal traffic accident or an accident with injury.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>With knowledge of how to decrypt the storage, the NFI carried out tests with a Tesla Model S so it could compare the logs with real-world data. It found that the vehicle logs were &quot;very accurate,&quot; with deviations less than 1 km/h (about 0.6 MPH).</p><p>The NSI also analyzed several accidents using the raw data it acquired. In one case, a Tesla on Autopilot collided with a car ahead that suddenly braked. Normally, if the Autopilot doesn&#39;t brake in time, the driver is supposed to take over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;In this case, the investigation showed that the driver did indeed intervene and also within the expected response time,&quot; said researcher Aart Spek. &quot;The fact that it turned out to be a collision was because the following distance [chosen by Autopilot] was too tight in the busy traffic situation. That makes it interesting, because who is responsible for the following distance: the car or the driver?&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>It used to be possible to extract Autopilot data from Tesla EVs, but it&#39;s now encrypted in recent models, the investigators said. Tesla encrypts data for good reason, they acknowledged, including protecting its own IP from other manufacturers and guarding a driver&#39;s privacy. It also noted that the company does provide specific data to authorities and investigators if requested.</p><p>However, the team said that the extra data they extracted would allow for more detailed accident investigations, &quot;especially into the role of driver assistance systems.&quot; It added that it would be ideal to know if other manufacturers stored the same level of detail over long periods of time. &quot;If we would know better which data car manufacturers all store, we can also make more targeted claims through the courts or the Public Prosecution Service,&quot; said NFI investigator Frances Hoogendijk. &quot;And ultimately that serves the interest of finding the truth after an accident.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/a-dutch-government-lab-has-decoded-teslas-driving-data-for-the-first-time-085709633.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">86656c1a-4e8c-47d9-af9f-936a46c5e455</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 08:57:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634893032</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T08:57:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transport Accident]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/30c656f0-3314-11ec-9fef-cc5a379c050a" width="1600" height="1008" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/30c656f0-3314-11ec-9fef-cc5a379c050a" width="1600" height="1008" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Dutch government lab has decoded Tesla's driving data for the first time]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[A Dutch government lab has decoded Tesla's driving data for the first time]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SpaceX's SN20 Starship prototype completes its first static fire test]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX has taken a major step towards sending the Starship to orbit. On Thursday night, the private space corporation has conducted the SN20 Starship prototype&#39;s first static fire test as part of its preparation for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-flight-plan-222943282.html">spacecraft&#39;s launch</a>. According to <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-prototype-sn20-first-static-fire-video"><em>Space</em></a>, the SN20 is currently outfitted with two Raptor engines: A standard &quot;sea-level&quot; Raptor and a vacuum version designed to operate in space. At 8:16PM Eastern time on Thursday, the company fired the latter. SpaceX then revealed on Twitter that it was the first ever firing of a Raptor vacuum engine integrated onto a Starship.</p><div id="c7ca2dd9691a43e8b43b86aa99ef66a0"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First firing of a Raptor vacuum engine integrated onto a Starship <a href="https://t.co/uCNAt8Kwzo">pic.twitter.com/uCNAt8Kwzo</a></p>— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1451350259729420288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Around an hour after that, the SN20 lit up yet again in a second static fire test that may have involved both Raptor engines. The SN20 will eventually have six Raptors — three standard and three vacuum — and will be the first prototype to attempt an orbital launch. A Starship launch system is comprised of the Starship spacecraft itself and a massive first-stage booster called the Super Heavy. Both are designed to be reusable and to carry large payloads for trips to low and higher Earth orbits. It can also eventually be used for longer trips to the Moon and to Mars.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>SpaceX doesn&#39;t have a date for the SN20 test flight yet, but the plan is to launch the vehicle with the Super Heavy known as Booster 4 from the company&#39;s Boca Chica site.

As we mentioned in our review, the main difference between this device and the Series 6 is its slightly bigger display, Now, iFixit&#39;s teardown shows that its display uses touch-integrated OLED panel or &quot;on-cell touch,&quot; which debuted with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The website says the move is unusual for Apple, since it typically introduces new display tech — such as OLED, always-on and variable refresh rate — on the lower-volume Apple Watch first instead of the other way around. According to the former Apple engineers iFixit worked with for this teardown, this new display may have caused production delays and made the company release the device later than it would&#39;ve liked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When the tech giant first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-supercut-201538409.html">announced</a> the Series 7 in September, it didn&#39;t have a concrete release date. The former Apple engineers said that usually signals delays, and the most likely culprit was the manufacturing hiccups caused by the Watch&#39;s display. &quot;[S]creens have some of the most complex supply chains and assembly processes in the industry,&quot; the website explained. In addition to using new technology, Apple also made the display bigger and gave it a refractive edge to make the sides look like they&#39;re slightly curved.&nbsp;</p><p>iFixit also found that the model&#39;s battery is larger than its predecessors. That doesn&#39;t translate to longer battery life, though, since the device&#39;s larger screen likely uses more power. There are a few other more minor changes compared to previous versions of the Watch.

The locks should be particularly useful for corraling rowdy participants, but some hosts may also find it helpful for encouraging specific individuals to participate more often.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-audio-001821609.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3abe01bf-99f9-46f3-8124-5344951f1892</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 00:18:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634853812</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T22:03:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3d913db0-32b9-11ec-b7f6-f837a8db7164" width="640" height="398" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3d913db0-32b9-11ec-b7f6-f837a8db7164" width="640" height="398" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Meet]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Meet]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The new 16-inch MacBook Pro offers a speed-enhancing 'High Power Mode']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html">redesigned MacBook Pro</a> might be more powerful than you think, provided you have the right configuration. Apple has confirmed to Engadget and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/21/new-macbook-pros-high-power-mode/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> that the 16-inch MacBook Pro with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/m-1-max-pro-announced-upscaled-131531800.html">M1 Max chip</a> can invoke a previously hinted-at &quot;High Power Mode.&quot; While the company was shy on details, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html">macOS Monterey</a> beta code suggested the mode would &quot;optimize performance&quot; for demanding tasks in return for the possibility of more fan noise.</p><p>This could be frustrating if you buy either the 14-inch MacBook Pro or a 16-inch system with the M1 Pro. This isn&#39;t surprising, though. Features like this by their nature drive up power consumption and heat, and Apple may want to make sure there&#39;s enough battery and thermal headroom (that is, a larger enclosure). The M1 Max is also a better fit for a mode like this than the M1 Pro — there&#39;s simply more performance to unlock.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you do buy a higher-end MacBook Pro, though, this could be particularly helpful. Many pro users have moments when they need performance at all costs, such as a hurried video export or last-minute code compile. High Power Mode might help finish those tasks on time while putting a ceiling on noise in most situations.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-16-inch-macbook-pro-high-power-mode-m1-max-232408937.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6c893137-b40a-4674-8a5a-914e7846b37a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 23:24:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634852482</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T21:41:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bcdc7f10-32b1-11ec-b455-2568f31b232b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bcdc7f10-32b1-11ec-b455-2568f31b232b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (2021) with Final Cut Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (2021) with Final Cut Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
