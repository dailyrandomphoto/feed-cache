Unlike the previous model, the Smart Soundbar 900 has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dolby%20atmos">Dolby Atmos</a> support.</p><p>The company claims the Soundbar 900 goes beyond the overhead spatial audio offered by most Atmos soundbars. It says Bose PhaseGuide tech can create horizontal audio effects as well. The Soundbar 900 blends Bose&#39;s spatial audio knowhow with custom arrays, dipole transducers and low-profile transducers to create &quot;a layer of realism,&quot; according to the company. Even if the show or movie you&#39;re watching doesn&#39;t support Dolby Atmos, Bose says its tech can still create effective spatial audio effects by remixing signals.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bose is promising strong bass performance with almost no distortion with the help of its QuietPort tech. The Adaptiq feature, meanwhile, calibrates audio for your space.</p><p>The speaker includes decent connectivity, including HDMI eARC for hooking it up to your TV, as well as WiFi, Bluetooth, Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, Spotify Connect and AirPlay 2 support. You can link the device to other Bose smart speakers, including as part of a multi-room system, and expand your home theater setup with a subwoofer or rear satellite speakers. The Soundbar 900 is also compatible with the company&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-headphones-price-specs-availability-133006735.html">QuietComfort 45 headphones</a>.</p><p>The device has rounded corners and it&#39;s 2.3 inches tall, a little over four inches deep and 41 inches long (a couple of inches longer than the Soundbar 700). It&#39;s designed primarily for 50-inch and larger TVs; it might look out of place below a smaller screen.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/speakers/home_theater/bose-smart-soundbar-900.html?mc=25_AF_MU_AO_00_CJ_&amp;affiliateid=CJ100038666&amp;cjevent=68a4bff20fe711ec82cd03e90a82b824&amp;Publisher=Skimlinks#v=bose_smart_soundbar_900_black&amp;cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww">Smart Soundbar 900 costs $900</a>.

These women do" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figcaption></figure><p>If you&#39;re reading this, you probably already know what an Instant Pot is, but just in case you don&#39;t, here&#39;s a brief introduction. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Instant Pot" href="https://amzn.to/3kYvrdK">Instant Pot</a> is an &quot;all-in-one&quot; kitchen gadget that promises to replace a rice cooker, a yogurt maker and a slow cooker; it also lets you sauté and steam foods. But the real reason the Instant Pot has risen to fame is that it&#39;s also a very good electric pressure cooker. This lets you cook food at an accelerated rate; imagine pulled pork in an hour instead of five or a chicken curry done in 10 minutes. And because it&#39;s electric, you just press a few buttons and walk away. Unlike a stovetop pressure cooker, there&#39;s no need to keep a constant eye on it.</p><p>There are a bunch of Instant Pot models to choose from. Some of the lower-end ones lack the yogurt-maker, and a couple of the higher-end models have extra features like sous-vide cooking and canning, but all have the electric pressure cooker function, so much of this guide will focus on that. The Instant Pot comes in 3-, 6- and 8-quart sizes. Unless you&#39;re only cooking for yourself or you have a large family, I think the 6-quart model should work for most people.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3kYvrdK" id="cce88a6b9389414486187826c5f958dd" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Instant Pot Duo at Amazon - $89</a><p>A brief word on other Instant Pot models:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Duo Plus" href="https://amzn.to/3hcwDJ8">Duo Plus</a> (starting at $100) is an upgraded version of the Duo Series. It has two additional functions: sous vide (for temperature-controlled cooking) and sterilizer (a steam shortcut for sterilizing items like baby bottles). There’s also a cooking progress status bar plus an anti-spin design that keeps the inner pot in place when you’re sauteing.</p></li><li><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Pro" href="https://amzn.to/38Mbscl">Pro</a> (starting at $115) is designed for the serious cooking enthusiast, with plenty of upgrades over existing Instant Pots. The inner pot has an extra thick bottom that can go on the stove, plus it has handles so it’s easier to lift. It comes with 28 customizable programs for different foods, and there are five favorites buttons that you can assign to frequently cooked meals. The steam release switch has been upgraded to reduce noise and splatter, and there are even steam release reminder alerts with 5- and 10-minute pre-sets. The Pro is also one of a few Instant Pots compatible with an optional QuickCool lid that helps you release pressure faster.</p></li><li><p>The<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid: Duo Crisp + Air Fryer ($180)" href="https://amzn.to/3tlQuue"> Duo Crisp + Air Fryer ($180)</a> is basically an Instant Pot that comes with an additional Air Fryer Lid, which adds dry-heat cooking methods like baking, broiling, dehydrating and of course air-frying. There’s also a Pro version of this Instant Pot ($200) that pairs the air fryer lid with the Pro model mentioned above.</p></li><li><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Star Wars Instant Pots" href="https://amzn.to/3yLiuJ7">Star Wars Instant Pots</a> ($100) are a great choice for the Star Wars enthusiast or just anyone who wants a fun and unique kitchen appliance. They’re really just rebranded versions of the Duo, with the same exact functionalities and features. They come in five iterations: Little Bounty, Darth Vader, Stormtrooper, BB-8, and R2-D2.</p></li></ul><p></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h3>Which Instant Pot model is right for you?</h3><ul><li><p>The<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid: 6-quart Instant Pot" href="https://amzn.to/3nhT9UK"> 6-quart Instant Pot</a> is ideal for most people, but if you’re a singleton or a student, then the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:3-quart model" href="https://amzn.to/38Oc0i4">3-quart model</a> is best.

Setup is as easy as putting the inner pot inside the housing and plugging it in. You&#39;ll also want to attach a tiny condensation collector on the back if the instructions call for it.</p><figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dimse/5845cadfecd996e0372f/e787f3868a7c379692bf434ad7bff8c901c0bf53/Y3JvcD0zMDAwJTJDMTk2MiUyQzAlMkMwJnF1YWxpdHk9ODUmZm9ybWF0PWpwZyZyZXNpemU9MTYwMCUyQzEwNDYmaW1hZ2VfdXJpPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGcy55aW1nLmNvbSUyRm9zJTJGY3JlYXRyLWltYWdlcyUyRjIwMTgtMTElMkZjMDJmMzY5MC1lYzE4LTExZTgtOGNmYS1mYTRlOTM0MWYyMjUmY2xpZW50PWExYWNhYzNlMWIzMjkwOTE3ZDkyJnNpZ25hdHVyZT1iMzE5YjBiZmEzNDhjZGNjZDIwZWExNzYyYjY2NTkxNGZiNmMwMDgw" alt="Instant Pot Super Bowl cookoff" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figcaption></figure><p>The first thing to do is a &quot;water test,&quot; which not only helps familiarize you with the basic pressure-cooker features but will confirm your appliance is in proper working order.</p><p>To do a water test, put three cups of water in the pot, twist the lid on — it&#39;ll make a sound when it&#39;s locked in place — and set the pressure cooker on high for two minutes. The way to do this varies from model to model; on the Duo machines, you&#39;ll have to press Manual, select High, then dial down the time to two minutes. On something like the Ultra, you just need to go to the Pressure Cooker menu, dial it to two minutes and select High.</p><p>Then make sure your valve is set to &quot;Sealing&quot; so that the Instant Pot can build pressure. On the Duo machines, this means rotating it so the arrow points up, while on the Ultra, the valve will automatically be set to Sealing.</p><p>Then press &quot;Start.&quot; From there, the Instant Pot will build up that pressure to High, maintain it for the set two minutes, and then stop. In some cases, you&#39;ll hear hissing and see steam coming out of the Instant Pot. This is totally normal. You&#39;ll know the Instant Pot is under pressure when the float valve pops up and the hissing quiets down.</p><p>The lid cannot be opened when the Instant Pot is under pressure. You <em>must</em> depressurize it first. Once the cooking is done, you can let the pot naturally depressurize (also known as &quot;Natural Release&quot;), which simply means leaving it alone for 20 or so minutes until the float valve comes down.</p><p>Or you can do a manual release (also known as &quot;Quick Release&quot;) by switching that aforementioned valve to &quot;Venting.&quot; To do that on the Duo models, you rotate the valve, while on the Ultra, you&#39;ll press a steam release button on the top. This method will release a lot of steam, so I suggest doing this under a range hood if you have one. Again, once the float valve comes back down, you&#39;ll know the Instant Pot has been depressurized.</p><p>Doing the water test teaches you the basics of sealing the Instant Pot, setting it and depressurizing it. Plus, if anything goes wrong along the way — especially if it doesn&#39;t seal the pressure — you can call the retailer or manufacturer to troubleshoot or ask about a return or exchange. It&#39;s a step that many people skip, but I recommend it, especially if you&#39;re a beginner.</p><h2>Instant Pot accessories</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/c15f01d0-e2f7-11ea-9ae7-30869688d118" alt="Instant Pot accessories" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figcaption></figure><p>The Instant Pot is ready to use right out of the box, but if you want to get even more functionality out of it, then you might want to consider some accessories. The following are just a few suggestions that we think will elevate your Instant Pot experience.</p><h3>Tempered glass lid</h3><p>The main reason to get an Instant Pot is to use it as a pressure cooker, but it has other functions too. If you want to use it as a slow cooker or you simply want to keep your food warm, then you’ll want to invest in a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:tempered glass lid" href="https://amzn.to/3zTVCZ0">tempered glass lid</a>. This lid will also keep your food covered if you want to transfer the inner pot to the table or the fridge.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3zTVCZ0" id="aef8153f55e34091988da3e16fc1e495" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy glass lid at Amazon - $15</a><h3>Steamers/PIP</h3><p>Steaming food in the Instant Pot is quick and easy, but you’ll want specific equipment to get the job done right. Instant Pot makes two styles of silicone steamers; one is a <a href="https://amzn.to/327hhNX">stacking model</a> that you can use for dumplings or fish, and another is a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:collapsible one" href="https://amzn.to/3tjK4fn">collapsible one</a> that is ideal for batch-cooking vegetables. If you need even more capacity, we recommend this <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hatrigo mesh steamer basket" href="https://amzn.to/3yMbrzD">Hatrigo mesh steamer basket</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Along your Instant Pot discovery journey, you might come across a phrase called “PIP cooking.” This stands for Pot-in-Pot and involves putting another vessel inside the Instant Pot. This method is great if you’re cooking foods that don’t contain liquid (such as cheesecake) or you simply want to cook in smaller quantities. One of our favorite accessories for this is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Aozita Stackable Steamer" href="https://amzn.to/2X0rj4j">Aozita Stackable Steamer</a>, which not only acts as a steamer, but also contains tiered containers so that you could cook multiple foods at once.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3hcDmCX" id="a3481541ac0943918a866343ab762999" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy stackable steamer basket at Amazon - $10</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3tjK4fn" id="21c06e0ed2e3401ba36ceffe2070d620" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy steamer basket at Amazon - $15</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3yMbrzD" id="8ede5b2f57544fecac7b6460936147bf" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Hatrigo steamer basket at Amazon - $18</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2X0rj4j" id="c6e9d978bc8545c5b735eb2d64625571" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Aozita stackable steamers at Amazon - $30</a><h3>Sealing ring</h3><p>If you use your Instant Pot for both savory and sweet applications, then we suggest getting extra <a href="https://amzn.to/31dFpyV">sealing rings</a> so that the odor of one doesn’t affect the other. You don’t really want your cheesecake to smell like pulled pork or vice versa.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2X0rBrV" id="bc6ce7f278004cbca5e6abc9bc7b8fc2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy sealing rings at Amazon - $12</a><h3>Air fryer lid</h3><p>As the name suggests, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Instant Pot Air Fryer Lid" href="https://amzn.to/3tjKF0B">Instant Pot Air Fryer Lid</a> essentially turns your Instant Pot into an air fryer. It’s a good option if you don’t want two appliances taking up space on your kitchen counter, and this add-on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-instant-pot-air-fryer-lid-accessory.html">does a decent job of “air frying” foods</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, after using it for a few months, I don’t quite recommend it if you plan on cooking a lot of meals this way. The non-stick coating on the fry basket can flake off if placed in the dishwasher, and as I’ve discovered, it accumulates a sticky film that is almost impossible to wash off. Plus, as I said in an earlier hands-on, the Lid really only works for small batches as well as smaller pieces of food. Even a hot dog is too large to fit inside the air fryer basket.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re going to use the air-fryer lid to add roasting and broiling capabilities to the Instant Pot — so you can brown a roast chicken or melt the cheese on a lasagna, for example — then it’s not a bad option. But as far as air-frying goes, I’d probably save up and invest in an actual convection toaster oven rather than settle for the lid.</p><h2>Tips and tricks</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/8da1f630-e2f8-11ea-bd7e-854a192ce848" alt="Instant Pot with Air Fryer Lid" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figcaption></figure><p>Let&#39;s go over a few tips and tricks on how to best use the Instant Pot. This is not an exhaustive list, as different people might have different takeaways from their usage of the Instant Pot, but these insights are what I found works best for me.</p><h3>Don&#39;t worry about all the buttons</h3><p>When you first get the Instant Pot, you might be overwhelmed by all of the different buttons on the front of it. There are ones that say &quot;Meat/Stew,&quot; &quot;Chili/Beans,&quot; &quot;Multigrain,&quot; &quot;Egg&quot; and even &quot;Cake.&quot; With the exception of a few, most of these are simply shortcuts that Instant Pot programmed ahead of time. You might never need to use them.</p><p>The most important buttons to know are &quot;Sauté,&quot; which (as you might expect) lets you sauté things in the pot, and the aforementioned &quot;Manual&quot; or &quot;Pressure Cooker&quot; function. The rest are pretty superfluous, with the exception of &quot;Keep Warm,&quot; &quot;Cancel&quot; and non-pressure cooker functions like the &quot;Slow Cooker&quot; or &quot;Yogurt&quot; (which helps maintain the cultured milk at a specific temperature).</p><h3>Add at least half a cup of liquid, and don&#39;t go over the maximum</h3><p>One of the things you&#39;ll learn about pressure cooking is that you don&#39;t need to add as much liquid like you would in regular recipes. But you&#39;ll still need to add <em>some </em>liquid because the pressure cooker requires some moisture to build that pressure. Otherwise, the Instant Pot could overheat and show an &quot;OvHT&quot; error on the display. On the other hand, you shouldn&#39;t fill it up beyond two-thirds capacity, which is handily marked on the inside of the inner pot. The Instant Pot probably won&#39;t explode on you — it has a lot of safety features to prevent that — but you probably shouldn&#39;t test its boundaries.</p><h3>Cooking times aren&#39;t always accurate</h3><p>Setting the pressure cooker timer for two minutes doesn&#39;t mean the entire cooking time is two minutes. You have to take into account the amount of time the Instant Pot needs to come to pressure and the time it&#39;ll need to depressurize. The more stuff you have in the pot (and the colder it is), the longer it&#39;ll take. Because of that, a &quot;five-minute&quot; chicken curry could really be more like 10 or 15 minutes from start to finish.</p><h3>Clean it carefully and frequently</h3><p>The inner pot is dishwasher safe, which is great, but the rest has to be cleaned by hand. Also, don&#39;t make the same mistake I did and accidentally spill something hot directly on the cooking element. The outer shell is hard to clean because you can&#39;t put it in the sink — electricity and water don&#39;t mix, after all — and you risk damaging the appliance. As for the lid, hand wash it after every use. You&#39;ll also notice after a while that the sealing ring — the rubber/silicone gasket on the inside of the lid — might develop an odd smell as it absorbs the scent of the food you&#39;re cooking. I recommend soaking it in a vinegar solution, or you could also put it on the top rack of your dishwasher for a couple of cycles.</p><h3>Consider a separate sealing ring</h3><p>If you find yourself cooking desserts in addition to savory meals — it&#39;s great for making cheesecakes and puddings — I recommend a separate sealing ring just for that. You probably don&#39;t want your cheesecake to smell like pulled pork, unless you&#39;re into that sort of thing.</p><h3>You can&#39;t cook everything with it</h3><p>Sure, you can cook everything from dog food to jam in the Instant Pot, but it&#39;s not a miracle worker. You can&#39;t deep fry in it. You can&#39;t bake a pie in it. Don&#39;t be ridiculous.</p><h2>Recipes and guides</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/d6e85aa0-e2f8-11ea-bedf-198e4fcf3257" alt="This is a wide angle photograph of an African American father in his 40s preparing food for cooking dinner with his 17 year old daughter in their home kitchen in Miami, Florida." data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit"></div></figcaption></figure><p>Now you&#39;re all ready to cook, and you&#39;re probably dying to know what to make in your newfangled machine. Due to the popularity of the Instant Pot, you&#39;ll find no shortage of cookbooks and recipe tutorials online. That aforementioned Facebook group is a good place to start, and there are numerous YouTube videos that are helpful as well. Here are just a few of my favorites:</p><h3><a href="https://www.pressurecookrecipes.com/how-to-use-instant-pot/"><strong>Pressure Cook Recipes</strong></a></h3><p>Amy and Jacky are part of the OG Instant Pot community, and their site is great for beginners. Not only will you get the low-down on the aforementioned water test, but you&#39;ll also get great recipes for bone broth, &quot;fail-proof&quot; rice, yogurt, cheesecake and more.</p><h3><a href="https://nomnompaleo.com/post/125878339293/my-top-paleo-pressure-cookerinstant-pot-recipes"><strong>Nom Nom Paleo</strong></a></h3><p>Whether or not you&#39;re into the &quot;paleo&quot; lifestyle, you&#39;ll like Michelle Tam&#39;s list of Instant Pot recipes. Pressure cookers are great for shortening the amount of time for cooking braised meats, and she has a lot of recipes that cater to your inner carnivore. Her Instant Pot pulled pork recipe is still my go-to, and the short ribs are great as well.</p><h3><a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/roundups/pressure-cooker-recipes"><strong>Serious Eats</strong></a></h3><p>My personal favorite site for pressure-cooker recipes is probably Serious Eats. All of these recipes are fantastic. I&#39;ve tried the chicken stock, the mushroom risotto, the chicken pho, the chicken and chickpea masala, and they&#39;ve all been outstanding.</p><h3><a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/4441089-24-recipes-to-make-in-your-instant-pot-or-pressure-cooker"><strong><em>The New York Times</em></strong></a></h3><p>Another personal favorite is <em>The New York Times</em> cooking section, which has a list of wonderful pressure-cooker-friendly recipes. My favorites are from Melissa Clark, who has written two Instant Pot cookbooks: <em>Dinner In an Instant</em> and <em>Comfort in an Instant</em>. There&#39;s a recipe in <em>Comfort in an Instant</em> for spaghetti and meatballs that I was hugely skeptical of but turned out to be one of the most amazing things I&#39;ve ever made. I also love the recipes for chicken korma and shrimp biryani.</p><h3><a href="https://tillerandhatch.com/">Tiller &amp; Hatch</a></h3><p>If you’re at a complete loss with what to do with your Instant Pot, then we recommend trying out products from <a href="https://tillerandhatch.com/products">Tiller &amp; Hatch</a>, a company that specializes in pressure cooker-ready frozen meals. Simply unload the contents of a bag into your Instant Pot, follow the instructions and you’ll have dinner in minutes. Some of the meals are better than others — I prefer the minestrone soup over the gnocchi — but on the whole I think they’re a pretty good value. Each bag costs around $16 and has four servings each. You can sign up for a subscription plan on the website, or pick up individual meals from select Wal-Mart and Target locations.</p><h2>Other sources</h2><p>Here are a few other guides that I found very useful in my own Instant Pot journey, and they contain links to many more recipes and sites than I have space for here:</p><ul><li><p><a href="http://mrgan.com/ip/">Neven Mrgan&#39;s Instant Pot guide</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.101cookbooks.com/instant-pot-starter-guide/">The Instant Pot Starter Guide from 101 Cookbooks</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/50-recipes-that-you-can-make-in-your-instant-pot-233637">50+ recipes to make in your Instant Pot by thekitchn</a></p></li></ul><p>With all of this information in your arsenal, you should have no fear in picking up an Instant Pot. Thankfully, not only is the base model pretty affordable at less than $100, Amazon frequently puts it on sale either on Prime Day or on Black Friday. So if you haven&#39;t bought one just yet, it&#39;s not a bad idea to wait until one of those times of year to get one at a deep discount. And when you do, come on back here, read through the guide once more and venture off on your own pressure-filled culinary adventures.</p><p>Images: Detroit Free Press via Getty Images (First Instapot); Portland Press Herald via Getty Images (Instapot / chopping board); Boogich via Getty Images (cooking)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-15-instant-pot-guide.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2f9c93f0-e788-30c5-8ca9-e8270f7b36b0</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 14:30:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631025027</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T14:30:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[instantpot]]></category><category><![CDATA[news]]></category><category><![CDATA[BuyersGuide]]></category><category><![CDATA[pressurec]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[Home]]></category><category><![CDATA[Gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[home]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[ElectronicEquipment,Instruments&Components]]></category><category><![CDATA[Home&Garden]]></category><category><![CDATA[ElectronicsAccessories]]></category><category><![CDATA[Lifestyle(houseAndHome)]]></category><category><![CDATA[DIY&HomeImprovement]]></category><category><![CDATA[OfficeElectronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology&Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=1600%2C900&amp;image_uri=https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-06/9006a1c0-98bf-11e9-9dfa-9fcc05ad7944&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=63c71f4bbb536daef0d2b78ab5c3e9f4c06d654f" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?crop=1600%2C900%2C0%2C0&amp;quality=85&amp;format=jpg&amp;resize=1600%2C900&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-06%2F9006a1c0-98bf-11e9-9dfa-9fcc05ad7944&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=63c71f4bbb536daef0d2b78ab5c3e9f4c06d654f" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's iPad Air drops to $500 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While Apple&#39;s entry-level iPad is ideal for those with strict budgets, we consider the iPad Air to be the best tablet in the company&#39;s lineup for most people. Those on the fence about shelling out $800 or more for an iPad Pro may find all their needs met by the $599 iPad Air. And now, thanks to a sale on Amazon, the tablet is cheaper than ever before. All five color options of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iPad Air" href="https://amzn.to/3zQsZMv">iPad Air</a> are down to $500, or $100 off their normal price. We&#39;ve seen this discount before a couple of times, but it&#39;s rare to see all colors on sale at once. While some like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:rose gold" href="https://amzn.to/3yOdQtB">rose gold</a> model have the $100 discount outright, others like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:silver" href="https://amzn.to/3zQsZMv">silver</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:blue" href="https://amzn.to/3l4wloK">blue</a> models are priced at $539, but an automatically applied coupon will bring the final price down to $500.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3zQsZMv" id="4a3d73b8955642ccbfe4c98ba13de2bb" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy iPad Air at Amazon - $500</a><p>The iPad Air earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-2020-review-130044886.html">score of 90</a> from us when it came out in October last year. Apple revamped the design to make it look more like the iPad Pros, featuring flat edges, a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display, a USB-C port for charging and a side button with TouchID technology built in. Inside is Apple&#39;s A14 Bionic chipset, which includes a six-core CPU and a four-core GPU, as well as WiFi 6 technology. Both of these things help the iPad Air feel much zippier than previous models, and you&#39;ll be able to reap the benefits for a long time each day as the Air&#39;s battery lasted between 10 and 12 hours in our testing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like the iPad Pro, the Air is compatible with the second-generation Apple Pencil and the Magic Keyboard. While those accessories drive the price of your whole system up, it also means that you could use the Air as a laptop replacement if you wish. However, there are some notable differences between the Air and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">latest iPad Pros</a>, namely the M1 chipset found in the latter. If you&#39;re going to push your machine to its limits on a regular basis, or just want a device that&#39;s slightly more future-proof, one of the new iPad Pros may be the way to go (the base <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:12.9-inch model" href="https://amzn.to/3jPIlvb">12.9-inch model</a> is $100 off right now, too). But most people will find that the iPad Air hits a sweet spot — it&#39;s speedy, lightweight and versatile, with just the right number of pro-level features for the price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-64gb-wifi-drops-to-500-all-color-options-on-sale-with-coupon-131523018.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff59f1ab-20b6-4881-8835-296df7a197db</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 13:15:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631019710</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T13:01:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/53aaa740-1301-11eb-b5fe-608fd08339b9" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/53aaa740-1301-11eb-b5fe-608fd08339b9" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dana Wollman/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A rear view of Apple's 2020 iPad Air.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPad Air]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[An 'Alan Wake' 4K remaster is coming to PlayStation, Xbox and PC this fall]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The future&#39;s looking rosy for Remedy Entertainment after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/control-spin-off-multiplayer-co-op-remedy-505-191228046.html">the success</a> of the excellent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/control"><em>Control</em></a>.

Mostly made out of soy protein and sunflower oil, the “Impossible Chicken Nuggets” will initially be available in select restaurants across the country, and then sold in grocery stores in the frozen aisle later this month.</p><p>Some of the restaurants that will be serving the Impossible Nuggets include David Chang’s Fuku in New York City, Marcus Samuelsson’s Red Rooster in Harlem and Miami, Sean Brock’s Joyland in Nashville, Tal Ronnen’s Crossroads Kitchen in Los Angeles and Traci Des Jardins’ El Alto Jr., a new pop-up at State Street Market in Los Altos, California. Regional chains such as LA-based Fatburger and Bay Area-based Gott’s Roadside will also add the nuggets to their menus this week.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I tried out the nuggets a few days ago at the Gott’s Roadside located in the Ferry Building in San Francisco. They were absolutely delicious, with a crispy well-seasoned breading and a juicy, moist interior. Fresh out of the fryer, they definitely tasted better than the “chik’n” nuggets from the likes of Gardein or Boca Burgers. They didn’t taste exactly like chicken either, but they were close enough that I didn’t mind. In fact, when dipped in various sauces (Gott’s serves them with ranch, ketchup and honey mustard), they were indistinguishable from the real deal.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7cae7260-0fb4-11ec-9747-1d684838675e" alt="Impossible Nuggets" data-uuid="7a48e51b-19d2-35f2-9786-44af52dda9db"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>According to Impossible, the nuggets have 40 percent less saturated fat and 25 percent less sodium than animal-based chicken nuggets. “Our technology platform allows us to recreate animal products across protein categories that outperform the animal versions in every way,” said President of Impossible Foods Dennis Woodside in a statement.</p><p>An Impossible spokesperson said that the nuggets are made from a combination of protein, fats and nutrients: “We use soy protein as our base to give the nuggets the right bite and to provide high quality protein that is important for our diet. After that, we use sunflower oil to create the fatty and juicy mouthfeel, simple nutrients such as amino acids and sugars that react during cooking to create our savory chicken flavor, and vitamins for nutrition. We also use common culinary ingredients such as starch and methylcellulose to hold the product together and retain moisture, which have the added benefit of more fiber compared to animal meat.”</p><p>Impossible certainly isn’t the first company to come out with faux chicken nuggets. Its main rival, <a href="https://www.beyondmeat.com/whats-new/beyond-chicken-tenders-available-for-the-first-time-at-restaurants-nationwide">Beyond</a>, debuted a line of “chicken” tenders a few months ago, and of course, companies like the aforementioned Gardein and Boca have been making faux nuggets for years. But seeing as chicken is a hugely popular protein source, having more companies produce plant-based alternatives for it is not a bad idea.</p><p>According to Impossible, the nuggets you get in the restaurant aren’t very different from the ones you’ll get in the grocery store. The primary difference is in the breading; the foodservice version is designed to be prepared in a commercial deep fryer, while the grocery store ones can be made in the oven, microwave or air fryer. The nuggets are already pre-cooked.</p><p>Speaking of the grocery store, the nuggets will be available in the frozen aisle of retailers such as Walmart, Albertsons, Kroger, Gelsons, Safeway, Shoprite and Giant locations across the country later this month. They’re priced at $7.99 (MSRP) for around 20 pieces (13.5 ounces), and come in a resealable freezer bag.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/impossible-chicken-nuggets-130035016.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">201dcc6b-f9ee-41a9-b29c-a0771b34a4cd</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 13:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631003726</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T08:35:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5d4efbb0-0fb4-11ec-9efb-95cb25c7e78e" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5d4efbb0-0fb4-11ec-9efb-95cb25c7e78e" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Impossible Nuggets]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Impossible Nuggets]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[WhatsApp may let you block your 'last seen' status contact by contact]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WhatsApp has come <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-eu-fine-facebook-data-sharing-144749929.htmlhttps://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-reworking-privacy-settings/">under fire</a> of late for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-privacy-policy-feature-205217967.html">privacy policies</a>, but an upcoming update will actually give you a bit more control over your privacy settings, according to <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-reworking-privacy-settings/"><em>WaBetaInfo.com</em></a><em>. </em></p><p>Several years back, WhatsApp introduced new privacy settings that let you change who could see your Profile Picture, About and Last Seen settings.

The automaker certainly has roles in mind for the Re:Move, however. It pictures the sled filling in for lighter delivery duties, such as online orders. The machine might also help in rural areas where there isn&#39;t much infrastructure for conventional vehicles. Don&#39;t be surprised if you see this or vehicles like it in villages where more &#39;conventional&#39; EVs just wouldn&#39;t be an option.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/polestar-re-move-working-prototype-electric-cargo-sled-090000981.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">05331d4d-9f5c-46ae-a68f-9dc75ac84bc6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631017726</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T12:28:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2e448280-0e7f-11ec-bffd-a4462c395ffd" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2e448280-0e7f-11ec-bffd-a4462c395ffd" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Polestar]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Polestar Re:Move electric cargo sled prototype]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Polestar Re:Move electric cargo sled prototype]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyundai's 'Hydrogen Vision 2040' includes trailer drones and a fuel cell supercar]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Despite its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-23-hydrogen-fuel-cell-explainer.html">problems</a> including inefficiency and pollution, Hyundai is betting big on hydrogen.

The trailers could even be divided into three containers, making the majority of the trip connected then breaking away into independent e-Bogies to the final destination.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/da514100-0fb8-11ec-be6f-4958f2388614" alt="Hyundai&#39;s &#39;Hydrogen Vision 2040&#39; includes trailer drones and a fuel cell supercar" data-uuid="b36a5bc0-313e-3999-bc5c-f9d32c0ed91d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hyundai</div></figure><p>The automaker is also interested in consumer tech, unveiling a 670 horsepower hydrogen plug-in hybrid sports car called the Vision FK concept developed in collaboration with Rimac.

Hyundai also expects the next-gen tech to cost around half of current fuel cells. They&#39;re also highly modular, meaning you can stack them to create &quot;Power Unit Modules&quot; with up to a megawatt of output &quot;ideal for emergency power systems for large ships or IT companies,&quot; Hyundai said. Another &quot;full-flat&quot; system keeps the stack height under 10 inches for installation in the floor or ceiling of buses, trains or trams.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/21cd93d0-0fb9-11ec-9f37-e29f3f316e06" alt="Hyundai&#39;s &#39;Hydrogen Vision 2040&#39; includes trailer drones and a fuel cell supercar" data-uuid="2a407ce7-58df-30eb-b390-bf66ad6fb1d3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hyundai</div></figure><p>&nbsp;One of the main problems with hydrogen power is the lack of infrastructure and Hyundai is addressing that with the H Moving Station concept. It&#39;s a heavy-duty vehicle designed to offer hydrogen refueling services in areas with limited infrastructure like rural areas or construction sites. It also unveiled the Rescue Hydrogen Generator Vehicle (RHGV). Rather than doling out hydrogen, it uses hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity for stranded EVs or to power homes in the event of an emergency outage.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this looks promising, but there&#39;s a reason most manufacturers are moving toward battery-powered EVs and away from hydrogen. Hydrogen is a highly explosive fuel that needs to be stored at very high pressures (either 350 or 700 bar), making infrastructure expensive and complex. On top of that, most hydrogen used in the US is created by reforming methane using steam, a process that produces <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/?sh=3a9679fc24bd">significant amounts</a> of CO2 that contributes to global warming.

Should it become law, the legislation could require <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> and other warehouse companies to make significant changes. Bill AB-701, which passed the State Assembly in May, would force warehouse operators like Amazon to be transparent about the quotas their workers are expected to meet.</p><p>&quot;The bill would provide that an employee shall not be required to meet a quota that prevents compliance with meal or rest periods, use of bathroom facilities or occupational health and safety laws,&quot; the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB701">legislative counsel&#39;s digest</a> for the proposed legislation reads.

Workers are &quot;responding to the speed at which a machine is moving,&quot; which leads to &quot;higher incidence of repetitive motions and thus repetitive injuries,&quot; Dr. Flores said.</p><p>Amazon announced some measures aimed at reducing warehouse injuries in May.

At the time, Amazon denied that was the case.</p><p>In August, a National Labor Relations Board official recommended that workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama hold another union vote. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union accused Amazon of violating labor laws by interfering with the process.

There&#39;s also a switch under the rear bench that lets rescue teams disconnect the battery.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, Renault put a QR code on the windscreen. The idea is that rescue teams can scan the code to see details about the car&#39;s structure. They can find out the locations of the battery and airbags, as well as information about where it&#39;s safe to cut into the vehicle. Renault says this information can help first responders save up to 15 minutes when attempting to free a crash victim, which could help save lives.</p><div id="c449bd457af94f1292448e4538da8d32"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA21?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IAA21</a> | Welcome to the future with our all new Megane E-TECH 100% <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/electric?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#electric</a>: <br>✔️&quot;Made in ElectriCity&quot; 🇫🇷<br>✔️Unique with an innovative design<br>✔️At the cutting edge of technology<br>✔️Sustainable <br>To know more: <a href="https://t.co/TCYUm0jIS8">https://t.co/TCYUm0jIS8</a><a href="https://t.co/s7oBp5lv4P">pic.twitter.com/s7oBp5lv4P</a></p>— Renault Group (@renaultgroup) <a href="https://twitter.com/renaultgroup/status/1434779997789691909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>No two EVs are built the same, and first responders won&#39;t necessarily know the intricacies of each vehicle. So, providing information about the Megane E-Tech Electric&#39;s structure using a QR code is a smart move that it&#39;d be nice to see more automakers adopt. The same goes for easy access to the battery to help put out fires faster.</p><p>The latest iteration of the Megane line is built on Renault&#39;s CMF-EV platform. For the body, designers took inspiration from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-renault-morphoz-concept-ev-transformer.html"><ins>Morphoz concept</ins></a> the company showed off last year. There are two powertrain options, as <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/renault-megane-e-tech-electric-battery-fire-safety-iaa/#ftag=CAD590a51e"><em><ins>CNET&#39;s Roadshow</ins></em></a> notes: a base model with 130 horsepower and a more advanced alternative with 215 hp and 221 pound-feet of torque.</p><p>You can choose between two battery packs as well. The 40 kWh option has a range of 186 miles (300 km), and the 60 kWh pack should get you up to 292 miles (470 km) of driving on a single charge, according to Renault. The company based the estimates on the European WLTP testing procedure. Plug the Megane E-Tech Electric into a 130 wW fast charging station, and you can add up to 186 miles of driving range in 30 minutes of charging time.</p><p>Elsewhere, the OpenR infotainment system is based on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%20automotive">Android Automotive OS</a>, so you&#39;ll have access to Google apps and Google Assistant. While you&#39;re on a longer trip, the system can help you locate charging stations that minimize your journey time, Renault says. The Megane E-Tech Electric orders open in February 2022, and sales start the following March.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/renault-megane-e-tech-electric-battery-fire-access-safety-163050987.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">26f75594-bb94-4c02-860e-828be2152224</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 16:30:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630944964</ingested><modified>2021-09-06T16:16:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Conglomerates]]></category><category><![CDATA[Utility Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c7d47c70-0f29-11ec-bff7-3352757a99e6" width="1400" height="709" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c7d47c70-0f29-11ec-bff7-3352757a99e6" width="1400" height="709" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Renault]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Renault Megane E-Tech Electric]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Renault Megane E-Tech Electric]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA says the Mars Perseverance rover has collected its first sample]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-perserverance-mars-rover-rock-sample-failure-153947031.html">failing</a> to capture a rock sample, NASA has <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1434376252819841026">confirmed</a> that Perseverance succeeded in its second attempt. The space agency has verified that a pencil-width core of rust-colored rock is safely trapped in the rover&#39;s sample tube tube, ready to be processed and sent back to Earth, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/nasa-perseverance-rover-grabs-first-mars-sample-that-could-be-sent-back-to-earth/"><em>CNET</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>After NASA initially thought it had nabbed the first sample last month, a subsequent check showed the sample tube empty. That created something of a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2287049-nasas-perseverance-rover-took-its-first-mars-sample-but-its-empty/">mystery</a>, with scientists wondering where the rock could have gone. Eventually, NASA determined that the particular sample it tried to collect was actually too powdery to be collected. &quot;The hardware performed as commanded, but the rock did not cooperate this time,&quot; JPL engineers said at the time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This time, NASA wasn&#39;t getting ahead of itself. While photos taken on September 1st shortly after the operation <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-perseverance-rover-successfully-cores-its-first-rock">clearly showed</a> rock in the collector, NASA wanted to be &quot;extra certain&quot; that it was successfully stored. Following an operation to percuss the drill bit (and ingest the sample), new images were taken, but the position of the sun made it difficult to see the rock.&nbsp;</p><div id="49ead5784f7f4d05a4aa1f86c341f251"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’ve got it! With better lighting down the sample tube, you can see the rock core I collected is still in there.

The images match earlier photos of a grind spot on a nearby sample section, revealing a rust-colored, possibly sedimentary rock that could show the presence of iron along with olivine and other minerals that may have precipitated from water, according to Arizona State University&#39;s Steven Ruff (via his YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fSCTMRifq4">Mars Guy</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Now, Perseverance must process, seal and and eventually store the sample somewhere on the surface of Mars. It will then repeat the process and collect as many samples as possible, leaving them scattered about the surface. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) will send a Martian lander and sample collection rover to the same location near Jezero Crater to gather up those tubes and place them into a rocket bound for Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>The only challenge is that said rover and rocket haven&#39;t been built yet and <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-exploration/missions/mars-sample-return/">don&#39;t even have</a> a finished design. However, the agencies involved plan to launch it to Mars by 2026, with arrival there by 2028. They don&#39;t expect to receive the samples until 2031, and suffice to say, all of those phases of the Perseverance project will be a huge challenge.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-confirms-that-perseverance-successfully-cored-its-first-rock-153007472.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a218d8b4-a60e-4c02-b588-602f6bbde0d3</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 15:30:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630940304</ingested><modified>2021-09-06T14:58:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7366a350-0f1c-11ec-bf58-8520f9bf7614" width="1608" height="956" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7366a350-0f1c-11ec-bf58-8520f9bf7614" width="1608" height="956" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA successfully samples Perseverance core]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA successfully samples Perseverance core]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon is running a Labor Day sale on Kindles and Fire tablets]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> is offering discounts on a swathe of Kindles and Fire tablets for Labor Day.

The rounded lines meant to evoke the classic &#39;70s VW van have been squared off, and the bulgy fenders are considerably less so. It also appears, though it&#39;s hard to confirm with the camouflage, that VW has changed the concept&#39;s funky rear window configuration.

Meanwhile, driver information appears on a heads-up display along the entire width of the windshield, while control comes via a pair of steering-wheel mounted touchpads with the same crystal appearance. Each seat has its own &quot;dedicated sound zone&quot; that allows passengers to listen to their own music — a techie, but rather antisocial touch.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cf61be0-0eed-11ec-b5f8-f9beb0bad1df" alt="BMW&#39;s &#39;recyclable&#39; i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface" data-uuid="e7c62c1d-ed44-3b0e-8bb2-8114aa8a3570"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>While the design is fairly bonkers, the i Vision Circular concept does offer some practical ideas.

A group of 11 House Republicans has <a href="https://biggs.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-biggs-sends-letter-companies-condemning-democrats-request-private">sent letters</a> to the leaders of 13 tech companies threatening legal action if they comply with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-select-committee-social-media-company-records-demand-211356022.html">request for records</a> related to the January 6th Capitol attack. However, there&#39;s one major problem. The letter to Yahoo (Engadget&#39;s parent company) is addressed to Marissa Mayer, who hasn&#39;t been CEO of the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-13-verizon-yahoo-acquisition-complete.html">since 2017</a>. That&#39;s four years ago, folks — she&#39;s not exactly a recent departure.</p><p>The representatives&#39; other letters appear to have been free of snafus on their way to Amazon, AOL (which Apollo acquired alongside Yahoo), Apple, AT&amp;T, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Snap, T-Mobile, Twitter, US Cellular and Verizon (Engadget&#39;s former parent). However, the congresspeople appear to be slightly behind the times as well. None of the letters went to Reddit, Telegram, TikTok and other key firms asked to produce records. The list appears to be a who&#39;s-who of tech from several years ago.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We laugh, but the slip-up is also a reminder that Congress&#39; general lack of tech knowledge creates problems, whether it&#39;s a letter to a long-gone CEO or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html">proposed law changes</a> that could produce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-17-safe-sex-workers-study-act.html">easily foreseen complications</a>.

There are no mentions of when it might ship. However, it said this was a &quot;near-production&quot; design that would go through the same Schöckl mountain torture test as its ancestors.

Mercedes has finally <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/The-essential-information-and-innovations.xhtml?oid=51155343">detailed</a> the EQE (second from top), its electric equivalent to the E-Class. It appears at first blush to be a shrunken version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-first-drive-video-220117807.html">EQS luxury sedan</a>, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. You&#39;re still getting a highly aerodynamic design and long range (a claimed 410 miles on the not-quite-realistic WLTP cycle), just in a smaller, CLS-sized design that should be easier to navigate around town.</p><p>The EQE 350 launch model will include a rear motor, a 90kW battery and reach 60MPH in a claimed 5.6 seconds. Performance versions are in the pipeline, according to Mercedes. However, the EQS&#39; signature dash-length &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html">Hyperscreen</a>&quot; is strictly optional here — you&#39;ll normally get a more conventional 12.8-inch OLED infotainment display.</p><p>The EQE will have a &quot;staggered&quot; worldwide launch starting in mid-2022. Mercedes hasn&#39;t divulged pricing, although we&#39;d expect it to cost more than the $54,250 of the combustion engine E-Class.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a84781a0-0e6f-11ec-9ef4-8415bda92ad3" alt="Mercedes-Maybach Concept EQS electric SUV" data-uuid="59e75456-533d-319a-8ed5-b25f48aec1cc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daimler</div></figure><p>And yes, there are already <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51166803&amp;ls=L3NlYXJjaHJlc3VsdC9zZWFyY2hyZXN1bHQueGh0bWw_c2VhcmNoVHlwZT1mbGV4JnNlYXJjaFN0cmluZz1OTVNfRmxleFNlYXJjaF9DdXJyZW50TmV3cyZyZXN1bHRJbmZvVHlwZUlkPTQwNjI2JmZsZXhJbmZvVHlwZXM9NDA2MjYlMkM0MDYzMA!!&amp;rs=2">ultra-luxurious</a> and <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51165592&amp;ls=L3NlYXJjaHJlc3VsdC9zZWFyY2hyZXN1bHQueGh0bWw_c2VhcmNoVHlwZT1mbGV4JnNlYXJjaFN0cmluZz1OTVNfRmxleFNlYXJjaF9DdXJyZW50TmV3cyZyZXN1bHRJbmZvVHlwZUlkPTQwNjI2JmZsZXhJbmZvVHlwZXM9NDA2MjYlMkM0MDYzMA!!&amp;rs=1">high-performance</a> versions of the EQS. A Mercedes-Maybach Concept EQS (second from bottom) offers an electric SUV for customers who&#39;d rather have a chauffeur for their eco-friendly transportation. Another near-production vehicle, it takes on the signature two-tone styling and other cues of a Maybach along with lounge-like rear seating and a Maybach-oriented Hyperscreen up front. Mercedes was once again shy on performance and release dates, although it noted the related EQS SUV is expected to net around a 373-mile range and go into production in 2022.</p><p>If you&#39;re more inclined to take the helm, the Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ (bottom) is the brand&#39;s first AMG-badged EV and includes custom motors that promise up to 761HP, 742lb/ft of torque and a 0-60MPH time of 3.4 seconds — brisk for a large luxury sedan. You&#39;ll also find an AMG GT-derived air suspension and rear-wheel steering. You won&#39;t see too many visual differences, although the unique rims and optional carbon ceramic rotors will make your go-fast intentions clear. Mercedes hasn&#39;t outlined pricing or release dates here, either, although it&#39;s safe to presume this will make the regular EQS line seem frugal.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e55e0440-0e71-11ec-8fcd-5f4b25db4e66" alt="Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ electric sedan" data-uuid="4b79ddda-e973-37ec-88b2-6f96f87a1753"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daimler</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-concept-eqg-eqe-175231108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e686102-4889-42d1-aa22-3e94eff708d9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 17:52:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630937257</ingested><modified>2021-09-06T14:07:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/524ccd50-0e6a-11ec-8963-519dca8aa199" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/524ccd50-0e6a-11ec-8963-519dca8aa199" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daimler]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz Concept EQG electric SUV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz Concept EQG electric SUV]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
