That&#39;s the lowest price we&#39;ve seen for the wireless earbuds, which originally retailed for $179 and which Apple has been selling for $150 over the past few days. While the model is currently in stock, make sure to check your estimated delivery dates before you decide to buy it as a Christmas gift, because it may arrive after the holidays even if you purchase it right now.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ywCWyO" id="8a99d255e35b4d708e2b5f3c404a8700" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy New Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) at Amazon - $140</a><p>If you don&#39;t mind the possibility that your order might arrive after the holidays and have been looking to buy a pair of AirPods in the first place, the third-gen model is a great buy. While it still doesn&#39;t come with the Pro&#39;s silicone buds, it represents a complete redesign for the product line. In our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">review</a>, where we gave it a score of 88, we found it more comfortable than its predecessors due to its new &quot;contoured design.&quot; It&#39;s shorter than previous models and can direct sounds better into your ear, leading to massive improvements to its audio quality.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple also paired a custom driver with a high-dynamic-range amplifier to produce &quot;rich consistent bass&quot; and &quot;crisp, clean&quot; sounds that improve audio quality even further, making it more immersive than before. And, thanks to the H1 chip, the third-gen AirPods feature Adaptive EQ, spatial audio, one-touch fast pairing and always-on Siri. Finally, we praised the model for its battery life: The earbuds themselves can last for six hours, and the case can extend your listening time for up to 30 hours total.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

The <a href="https://www.media.stellantis.com/em-en/citroen/press/ready-for-adventure-citroen-my-ami-buggy-concept-embodies-ami-s-vision-of-leisure?adobe_mc_ref=">My Ami Buggy</a> is based on the Ami we all <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hands-on-citroen-ami-ev-133032057.html">know and love</a>, but adds some practical and stylistic touches like wider knobby tires, an LED light bar and removable canvas doors.&nbsp;</p><p>The buggy is mainly a way for Citroën&#39;s designers to show off their chops by adding &quot;stylish attributes to assert its intrepid and friendly backpacker personality,&quot; according to the company. As such, they drew inspiration from things like construction games, industrial design and fashion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="29ec319dae494199a7609f7eb684cae4"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuXIh2dTA8k?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>To be sure, it looks like your ten-year-old&#39;s idea of a buggy, assuming the kid had some design talent. The khaki, black and yellow color scheme is the first attention-grabbing feature, giving it an outdoorsy camouflage feel and yet high visibility.</p><p>Another key feature is the doors, or lack thereof. The regular ones have been replaced by removable canvas doors with zippers, bringing some much-needed air circulation and buggy allure. The knobbier and wider tires will let you take it onto rougher roads, though remember that ground clearance isn&#39;t amazing. It also has headlight protectors and a spare knobby tire mounted on the roof that &quot;emphasize the concept&#39;s spirit of adventure&quot; and ratchet up the cuteness factor.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/16d0b580-5e64-11ec-afbb-a3e6e165a820" style="height:1240;width:2000;" alt="Citro&#xeb;n has transformed its tiny Ami EV into an adorable buggy concept" data-uuid="95246f38-969d-35ff-8bd8-57080f710d89"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Copyright maison-vignaux @ Continental Productions</div></figure><p>Other additions include an LED lightbar, removable &quot;nomadic speaker,&quot; a roof cap to protect against the sun and a graphics package that includes the words &quot;Pilot&quot; and &quot;01&quot; on the driver&#39;s seat and &quot;Copilot&quot; and &quot;02&quot; on the passenger seat. It also offers thicker memory foam in the seats, new storage bins on the dashboard and even a range of luggage designed to &quot;fit perfectly into the vehicle&#39;s interior spaces,&quot; according to Citroën. Other features like  smartphone clamps, bottle holders and more were all built using 3D printing so that they can be reproduced on demand.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder, the Ami can hit a top speed of 28 MPH and go 44 miles on its 5.5 kWh battery. It&#39;s also legal for teenagers 14 and older to drive in France and elsewhere in Europe. The company&#39;s designers must have had a lot of fun with the My Ami Buggy concept, but there&#39;s no word yet on whether Citroën will ever build and sell it — though the kid in all of us certainly hopes so.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/citroen-has-transformed-its-ami-ev-into-an-adorable-buggy-concept-123517763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">73b2cac1-ff3c-4cf2-96eb-8965d994e282</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 12:35:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639655484</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T11:51:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/10f6e1a0-5e5c-11ec-bffa-ca2d017112ab" width="1170" height="740" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/10f6e1a0-5e5c-11ec-bffa-ca2d017112ab" width="1170" height="740" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Citroen]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Citroen has transformed its tiny Ami EV into an adorable buggy concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Citroen has transformed its tiny Ami EV into an adorable buggy concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Oppo's take on folding smartphones doesn't look so huge]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Still not sold on foldable smartphones?

The move comes shortly after the same publication <a href="https://sea.ign.com/destiny/179904/news/the-battle-for-bungies-soul-inside-the-studios-struggle-for-a-better-work-culture">released</a> a report with accounts by former and current Bungie employees painting a picture of a workplace culture that&#39;s both toxic and sexist. In some instances, HR personnel were reportedly unwilling to help complainants and actively protected harmful individuals.</p><p>In her email sent to employees and seen by <em>IGN</em>, d&#39;Hondt said she wants to do &quot;everything in [her] power to make sure everyone who works [at Bungie] has a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment.&quot; It&#39;s necessary, she added, for the company&#39;s HR team to move forward with membership &quot;largely comprised of people new to Bungie.&quot; d&#39;Hondt didn&#39;t say who would be replacing her, but she told employees in the email that the HR team needs &quot;to be trusted to be [their] advocates — not labeled as &#39;enablers&#39; or seen as company resources who provide bad actors with safe harbor.&quot; It&#39;s also unclear if d&#39;Hondt is leaving the video game developer completely or just moving to a different role.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The former HR head mentioned about her own experience with an abuser at the company, as well: A male executive whom she thought was her friend. While she didn&#39;t name her abuser, she said Bungie eventually fired him. She concluded:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I am proud of the work I did at this company. I believe I made recommendations that were in the best interest of our people and in service of the company we wish to become. I also believe we made some mistakes, and that to become the better version of ourselves — the company I know we can be – we have to acknowledge and confront them, in good faith, and grow together.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While <em>IGN&#39;s</em> report showed the company in a less-than-flattering light, it also showed how the studio is struggling to shake its toxic culture in an effort to foster a better one. In response to it, company CEO Pete Parsons <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-responds-ign-report-211235404.html">published</a> an apology letter, admitting that Bungie&#39;s &quot;actions or, in some cases, inactions, caused these people pain.&quot; He also talked about the changes the company has made over the past few years to make it a better place for employees, including removing bad actors irrespective of their &quot;tenure, seniority or interpersonal relationships.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bungie-head-of-hr-steps-down-103523997.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0fc4e1d3-c403-497b-bbf4-0389865a29a7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 10:35:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639652434</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T11:00:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1bf9bc80-5e57-11ec-a737-f7b93997d5d5" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1bf9bc80-5e57-11ec-a737-f7b93997d5d5" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chesnot via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 31:  Gamers play the video game 'Destiny 2' developed by Bungie Studios and published by Activision during the 'Paris Games Week' on October 31, 2017 in Paris, France.

The Arrival Car, as it is known, is designed, first and foremost, to be used by rideshare drivers during their working day.</p><p>Much as the company doesn’t want to call it a taxi, this is more or less what the Arrival Car is, an electric update to the London black cab for cities of the future. But with a number of tweaks that mean it’s smaller and more efficient than current cars, but still has buckets of room inside.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ab9f6c1f715347caa8443b4baaaf0f17"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ys3A8wVEjVQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The (capital-C) Car has been teased for a while, and back in May, Arrival announced that it had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-arrival-custom-ev-taxis-094528261.html">teamed up with Uber</a> to create a “purpose-built vehicle for ride-hailing.” It’s a project with an ambitious deadline, too, with the first models expected to roll off the production line in Q3, 2023.</p><p>Visiting Arrival’s Oxfordshire HQ, I was able to look at, and sit in, the Alpha prototype, but the company is a little leery about sharing too many images of the same. That’s, in part, because it doesn’t feel the first model, built in about six months, is fully representative of what’s to come. I wasn’t allowed to take images of the car in all of its glory, and instead was supplied with a mixture of renders and close-up shots of various components.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/571335e0-5dc5-11ec-bffd-fe90298aa880" alt="Wheel" data-uuid="a851d8b4-12d6-3552-a77a-16d1b96ecdfd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arrival</div></figure><p>Part of the reason that Arrival feels confident that it can turn a car around in such a short space of time is that it’s standing very much on its own shoulders. After all, the Car uses the same integrated EV skate platform that was developed for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-ups-arrival-electric-trucks-order-investment.html">the van</a> and the bus. It means that Arrival can, effectively, cut its skate to the right size and plonk any cabin structure on top.</p><p>The Arrival Car is <em>deeply uncool</em>, a box on wheels with an emphasis on maximizing the internal space for passengers. It has the same silhouette as a French-made minivan; you could easily imagine a line of these parked outside a Saturday-morning under 15’s soccer match. But, because it wholly rejects the need to be aesthetic for the sake of aesthetics, it’s also <em>quite cool</em>.</p><p>And despite the sci-fi styling, there’s something quite humane about its design, something quite organic. Because the propulsion is on the floor, there’s no need for a pronounced bonnet, so the windshield just melts into the chassis. There’s a cambered glass roof stretching over the cabin, making the interior space airy and roomy.</p><p>One big focus, naturally, was on maximizing the interior space and legroom, and I’ve seen visitor centers that are more cramped. Despite sitting on (roughly) the same footprint as a VW Golf, the Car probably has more legroom than a (famously-roomy) London Black Cab. The front passenger seat can also be folded down and pushed slightly forward, should you need extra room. The height, too, means that you can easily step up and into this vehicle rather than awkwardly crouching down, which should help folks with mobility issues.</p><p>The only issue with this first version, which is likely to change in the second prototype, is the luggage space. This first model has a fairly small luggage compartment, designed for two large and two small suitcases and little else. But Tom Elvidge, EVP of Vehicle Platforms, believes that changes will be made to improve this for the second prototype.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/40adb870-5dc5-11ec-bcff-fbe9200d22a2" alt="Render of the Arrival Gamma Car" data-uuid="e48f1784-ca79-3639-b0aa-e51f59090e13"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arrival</div></figure><p>Arrival’s custom software platform drives the system, and the Car has a Tesla Model 3-esque 13-inch screen mounted in the middle of the dashboard. That’s good for localization, given that this will need to be made available in left and right-hand-drive models. But it also helps clear out some of the clutter that rideshare drivers sometimes have cluttering up their view.</p><p>Another driver-focused benefit is the fact that the Car has been designed to be comfortable but not full of delicate materials. Of course, a lot of this remains in flux, but the prototype uses brightly colored woven fabrics for seat covers and something spill-resistant on the floor. Given the risks of passengers dirtying up the vehicle, reducing the amount of time drivers can be on the road, ease of cleaning is a key priority.</p><p>It’s early days, and Arrival has still got the better part of two years to answer many of the key questions we have about this vehicle. Facts about battery capacity, range, speed and cost are all left blank since the company is, right now, focused on ironing out the design. We know that it won’t be speed-capped to only go around city streets, given that 10 percent of rideshare journeys are to the airports. And that it has to at least pass as a family hatchback for when drivers aren’t working and want to use the car as their own ride.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1784c380-5dc5-11ec-9def-dd4ec78e6404" alt="Extreme close-up of the new Arrival Car prototype" data-uuid="09e9c906-10e2-3e1d-a38d-0e3cfe5581be"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arrival</div></figure><p>And, of course, the cost will be a big factor to help drivers ditch their existing vehicles. Arrival thinks that many of the innovations it has already developed will help it there, but there are no concrete figures yet. Given how many taxi fleets adopted Priuses (and other Toyota hybrids) to help squeeze more range from their fuel budgets, you can imagine this becoming a hit.</p><p>What we do know is that Arrival’s EV platform makes for an extraordinary driving experience and one that’s very fun to use. I was allowed to drive one of the test vans around the company’s car park-cum-test-track and it’s wild. This thing is a heavy-ass UPS-style package van that drives with the ease and precision of a go-kart. I’m sure that plenty of professional drivers will enjoy the feeling of connection to the road that this particular system offers.</p><p>For now, Arrival is working on identifying which elements from this first model don’t work, and refining them for the second prototype. There’s plenty of work to do between now and the end of 2023, however, and so we’ll wait and see how this shakes out in the end.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arrival-car-first-look-prototype-090031725.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">da5eb99f-ce43-4116-8f50-bd37b9426e42</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 09:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639645520</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T09:05:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/941b3660-5dc3-11ec-bfb5-901741751b37" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/941b3660-5dc3-11ec-bfb5-901741751b37" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arrival]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Initial render of the Arrival Car]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arrival Car (render)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Huawei's foldable P50 Pocket phone revealed in 'Harper's Bazaar']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Huawei is no stranger to foldable mobile devices and had released three over the past few years: The Mate X, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-24-huawei-mate-xs-hands-on-release-date-price.html">Mate Xs</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-reveals-the-mate-x-2-foldable-phone-141434144.html">Mate X2</a>, which is the most recent model launched in February. All of those are similar to the Samsung Galaxy Fold in that they&#39;re devices that fold vertically and are the size of a small tablet when unfolded. Recently, however, Huawei has started teasing a foldable phone that&#39;s more akin to the Samsung Galaxy Flip, and a fashion shoot published by <em>Harper&#39;s Bazaar China </em>has <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/L6h3qlP5V?ref=collection&amp;type=comment&amp;jumpfrom=weibocom#_rnd1639633936926">revealed</a> what the device looks like.&nbsp;</p><p>The model, called Huawei P50 Pocket, is prominently featured in a pictorial with Chinese actress and singer Guan Xiaotong. It looks fairly large, based on the photos posted on Weibo, with a circular external display that can show the time, notifications and a view of what you&#39;re capturing with the camera if the phone is flipped shut. P50 Pocket&#39;s external display is right next to the camera, and according to <a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/huawei-p50-pocket-harper-s-bazaar-teaser-062427696.html"><em>Engadget Chinese</em></a>, its fingerprint reader is located along the edges of the device.

Audi didn’t share many details on the prototype, but as you can see from the photo above, it pulls more than a few design cues from the company’s iconic Sport Quattro S1.

The lower center of gravity could also make cornering a lot tighter. One thing we’ll have to see is if the  S1 Hoonitron replicates the sound a rev limiter makes in a traditional internal combustion engine car.

You might still use Via to arrange pickups (including for paratransit) or check schedules, but you won&#39;t have much more control and will likely share the vehicle.</p><p>The company isn&#39;t shy about its reasoning: its public transportation business is more successful. Via chief Daniel Ramot told <em>Bloomberg</em> his firm&#39;s transit business is &quot;growing quickly,&quot; and it&#39;s a more reliable revenue stream thanks to long-term contracts.

They have far larger slices of personal ride hailing than Via, however. Even if Via were to remain committed to personal rides, it would be competing for a small slice of a market with two clear incumbents.

Shops in Annapolis (Annapolis Mall), Miami (Brickell City Centre) and the Canadian capital Ottawa (Rideau Centre) will remain closed until either December 18th or December 19th.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear how many employees developed COVID-19 at the affected stores. In a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Apple reiterated a prior statement indicating that it &quot;regularly monitor[s]&quot; pandemic conditions and has a &quot;comprehensive&quot; store safety initiative that includes daily health checks, masks, extra cleaning and paid sick leave. All workers will have to take COVID-19 tests before they return.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s no certainty closures like this will continue in the near future. With rising infection rates and uncertainty around the new coronavirus&#39; Omicron variant, however, it won&#39;t be surprising if there are more until this latest wave dies down.</p><p>The move also underscores the persistent risks for retail staff at many stores, not just Apple&#39;s. While many retail employees have to wear masks and share their health statuses, they can&#39;t necessarily avoid sick customers —and there are concerns Apple store managers may have pressured subordinates to come in despite showing COVID-19 symptoms. Stores can minimize risks, but they can&#39;t completely avoid them so long as the disease persists.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-closes-stores-over-covid-19-surge-213559316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">38c6791d-8b95-40d3-bf37-9978bcf384e6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 21:35:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639604165</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T21:36:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7fb96dd0-5de7-11ec-bf37-d28bfc787d2f" width="3600" height="2403" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7fb96dd0-5de7-11ec-bf37-d28bfc787d2f" width="3600" height="2403" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Johnny Louis via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIAMI BEACH, FLORIDA - JULY 24: A Exterior view of a empty apple store at Lincoln Road Mall amid a curfew looming at Miami Dade and Broward County due the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) spike in South Florida on July 24, 2020 in Miami Beach, Florida.

The game developer has <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto">revealed</a> plans for a <em>Splinter Cell</em> remake that aims to recreate the stealth action of the early games while embracing modern technology.</p><p>The project will use the Snowdrop engine present in newer games like <em>The Division 2</em> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-release-date-202716664.html"><em>Avatar</em> title</a>, but you&#39;ll play in small, linear environments rather than Ubi&#39;s signature (and frequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/far-cry-6-release-date-gameplay-trailer-182030303.html">formulaic</a>) open-world spaces. The company wants to meet present-day gameplay expectations, but is also aware that early <em>Splinter Cell</em> was appealing precisely because it rewarded truly stealthy players who demonstrated patience, intelligence and methodical planning. Don&#39;t expect to survive a full-fledged gunfight, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s clearly too soon for Ubisoft to provide a release date for the remake, but the Toronto studio is helming the effort with a mix of veterans from previous <em>Splinter Cell</em> games and fresher faces that will include some new hires. Whether or not the team succeeds isn&#39;t clear. Ubisoft Toronto&#39;s one and only <em>Splinter Cell</em> game was <em>Blacklist</em>, which was well-received but not as revered as the original. The Toronto branch is also still grappling with the consequences of Ubi&#39;s misconduct scandals — VP and <em>Blacklist</em> co-director Maxime Béland <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-vice-president-resigns-assault-accusations-175852405.html">resigned following assault allegations</a>.</p><p>The gameplay promises might bode well if you were worried the remake would stray too far from what made <em>Splinter Cell</em> great, though. And crucially, this could be the launchpad for a true revival. The game&#39;s creative lead, Chris Auty, characterized the re-do as a &quot;solid base&quot; for the future of the franchise. Even if you don&#39;t like the thought of a rehash, this could lead to true sequels to a series that many had previously written off.</p><div id="8bb840cf73174e718a8f0b58a5f988e2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HH1_ZCSf_HY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/splinter-cell-remake-ubisoft-191516206.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2ded3661-be01-4917-a3f2-a65a3a6575c6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:15:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639594172</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T18:49:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4eeb31a0-5dd0-11ec-b7fa-893ac2f8eee7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4eeb31a0-5dd0-11ec-b7fa-893ac2f8eee7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sam Fisher in 'Splinter Cell' remake teaser]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sam Fisher in 'Splinter Cell' remake teaser]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The entry-level 2022 Polestar 2 will have an EPA-estimated range of 270 miles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html">2022 lineup</a>, Volvo subsidiary Polestar introduced a new single-motor variant of its Polestar 2 electric sedan. If you were waiting on an EPA estimate before reserving one, wait no more. You can expect to get about 270 miles of range on a single charge from the car’s 75 kWh battery, Polestar announced on Wednesday.</p><p>That puts the FWD model in the company of vehicles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">Volkswagen ID.4</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-3-2021-refresh-offers-more-range-and-other-improvements-114539380.html">Model 3</a>. With the entry-level models of those two cars, you can expect 249 miles and 263 miles of range, respectively. That’s not bad given the Polestar 2’s $47,200 starting price, but not nearly as good as the 303 miles of EPA-rated range Hyundai will offer with the $44,875 version of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-300-mile-ioniq-5-crossover-ev-makes-its-official-north-american-debut-190054008.html">Ioniq 5</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The automaker also announced today it’s rolling out an over-the-air update for all Polestar 2 vehicles. The new software allows you to schedule when you want your car to charge, so that you can take advantage of off-peak pricing. The update also includes refinements for the car’s driver-assist systems. In the coming months, Polestar plans to release a software upgrade that will allow owners of the dual-motor Polestar 2 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-over-the-air-update-torque-horsepower-acceleration-151000748.html">unlock additional torque and horsepower</a> from their car for a fee.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-epa-270-miles-range-190006554.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7480b5a5-358b-4663-9be9-17b1ae6d03fd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 19:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639596817</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T19:33:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a30f5790-5ddd-11ec-afd9-cbbb67edc642" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a30f5790-5ddd-11ec-afd9-cbbb67edc642" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Paul Barshon / Beadyeye]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Polestar 2 EV parked on a rocky road with stone and dirt cliffs in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Polestar 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘OlliOlli World’ arrives on February 8th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-indie-game-showcase-how-to-watch-155651019.html"><ins>Indie World Showcase</ins></a> stream has wrapped up, and while there was unfortunately no word about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-26-hollow-knight-silksong-switch-hands-on.html"><em><ins>Hollow Knight: Silksong</ins></em></a>, Nintendo has revealed more details about other games that are coming to Switch.

The change will allow researchers to report both bugs that could enable scraping activity, as well as previously scraped data that has already been published online.</p><p>In a blog post, Meta says it believes it is the first to launch a bug bounty program to specifically target scraping activity. “We&#39;re looking to find vulnerabilities that enable attackers to bypass scraping limitations to access data at greater scale than what we initially intended,” Security Engineering Manager Dan Gurfinkle told reports during a briefing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Data scraping is different than other “malicious” activity Meta tracks as it uses automated tools to mass-collect personal information from users’ profiles, such as email addresses, phone numbers, profile photos and other details. Even though users often willingly share this information on their public Facebook profiles, scrapers can expose these details more widely, such as publishing the information in searchable databases.</p><p>It can also be difficult for Meta to combat this activity. For example, in April the personal information of more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-533-million-user-personal-data-leak-180156777.html"><ins>500 million</ins></a> Facebook users was published on a forum. In that case, the actual data scraping had occurred years prior, and the company had already addressed the underlying flaw. But there was little it could do once the data started circulating online.

The studio, which was founded this year by <em>Threes</em> designer Asher Vollmer, has successfully unionized with CODE-CWA — the Communication Workers of America&#39;s Campaign to Organize Digital Employees.</p><p>Operating out of various locations in the US and Canada, the all-remote team of 13 is an unusual case for a few reasons. Foremost, about half of the bargaining unit are independent contractors – typically the exact sort of workers left out of, or deemed ineligible for, a union.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And while much of the push to unionize digital workspaces in recent years has focused on curbing abuses by management and pay imbalances, Vodeo&#39;s does not appear to stem from a need to course-correct away from imminent disaster. Rather, their desire to unionize seems rooted in wanting to maintain an equitable workplace. “They’re not organizing because there’s some big scary boss, like Bobby Kotick or someone,” campaign lead for CODE-CWA Emma Kinema told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22834924/vodeo-games-first-video-game-union-north-america-code-cwa">Polygon</a>. “They’re organizing because they care so much about the work they do, and they want more of a say over how it’s done — the conditions in which they work to actually make those games that they care about.”</p><p>As Kinema alludes to, the games industry has been going through a period of great internal upheaval. Whistleblowers within <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/18/games-firm-rocksteady-accused-of-lack-of-action-on-harassment">Rocksteady</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22274969/riot-games-lawsuit-gender-discrimination-sexual-harassment-ceo">Riot</a>, <a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/brazil-wildlife-report-harassment/">Wildlife</a> and <a href="https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/game-workers-unite-quantic-dream-1203207491/">Quantic Dream</a>, have detailed harassment and discrimination. There has also been increased pushback against industry practices such as “crunch,” in which studios demand herculean overtime hours from staff in order to hit targeted release dates. Some Activision-Blizzard workers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/11/16/activision-blizzard-kotick-walkout/">walked off the job</a>, demanding among other things, the resignation of their CEO, Bobby Kotick. They&#39;ve set up a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/abk-strike-fund">strike fund</a> and are in the midst of their own union drive.&nbsp;</p><p>“All workers deserve a union and a say in how their workplace is run, no matter where they work, what their employment status is, or what kind of conditions they work under,&quot; Myriame Lachapelle, a producer at Vodeo Games, wrote in a statement to press. &quot;We have been inspired by the growing worker organizing within the gaming industry and hope we can set a new precedent for industry-wide standards that will better our shared working conditions and inspire others to do the same.”</p><p>Vodeo released its first game, the <em>Peggle</em>-like RPG <em>Beast Breaker, </em>in September to largely positive reviews. It&#39;s available for PC, Mac and Switch.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/first-games-union-vodeo-cwa-north-america-165537268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6ad61447-0d23-4acb-acee-adf33ea81e00</guid><dc:creator>Bryan Menegus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 16:55:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639587707</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T17:02:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Bryan Menegus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/61089100-5dc3-11ec-baff-bfc3a026091c" width="2000" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/61089100-5dc3-11ec-baff-bfc3a026091c" width="2000" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vodeo Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[from the youtube trailer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beast Breaker screengrab]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SiriusXM sued over lack of podcast transcripts for the hard of hearing]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SiriusXM has been accused of doing too little to make its podcasts accessible.

You may well see more complaints in the future.</p><p>The lawsuit is, effectively, a request for podcasts service operators to rethink accessibility. NAD and DRA want equal access to be a given, not a nice-to-have extra.

Visit now and you&#39;ll only see <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-only-siri-only-plan-ios-15-2-183416178.html">iOS 15.2&#39;s</a> optional nude photo detection in Messages and intervention when people search for child exploitation terms.</p><p>It&#39;s not certain why Apple has pulled the references. We&#39;ve asked Apple for comment. This doesn&#39;t necessarily represent a full retreat from CSAM scanning, but it at least suggests a rollout isn&#39;t imminent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Apple was already scanning iCloud Photos uploads for hashes of known CSAM, the change would have moved those scans to the devices themselves to ostensibly improve privacy. If iCloud Photos was enabled and enough hashes appeared in a local photo library, Apple would decrypt the relevant &quot;safety vouchers&quot; (included with every image) and manually review the pictures for a potential report to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. That, in turn, could get police involved.</p><p>The CSAM detection feature drew flak from privacy advocates. Apple stressed the existence of multiple safeguards, such as a high threshold for reviews and its reliance on hashes from multiple child safety organizations rather than government. However, there were concerns the company might still produce false positives or expand scanning under pressure from authoritarian regimes. Moreover, the only way to prevent on-device scans was to avoid using iCloud Photos altogether — you had to accept Apple&#39;s new approach or lose a valuable cloud service.</p><p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-features-csam-delay-132534290.html">delayed the rollout</a> indefinitely to &quot;make improvements&quot; following the criticism. However, it&#39;s now clear the company isn&#39;t in a rush to complete those changes, and doesn&#39;t want to set expectations to the contrary. If local CSAM scanning reappears, it might take a long while (Apple expected a return in the &quot;coming months&quot;) or bear only a partial resemblance to the original system.</p><p><strong>Update 12/15 10:55AM ET:</strong> An Apple spokesperson reiterated the company&#39;s statement when announced the delay in September, indicating that its stance hadn&#39;t changed since then.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-csam-mentions-on-website-151958410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">86b61e79-629a-4511-935d-ae523ce4187a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 15:19:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639583766</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T15:56:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f42439e0-1eed-11ec-8b73-9a109939072e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f42439e0-1eed-11ec-8b73-9a109939072e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 in Starlight color]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 in Starlight color]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
