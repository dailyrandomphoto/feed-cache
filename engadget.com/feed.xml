But it turns out Google didn&#39;t appreciate its ability to rip music out of YouTube. The company has sent a cease and desist letter to Groovy Bot&#39;s owners, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"><em>The Verge reports</em></a>, asking them to shut down within seven days. They&#39;re not putting up a fight: Groovy Bot will officially go offline on August 30th.</p><p>A YouTube spokesperson noted that Groovy Bot violated its terms of service, particularly because it modified the way YouTube worked and charge for the privilege. If Groovy Bot were merely free, it may have been able to live on. But it also offers a premium subscription starting at $3.99 a month, which unlocks a slew of useful features.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The bot is currently installed on over 16 million Discord servers and has reportedly amassed <a href="https://tinelund.dk/groovy-bot-the-best-music-bot-for-discord-groovy-15/">more than 250 million users</a>. Groovy Bot owner Nik Ammerlaan tells <em>The Verge</em> that around 98 percent of played tracks came through YouTube (naturally, because it&#39;s free). With one bot down, there&#39;s a good chance Google is also targeting the more popular Rhythm music bot. While the owner of that service claims it&#39;s not shutting down, its days are clearly numbered.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/groovy-bot-discord-youtube-music-145236619.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0f924253-cbec-41bd-a997-43aed51096fa</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 14:52:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629903160</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T14:52:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/43be4240-f516-11eb-a7e3-a5fa5a79637e" width="2846" height="1792" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/43be4240-f516-11eb-a7e3-a5fa5a79637e" width="2846" height="1792" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sabrina Bracher via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Young man wearing headset and play computer video games online - Home isolated for coronavirus outbreak]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Young man wearing headset and play computer video games online - Home isolated for coronavirus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[President Biden is meeting with Apple, Google and Microsoft on cybersecurity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US has suffered a flurry of major cyberattacks targeting everyone from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-federal-prosecutors-160655082.html">federal prosecutors</a> through to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jbs-cyberattack-meat-factories-usa-canada-australia-171823530.html">meat suppliers</a>, and the White House hopes some discussions with key companies will produce some long-term security solutions. The <em>Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/25/white-house-cybersecurity-summit-apple-amazon/">reports</a> that President Biden, certain cabinet members and relevant security officials are <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/08/25/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-the-presidents-upcoming-cybersecurity-meeting/">holding</a> talks on August 25th with tech giants ADP, Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and Microsoft to see how they can help bolster cybersecurity.</p><p>While the spate of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/colonial-pipeline-restarts-operations-060635370.html">ransomware attacks</a> will be on the agenda, a senior Biden administration official said the White House wanted to tackle the &quot;root causes&quot; of cybersecurity issues. This included addressing a wide range of vulnerabilities, instituting &quot;good operational practices&quot; and hiring more security workers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The conversations will also involve financial and insurance giants (including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Travelers) as well as educational organizations like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-28-code-org-frozen-starwars-courses.html">Code.org</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-10-gm-and-girls-who-code-partner-for-after-school-stem-program.html">Girls Who Code</a>. While the Biden meeting is at the center of the discussions, the chats with cabinet members and officials are billed as &quot;informal&quot; sessions that will help establish definitive solutions.</p><p>The White House said the meetups were a recognition that the US needed a &quot;whole-of-nation&quot; cybersecurity strategy involving both the government and private sector. It also promised this wouldn&#39;t be the &quot;last engagement&quot; with companies on security issues. This comes soon after Biden took multiple steps in a bid to improve digital security for vital infrastructure, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/white-house-eo-network-security-010757835.html">issuing an executive order</a> meant to bolster federal security standards and coordination.</p><p>The question, as always, is whether or not the discussions will lead to meaningful action. The meeting with tech firms might help with top-down decision-making, but that won&#39;t matter much unless the other talks also lead to tangible strategy changes. This could be little more than a public relations exercise if the companies don&#39;t (or can&#39;t) commit to specific cybersecurity improvements.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/presdient-biden-cybersecurity-talks-apple-google-microsoft-143505316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02250465-129f-4e0c-ac42-6c6f8fd3c283</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 14:35:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629902107</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T14:35:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7cca0260-057c-11ec-9e2f-6353e32b766f" width="8359" height="5573" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7cca0260-057c-11ec-9e2f-6353e32b766f" width="8359" height="5573" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drew Angerer via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 24: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks about the situation in Afghanistan in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on August 24, 2021 in Washington, DC.

Users will also be able to send cash to friends as a “birthday gift” with Facebook Pay, which is essentially like any other person-to-person payment in Messenger but adds some new celebratory animations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The app is also adding a new type of mini game to chats with “poll games.” The feature allows friends in group threads to weigh in on lighthearted polls that ask which member of the chat is “most likely” to do something like miss a flight or fight zombies. Both the new birthday effects, poll games, and birthday gifting are rolling out now. Messenger also previewed a new “word effects” feature coming “in the near future” that allows users to pair an emoji with a specific word or phrase in order to trigger an in-chat animation similar to iMessage’s special effects.</p><p>The updates underscore just how much Messenger has changed in its first decade of existence. Originally launched in 2011, the app evolved from a basic chat app to one so bloated with features it’s been redesigned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-facebook-rebuilt-messenger-for-cross-app-chat.html"><ins>at least</ins></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-app-redesign-140445037.html"><ins>three</ins></a> times in the last two years. It’s been home to many of Facebook’s more ambitious — though not always <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-08-facebook-m-ai-assistant-closure.html"><ins>successful</ins></a> — features over the years.</p><p>More recently, Facebook has been weaving Messenger more tightly into its other services by pushing users to link their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-chat-across-instagram-and-messenger-120049504.html"><ins>Instagram DMs</ins></a> with their Messenger account. Facebook wants to bring this same kind of “cross-app communication” <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/18/facebook-testing-interoperability-whatsapp/"><ins>to WhatsApp</ins></a> as well, though the company hasn’t said much about how or when it could happen. Likewise, it’s still not clear when Messenger will turn on end-to-end encryption as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-default/"><ins>default setting</ins></a>.</p><p>During a call with reporters, Facebook’s Messenger chief Stan Chudnovsky said that the rollout of encryption as a default is moving slowly in part due to the sheer number of features in the messaging app. “We need to rebuild all these features in [an] end-to-end encrypted environment, and make them fully capable,” he said, noting that Messenger is still continuously adding new features. “It&#39;s almost like we are constantly trying to catch up with ourselves.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-10th-anniversary-features-133027577.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">823d19eb-b460-42be-881e-2e9d6537771f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:30:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629855221</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T01:33:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1544f070-0543-11ec-819b-39561b4f9fb1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1544f070-0543-11ec-819b-39561b4f9fb1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Messenger is 10.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[facebook messenger 10 years]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[OnlyFans has 'suspended' its ban on sexually explicit content]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OnlyFans&#39; upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-sexually-explicit-content-ban-184819350.html">ban on sexually explicit material</a> appears to be over before it even began.

There’s no doubt the popularity of Apple’s AirPods helped make these headphones a mainstay, but companies’ ability to offer reliable connectivity, great sound and active noise cancellation (ANC) in an increasingly smaller form factor has hastened widespread adoption. You can also get features that used to be reserved for premium models on mid-range devices. Of course, the popularity means that new earbuds are popping up all the time and the list of options is longer than ever. To help, we’ve compiled the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, including noteworthy features for each selection.</p><h2>Best overall: Sony WF-1000XM4</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/e946df82-c85a-11eb-be66-b32ed77c6949" alt="Sony totally overhauled its true wireless earbuds with a new design, more powerful noise cancellation, improved battery life and more. However, the choice to change to foam tips leads to an awkward fit that could be an issue for some people.

The former promises 1,111 horsepower, which rivals the Tesla Model S Plaid, and can hit 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds.</p><p>The Dream Edition Range, meanwhile, will deliver 933 horsepower and take 0.2 seconds longer to go from 0-60 mph. Both have a top speed of 168 mph, cost $169,000 (before factoring in federal tax credits or other incentives) and are expected to ship later this year. You&#39;ll be able to identify each variant with the &quot;P&quot; or &quot;R&quot; letter on their respective badges.

This new edition of the device is packing both ECG and EDA sensors, both of which were first found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-review-eda-stress-blood-oxygen-specs-price-130048259.html">higher-end Sense</a>, to better help you monitor your heart health and stress. Charge 5 also gets a few quality-of-life improvements <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-4-review-120052713.html">compared to its predecessor</a>, including a new body that’s 10 percent thinner and a new color AMOLED display with an always-on option.</p><p>But the real point of this new tech is to integrate the Fitbit into your daily health routines as something more than just a tracker. The ECG sensor will, naturally, help you check your heart’s electrical activity and check for signs of atrial fibrillation. The EDA, or Electrodermal Activity sensor (itself a fancier term for Galvanic Skin Response) is designed to measure the perspiration of your hands, which can be a marker for stress. As with the Sense, users can then be coached through a stress-reduction session if their stats get too aggressive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fa9df64fb38647148bf043b8e114523a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozWbsAayGEE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Fitbit is also looking to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-deepak-chopra-mindful-method-available-now-140036885.html">bolster</a> its $10-per-month <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-28-fitbit-premium.html">Premium offering</a> to encourage more of its hardware users to sign up to a monthly subscription. That includes a new Daily Readiness Score, which sounds a lot like Garmin’s Body Battery calculation, which will examine how ready you are to work out. It’ll do that by looking at your heart rate variability, recent sleep schedule and activity to judge if you should hit the treadmill or the couch that day.</p><p>Premium will also get a new collection of workouts from Les Mills to help coach you through the workout du jour. In addition, Fitbit is partnering with Calm, and Premium users will get access to “30 pieces of Calm content in seven languages,” with users able to run an EDA scan at the same time as listening to a Calm-created mindfulness session. Or they will be, since the material is expected to arrive at some point in September.</p><p>The <a href="https://bit.ly/3B5T0Yc">Fitbit Charge 5</a> is available to pre-order today, and will cost $179.95 complete with six months of Fitbit Premium thrown in.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-eda-sensors-heart-stress-i-h-130058156.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff0f76d5-7a74-408d-b887-9841ab0df203</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:00:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629896062</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T12:54:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a621b330-05a2-11ec-b73b-46d210701afd" width="1050" height="700" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a621b330-05a2-11ec-b73b-46d210701afd" width="1050" height="700" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fitbit]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the new Fitbit Charge 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fitbit Charge 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zoom's latest update includes gesture-activated reactions on iPad]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-delays-hq-office-return-until-2022-amid-covid-19-surge-055819058.html">businesses</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-delays-office-reopening-plans-211711342.html">delay</a> the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-return-to-office-092520216.html"> return</a> to the office, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Zoom">Zoom</a> looks set to keep thriving in a hybrid work setup.

The others are &quot;slow down,&quot; &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no,&quot; while the standard emoji also include clapping hands, heart, tears of joy, open mouth and party popper (celebration). The gist of non-verbal feedback is to allow participants to communicate with the host while maintaining the flow of a meeting. Using physical gestures may help novice Zoomers to express themselves without the fear of mishaps.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5160a00-0591-11ec-bf77-4b7a378f8eff" style="height:4365;width:5310;" alt="Zoom" data-uuid="934bb30f-855c-37aa-8c74-57a4e28b30f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zoom</div></figure><p>As mentioned, this latest update is a biggie, but how much of it you notice depends on the parts of Zoom you actually use. For Meetings, there&#39;s a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zooms-new-focus-mode-is-designed-to-block-student-distractions-082533097.html">Focus Mode</a> that only shows participants the host and the content they are sharing. As its name implies, the feature is designed to cut out distractions. You can now also seamlessly transition a meeting from mobile to desktop and vice versa. Plus, admins can limit screen sharing when a guest joins a meeting.</p><p>In addition, Zoom is making the chat sidebar easier to navigate with public and private channel markers. Now, the display will generally show fewer chats and channels per group, but you&#39;ll be able to expand it to see more activity. Zoom is also once again moving the search function to the left side. Lastly, you can try out the new admin experience — which puts a bunch of management controls in one place — before it becomes the default in October.</p><p>As for calls, Zoom Phone users are getting more usage metrics, group call monitoring privileges and a privacy feature that prevents others from accessing shared line calls.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zooms-update-gesture-reactions-130053956.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fd926609-65d7-4103-89ee-6d644044fe60</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:00:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629888850</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T10:56:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/798e04b0-0591-11ec-9e9b-8b3f295fc1fc" width="1819" height="1360" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/798e04b0-0591-11ec-9e9b-8b3f295fc1fc" width="1819" height="1360" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Otter's transcription tech now supports Microsoft Teams, Google Meet and Webex]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Otter has a solution for that pile-up of virtual meetings in your calendar.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html">Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic</a> are the first devices running the new “Wear OS powered by Samsung.”</p><p>But software isn&#39;t their only intriguing new feature. Samsung also upgraded the biometric sensors to offer, among other things, a body composition scanner and improved sleep tracking. Throw in new 5nm processors and sharper screens and the Watch 4 series looks like a meaty update. Has the Apple Watch finally met its match? Probably not, but one can hope.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before we get too far ahead, it’s worth noting that other than the Classic having a physical spinning bezel and a stainless steel case, there aren’t major differences between <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:the two Watch 4 models" href="https://fave.co/2WoM3D1">the two Watch 4 models</a>. They have the same upgraded sensors, battery and screen sizes, so most of what I’m going to cover in this review applies to both models, unless I specify otherwise.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f1021c00-0507-11ec-bfbf-24732406063d" alt="Side view of a black Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 on a person who has their arms folded across their chest." data-uuid="f0eb1ae6-49b5-3377-80b1-b8daf2747b3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><h2><br>Wear OS and One UI</h2><p>Let’s start with the most intriguing change in both watches: Wear OS. Honestly, if I didn&#39;t know the Watch 4 was using a whole new OS, I might have just assumed this was a minor Tizen update. You’ll still swipe sideways or spin the physical bezel on the Classic to scroll through all your widgets and use the touch-sensitive ring around the regular Watch 4’s screen. But instead of All Apps being one of the pages on the right, they’re now below the home screen. There’s also a customizable quick settings panel above the main page, too.</p><p>Of course, the dead giveaway that there’s something more going on here is that you can now download apps from the Play Store directly from your wrist. A section in the Play Store shows all the apps on your phone that have Wear counterparts and I easily added Telegram and Spotify from this page. This seamless installation of apps that are already on your phone onto your watch is one of the features that Samsung said its One UI software would enable. I was expecting them to automatically show up on the watch without me doing any work, but I guess this way you get to decide what you want on your wrist.</p><p>One UI also allows for settings on your watch and phone to sync, so that when you enable Do Not Disturb on one, the other activates it too. When you play a song on your phone, a media controller is supposed to appear on the wearable. These only work with Samsung’s phones, though, so if you’re using some other Android device this doesn’t apply. Oh and while we’re at it, the Watch 4 series doesn’t work with iOS, unlike its predecessors. But if you’re an iPhone owner you probably weren’t considering an Android watch to begin with.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2dc27a40-0508-11ec-9fde-82cf6f7e1f51" alt="Close up of a black Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic with two fingers on the physical rotating bezel." data-uuid="67afee14-ab31-34ee-9987-73cc922ae005"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>One last thing that Samsung added via One UI: gesture controls. In theory, this will let you answer or dismiss calls by flicking your wrist or lifting your arm. I enabled the setting and was able to answer a call by raising my wrist as instructed, but dismissing them by rotating my fist did not work. This could potentially make it easier to use the watch with one-hand or when I have my arms full, but they don’t work very well at the moment and are limited to responding to calls or messages.</p><h2>New sensor and new features</h2><p>In addition to brand new (yet familiar) software, the Watch 4 line also got a serious hardware upgrade. Samsung used a new 3-in-1 biometric sensor that not only should allow for faster and more consistent readings, it also enables bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) to offer body mass scans.</p><p>The Watch will first ask for basic information like your gender, age and weight. Then, it tells you to place your middle and ring fingers on the two buttons on the edge. It’ll also instruct you to stay still and lift your arms away from your body while it scans, which takes about 15 seconds. Once it’s done, the system spits out a comprehensive breakdown of your body, saying how many pounds of water, fat and skeletal mass it detected.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/88969550-0508-11ec-bfdf-aa04ca7cdb7b" alt="Taking a body composition reading on the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 " data-uuid="0dd1ca2d-70ff-352e-9b20-50d431f2b93c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>I’ve been excited about this new feature, since body composition is generally a better way to understand your overall health than BMI. I’d been using Amazon’s camera-based system in its Halo app to determine my body fat percentage and though that’s been a handy and seemingly accurate method, BIA is a more conventional and common means.</p><p>The problem I realized after a few days is that a watch might not be the best place to have BIA sensors. Since the scan requires you to be fairly still and not touch other parts of your body, it can be quite awkward to do. That would be fine if the only issue were standing in an uncomfortable stance for 15 seconds every now and then, but small changes in your posture can affect your result.</p><p>I took two scans just seconds apart, one with my arms lifted further away from my body than the other. The first time, I got a 26 percent fat scan result, and the next I got 30 percent. I wasn’t expecting complete accuracy, and I know consistency can be affected by time of day and how you’re standing, but so far the results are unreliable.</p><p>I’ll need a few more weeks or months to test the BIA system, measuring at the same time of day, to see if it produces helpful overall trend data. After all, changes in your body composition can take time to register.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cb865b20-0508-11ec-adf7-1dabc05af16c" alt="Body composition measurement results on the screen of a black Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 " data-uuid="3610ac09-bf1a-3a92-af90-f5a79a93b718"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Something else that requires more time for me to get a sense of its usefulness is continuous blood oxygen detection. That’s one of the new sleep-tracking features the upgraded sensors enables, and that data feeds into Samsung’s Sleep Score algorithm, which considers other things like duration and restfulness. In older Galaxy Watches, you can get your blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) readings at-will, but the Watch 4 is able to do a constant measurement overnight. When I woke up, the Watch 4 told me my SpO2 was between 93 and 97 percent, which is slightly lower than I’d like, but could explain why I’ve been so fatigued.</p><p>Blood oxygen is one of five factors that go into Samsung’s sleep score, which the company said considers a variety of metrics. Another new thing the Watch 4 can detect this year is snoring. If you want to enable snore detection, you’ll not only have to wear the watch to bed, but also place your phone “on a stable surface near your head” within two feet of your person, and have the bottom of the phone pointing at you. You can choose to have snoring detection on always or only for one night, and you can also opt to record audio to hear your sleep noises the next day. Samsung also gives you the option to delete the recordings after a day, 31 days or 100 days. I don&#39;t snore but the potential medical benefits here could be useful for those who do.</p><p>The one thing I’d like Samsung to fix is very minor: I couldn’t find the setting to enable snore detection in the Health app until after I had recorded a night of sleep. This was pretty easy to do — I just manually added an entry.</p><p>The rest of the updates that the new sensor brings about are less noticeable, like faster heart rate monitoring and updated calorie count algorithms that take into account continuous and discrete pulse readings. These are mostly under the hood, which makes knowing whether there’s a meaningful difference hard to tell until I’ve spent a lot more time with the devices.</p><section data-eng-breakout="4789bbecd51b4ddc8703d88493e007c7" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f4f64420-0508-11ec-b731-7bea7e190179" alt="A black Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic nestled in some foliage on a planter."></section><h2>Design and display</h2><p>Another area where the Watch 4 series got a small upgrade that’s not very obvious is its screen. The larger versions of the devices now have sharper 1.4-inch screens running at 450 x 450, while the smaller models have 1.2-inch panels. They otherwise aren’t much different in size from their predecessors.</p><p>I’m used to the Apple Watch SE, and though the Galaxy Watch 4 is actually about 5 grams lighter and its case is only a hair wider, it still felt a little large on my wrist. Its case alone is an acceptable size and weight, but the 20mm strap that Samsung includes is a little stiff out of the box and feels uncomfortable. Over time, though, this should get more pliable and less cuff-like, and you can also swap it out for something softer.</p><p>Because it has a physical rotating bezel and a stainless steel case, the Watch 4 Classic is heavier and chunkier than the Watch 4, which has a touch-sensitive ring. While I liked using the mechanical wheel to interact with <del>Tizen</del> Wear OS, it made the device bulky enough that I didn’t want to wear it when working out or going to sleep.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4bc24470-0509-11ec-94e9-ed0b3ea276d8" alt="A black Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 on a wrist" data-uuid="47d2f371-35e6-3204-b478-6e60b6707f9b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><h2>Performance, in use and battery life</h2><p>Though they look similar to their predecessors, the Watch 4 series boast a significant update inside. They’re powered by new 5nm processors with significantly more storage than before. That additional space should allow you to load more songs on the device, while the processor should make the system fly. And for the most part, the Watch 4s ran smoothly and quickly. The only times I had to sit around waiting for something to happen were when I loaded the Play Store or accidentally triggered Bixby. Speaking of Samsung’s assistant — it’s set to launch when you long-press the top button by default, but you can set it to bring up the power menu instead.</p><p>Something I’ve always loved about Galaxy watches is how accurately and quickly they register when I’ve been walking briskly. This year, Samsung updated the software to auto detect a workout after 10 minutes instead of 15. It was gratifying to have a session automatically recorded after I had spent exactly 10 minutes run-walking from a Long Island Railroad platform in Penn station to the Path an avenue away.</p><p>The watches are also capable of tracking 95 different workout types, which is nice if you like to get specific with what you’re doing at the gym. I found the running coach mode a little too aggressive with its suggestions, and there are little differences between Samsung and Apple’s systems that would take too much time to spell out, like which brand undercounts distance traveled on a treadmill and which one is too eager to tell me it thinks I’ve stopped walking, for example. But overall the Galaxy Watch 4 are capable activity trackers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c076d2e0-0509-11ec-9ffe-f12b26f5f23f" alt="A Thom Browne edition of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 laying on its side with greenery in the background." data-uuid="4e487ec3-aa42-3ef8-b862-4c53d70a46bd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, it seems like all the upgrades Samsung added hurt the battery life. Most smartwatches last between one to two days, but for some reason the Galaxy Watch 4 series barely lasts a day. I removed my Watch 4 from the charger at 3pm one afternoon, enabled Always On Display two hours later, and the device died the next day at 5pm.</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><p>Short battery life is my biggest issue with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic" href="https://fave.co/2WoM3D1">Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic</a>, which are otherwise capable, useful smartwatches. Though some of the newer features like body composition measurement and snore detection might not seem immediately useful, they could provide helpful insight over time. The new Wear OS powered by Samsung isn’t a huge departure from Tizen, which means we’re still getting a powerful, intuitive interface with comprehensive health-tracking features.</p><p>Throw in a bigger ecosystem of third-party apps and the Watch 4 series has the potential to offer even more functions. I wish Samsung could make them smaller, thinner and lighter and also extend their runtimes. But — and I know the bar is pretty low here — the Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic are still the best smartwatches for Android users.</p><h2>Key specs</h2><p></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><p><strong>Sizes</strong>: 40mm / 44mm; 42mm / 46mm (Classic)</p><p><strong>Display</strong>: 1.2-inch 396 x 396 (smaller models); 1.4-inch 450 x 450 (larger models)</p><p><strong>Processor</strong>: Dual-core 1.18GHz Exynos W920 Dual Core</p><p><strong>RAM / Storage</strong>: 1.5GB with 16GB storage</p><p><strong>Battery size</strong>: 247mAh(smaller models) ; 361mAh (larger models)</p><p><strong>OS</strong>: Wear OS powered by Samsung with One UI Watch 3</p><p><strong>Durability and water resistance</strong>: 5 ATM, IP68 and MIL-STD-810G</p><p><strong>Connectivity</strong>: LTE, Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n (2.4+5GHz), NFC and GPS/Glonass/Beidou/Galileo</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 25.9 / 30.3 grams; 46.5 / 52 grams (Classic)</p><p><strong>Sensors</strong>: Samsung BioActive Sensor (Optical Heart Rate + Electrical Heart + Bioelectrical  Impedance Analysis), Accelerometer, Barometer, Gyro Sensor, Geomagnetic  Sensor, Light Sensor</p></div><p>Photos by David Imel (<a href="https://twitter.com/DurvidImel">@DurvidImel</a>)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7dac388d-97c3-4f20-ace9-519ef7c46af9</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 12:00:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629895220</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T12:44:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b81f6d20-0507-11ec-bbfa-56e6c0bd5ed6" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b81f6d20-0507-11ec-bbfa-56e6c0bd5ed6" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A black Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 on a wrist]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Xbox Cloud Gaming will bring game streaming to its consoles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Were you ready to be <em>underwhelmed</em>?

According to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-unlock-bootloader-broken-camera/"><em>XDA-Developers</em></a>, the foldable device shows a warning when you attempt to unlock its bootloader, telling you that doing so &quot;will cause the camera to be disabled and may cause your phones and apps to stop working correctly.&quot; Indeed, that&#39;s exactly what happens when you do go through with the process to gain root access and modify the device&#39;s software.</p><p>After unlocking the bootloader, you&#39;ll notice that the stock camera app will fail to operate. You&#39;ll no longer be able to fire it up to take photos, and the apps on your phone that use the camera won&#39;t be able to access it, as well. Those apps — yes, including third-party camera apps — just remain dark or time out after a while, so there&#39;s no workaround.

As the publication notes, Samsung has always made it difficult to root its phones: Modifying the device&#39;s software already voids your warranty and kills Samsung Pay. This is next level protection, though — and perhaps a most effective one — considering most people at this point in time frequently use their phones as cameras. <em>XDA</em> says re-locking the bootloader will also re-enable the Galaxy Fold 3&#39;s camera, so all won&#39;t be lost if you do decide to try it out and poke around for a solution yourself.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-disables-galaxy-z-fold-3-camera-unlock-bootloader-044518459.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6467bb73-c545-4914-b0b4-6b479a089e12</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 04:45:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629866731</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T04:45:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5d1bd9d0-0558-11ec-babf-42ae6a6c05ce" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5d1bd9d0-0558-11ec-babf-42ae6a6c05ce" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[California expands Activision Blizzard lawsuit to include temporary workers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) has expanded the scope of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html">sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit</a> against Activision Blizzard to include temporary workers.

According to the agency, only 20 percent of all employees at the studio are women, and they’re consistently paid less, overlooked for promotions and fired faster than their male counterparts.

So, to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, my favorite console of all time, which arrived in the US on August 23rd, 1991, I wish you many happy returns.</p><p>The SNES wasn’t my first console. Like many kids of the ‘80s, I started with the venerable NES. But that system never quite felt like mine. I played it at friends’ houses for years before my parents relented and got me one for Christmas in 1989. While I don’t want to downplay my excitement, I had already played many of the platform’s classic games. So while it was a huge deal to have my own NES, I wasn’t exactly coming to it fresh.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But the Super NES, that console was <em>mine</em>. I didn’t get it on launch day, but I had been eagerly devouring details about it in <em>Nintendo Power</em>.&nbsp;I started saving my allowance, doing extra chores and monitoring weekly sales flyers for price drops. Finally, at some point in 1992, I brought it home – the console, two outstanding controllers whose design has stood the test of time and <em>Super Mario World</em>. (Remember how generous game companies used to be with the pack-ins?)</p><div id="c4c44020b2834fed9f1122573bc6cb75"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">On this day 30 years ago, the Super Nintendo Entertainment System launched in North America! What are some of your favorite <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SNES?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SNES</a> games and memories? <a href="https://t.co/NjpZqPi9U9">pic.twitter.com/NjpZqPi9U9</a></p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1429820774907584512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 23, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Obviously, one does not buy a console to ogle the hardware. It’s all about the games, and <em>Super Mario World</em> was an outstanding introduction to the system. I was plenty familiar with Mario at this point, but the sheer scope this time around was stunning. Individual levels were massive and crammed with secrets, and you could re-enter and play them again for the first time to find everything. New additions like Yoshi and the cape power-up offered new ways to navigate and explore these levels.</p><p>And, of course, the game both looked and sounded fantastic. <em>Super Mario Bros. 3</em> pushed the NES about as far as it could go, but <em>Super Mario World</em> underscored how much more capable the new system was. Mario and some familiar enemies looked more vibrant and detailed than ever, and the system’s power was also evident in those sprawling levels and environments. It was the first Mario game with a save feature, and with good reason. There was no way to take in even half of what the game offered in just one sitting.</p><div id="2b962af97e7042a3b1e407a8dc280359"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWyMk-2aH9E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>This underlines how video game development was changing with 16-bit consoles. Many NES games were ports of arcade mainstays, perhaps modified to make them more suitable for extended play sessions. But they were still games meant to be finished in one session, once you got good enough. RPGs like <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Warrior</em>, not to mention Nintendo’s own adventure game <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> bucked that trend with a bigger focus on exploration and a save feature so you could proceed at your own pace. But with the Super NES, developers were thinking bigger, regardless of genre.</p><p>For me, the finest example of this is <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</em>. It was the second game I bought for the system, despite having never played the earlier NES Zelda games — the buzz around it was just too enticing. It was a smart choice, because it’s still on the short list of my favorite games ever. Its art style remains gorgeous 30 years later, the soundtrack is fantastic, and the freedom of exploration, combined with all the puzzles to unravel, was unlike anything I had played before.&nbsp;</p><div id="8cf31d34044e4a3cb7981b7bbc4d7273"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qbIet2sM-JA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The story’s twists and turns made me always want to keep pushing forward, but I also was happy to go off the path and search for secrets I hadn’t found. And there are still a handful of show-stopping moments that rank among the most memorable game experiences I’ve had. Striding out of the Sanctuary after the first hour or so of gameplay with the booming main theme behind me, getting the Master Sword and the final showdown with Ganon after months of play leading up to it are just a few&nbsp; parts of the game that I’ll never forget.</p><p>Besides these bigger titles, the SNES still had plenty of arcade ports – they were just much better than in the NES era. The SNES was far more capable of replicating the arcade experience, and games like <em>Street Fighter II</em>, <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time</em> were outstanding ways for me to get my arcade fix.</p><p>Broadly speaking, the SNES enjoyed strong third-party developer support from companies like Capcom, Konami, Tecmo, Square and Enix. And while I spent tons of hours on those aforementioned arcade games and other excellent titles like Capcom’s <em>Mega Man X</em>, the SNES allowed Nintendo to flex its muscles as one of the best game developers around.</p><p>The list of all-time classics that Nintendo published during the system’s lifespan is impressive. Aside from <em>Super Mario World</em>, games like <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Donkey Kong Country</em> (and its sequels), <em>Super Metroid, Yoshi’s Island, EarthBound</em> and <em>Super Mario Kart</em> were critically acclaimed, hugely popular or both. Launch titles <em>F-Zero</em> and <em>Pilotwings</em> didn&#39;t hit those heights, but they still provided the SNES with a strong and varied lineup from day one.</p><p>All these games and many more have kept me coming back to the SNES over the many years since it launched. I played it throughout high school and when I came home from college; at some point I lost track of that console and all the games I had, though. It was a tough pill to swallow, but since I (like many Nintendo fans) have re-bought favorite games on the systems like the Wii and the Switch, not to mention the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-27-snes-classic-edition-review.html">tiny SNES Classic Edition</a>. Of course, you can’t be the real thing, so I picked up a used SNES about 10 years ago, too. I don’t play it often, but I’m happier knowing I can when I want to.</p><p>It’s not just for nostalgia, either. Somehow, I have never played <em>Super Metroid</em> – and with <em>Metroid Dread</em> coming out soon, I think it’s high time I finally try another of the system’s all-time greats. I never would have expected that I’d be playing the Super NES 30 years after it arrived in the US, but I won’t be surprised if I still go back to these games 30 years from now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/super-nintendo-entertainment-system-30th-anniversary-193016005.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9090326c-1d9e-4f9b-b10b-6a5997326686</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 19:30:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629833419</ingested><modified>2021-08-24T19:30:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2f39beb0-050d-11ec-8b7f-d76bee7057ed" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2f39beb0-050d-11ec-8b7f-d76bee7057ed" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pint-sized 'Pac-Man' and 'PAW Patrol' arcade machines for kids are on the way]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;re never really too young to start gaming, but some kids might struggle to get to grips with standard arcade machines.
