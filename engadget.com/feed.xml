Microsoft told <em>The Verge</em> in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date">statement</a> that it expected to upgrade the first Duo to Android 11 &quot;before the end of this year.&quot; The company didn&#39;t say what to expect with the update, although it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-hands-on-price-specs-buggy-update-triple-camera-160008199.html">Surface Duo 2</a> features carried over to the older dual-screen phone.</p><p>Android 11 on the Duo 2 refines the multitasking experience, such as prioritizing the right-hand screen.

Microsoft is delivering Android 11 right as Google is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-5-final-170051810.html">close to releasing Android 12</a>. Surface Duo owners will still be roughly a year behind their counterparts with conventional phones. That&#39;s understandable given the challenges of supporting a dual-screen device, but it won&#39;t be much consolation to Duo users wanting to try the latest Android features.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-203521352.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e314a981-3da0-43c8-b4db-0eddf1aeea80</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 20:35:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632428735</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T20:25:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e12a6190-1ca7-11ec-a3df-bf1fb1b78b36" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e12a6190-1ca7-11ec-a3df-bf1fb1b78b36" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Duo]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Duo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clubhouse's Wave feature makes it easier for users to create private rooms]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, that didn’t take long.

Per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58668534"><em><ins>BBC</ins></em></a>, the UK Court of Appeal recently <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2021/1374.html"><ins>ruled</ins></a> against Dr. Stephen Thaler in a case involving the country’s Intellectual Property Office. In 2018, Thaler filed two patent applications in which he didn’t list himself as the creator of the inventions mentioned in the documents. Instead, he put down his AI DABUS and said the patent should go to him “by ownership of the creativity machine.”</p><p>The Intellectual Property Office told Thaler he had to list a real person on the application. When he didn’t do that, the agency decided he had withdrawn from the process. Thaler took the case to the UK’s High Court. The body ruled against him, leading to the eventual appeal. &quot;Only a person can have rights. A machine cannot,&quot; Lady Justice Elisabeth Laing of the Appeal Court wrote in her judgment. &quot;A patent is a statutory right and it can only be granted to a person.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thaler has filed similar legal challenges in other countries, and the results so far have been mixed. In August, a <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/australian-judge-rules-inventions-6431529/"><ins>judge in Australia ruled</ins></a> inventions created by an AI can qualify for a patent. However, only earlier this month, US District Judge Leonie M Brinkema upheld a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-patent-office-artificial-intelligence-inventor-patent-221309654.html"><ins>decision by the US Patent and Trademark Office</ins></a> that said “only natural persons may be named as an inventor in a patent application.&quot; Judge Brinkema said there may eventually be a time when AI becomes sophisticated enough to satisfy the accepted definitions of inventorship, but noted, “that time has not yet arrived, and, if it does, it will be up to Congress to decide how, if at all, it wants to expand the scope of patent law.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-appeal-court-artificial-intelligence-patent-191631993.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a0f61a8-22ff-4e0f-beb9-2aac42652b8c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:16:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632424661</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T19:17:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44507a40-1ca1-11ec-af7e-f61faa6bcdca" width="4950" height="3300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44507a40-1ca1-11ec-af7e-f61faa6bcdca" width="4950" height="3300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[oonal via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Patent pending files folder]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Patent pending files folder]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge update adds tab groups and new shopping features]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just ahead of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-release-date-132605467.html"><ins>Windows 11 launch</ins></a>, Microsoft is <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/09/23/our-top-new-features-are-designed-to-put-your-family-first/"><ins>rolling out</ins></a> some updates to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/edge"><ins>Edge</ins></a>.

When you&#39;re on a product page, click the blue tag on the address bar and you&#39;ll see expert reviews from reliable sources, as well as the average consumer star rating from various retailers.</p><p>When you do figure out what to buy, Microsoft aims to help you complete the transaction a bit faster. If you select a retailer&#39;s guest checkout option, you can click &quot;Try express checkout&quot; on the address bar. After you fill in your details manually one time, Edge can save them for future transactions on any shopping site. Once you&#39;re sure everything&#39;s accurate, click the &quot;Try all coupons and autofill details.&quot; Edge will then add your information and automatically find out if there are any coupons that can save you some cash, in a similar way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-paypal-buys-money-saving-service-honey.html"><ins>PayPal&#39;s Honey tool</ins></a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, Edge now has built-in travel recommendations. When you look up flights, you can click a notification on the address bar and you&#39;ll see suggestions of things to visit and do at your planned destination. The tool is only available in the US and on select booking sites for now, but it will be available elsewhere soon.</p><p>On top of that, it should be a bit faster for you to look for flights and hotels across multiple websites. Once you enter details on a booking site, Edge can store that info. It can then autofill the travel dates and so on when you visit another site. The company says it has improved flight search results in Bing too with the help of travel industry partners.</p><p>Elsewhere, the new personalized news feed called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-start-personalized-news-feed-164505328.html"><ins>Microsoft Start</ins></a> is integrated into the browser. You&#39;ll see headlines and articles relevant to your interests from a range of publishers when you open a new tab.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-tab-groups-shopping-features-travel-news-185421812.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52fd96d1-c4d1-4d7c-8e04-40e5add5afa9</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 18:54:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632423266</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T18:54:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/26a74670-1c9e-11ec-ab3f-01e751891c2b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/26a74670-1c9e-11ec-ab3f-01e751891c2b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot of the Microsoft Edge browser that reads "You have saved $40 with Microsoft Edge."  new feature allows users to automatically check if any coupons are applicable while shopping.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge coupon feature]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter will make it easier to discover and listen to audio Spaces]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter will soon make Spaces even more prominent in its app as it looks to add more creator-focused tools to the live audio feature.

To that point, Airbnb said it&#39;s assessing the possibility of expanding the availability of the program to other countries that have committed to resettling Afghan refugees.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-afghan-refugee-commitment-update-162825619.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6bfb7e01-a176-4d98-a3ba-6c2e75f024ce</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 16:28:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632414509</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T16:28:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2aaba7c0-1c8a-11ec-afdc-f409694f954f" width="3000" height="1963" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2aaba7c0-1c8a-11ec-afdc-f409694f954f" width="3000" height="1963" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yannis Behrakis / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Afghan immigrants land at a beach on the Greek island of Kos after crossing a portion of the south-eastern Aegean Sea between Turkey and Greece on a dinghy early May 27, 2015.

In the six years since, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-google-maps-ui-right-hand-drive-cars-181544539.html">both Android Auto</a> and the infotainment systems they operate on have gotten a whole lot smarter. On Thursday, Google announced that it will be rolling out even more features and capabilities to drivers, whether they run Android Auto on their phones or directly through their cars.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Android Auto has been designed to minimize distractions to the driver when on the road, initially connecting the phone to the infotainment or stereo system has to date been a whole thing. You’d have to make sure the Bluetooth radio was live on your phone, then cajole the vehicle into recognizing and pairing with the device, then remember the myriad various oral commands to incite Android Auto into doing what you actually wanted it to. But no longer! Drivers will soon be able to effectively automate the tethering process just by saying “Hey Google, let’s drive.”&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, Google has redesigned the Auto UI to enable access to a bevy of content sources including Amazon Music, Audible, iHeartRadio, JioSaavn, Pandora, Podcast Addict, SoundCloud, and YouTube Music with one-tap accessibility as well as have the system read incoming text messages aloud and allow the driver to respond by voice. Expect to see these new features arrive over the next few weeks in English-speaking markets as well as Germany, Spain, Mexico, France and Italy.</p><p>And for international travelers using dual-SIM phones, Android Auto will allow you to establish separate Work and Personal profiles and have their relevant contact lists and calendar appointments display, depending on when and why they’re behind the wheel.</p><p>For vehicles with in-car displays, Android Auto (the mirroring version, not what you’d find on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html">Polestar 2</a> or the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvos-c-40-recharge-knocks-the-ass-off-its-xc-40-predecessor-and-we-love-them-for-it-163057786.html">XC40 Recharge</a>) will soon boast a few new features, such as games. Google is partnering with GameSnacks to offer drivers quick and fun diversions to play while the vehicle is parked. Finally, an end to doom-scrolling while sitting in public charging lots. Conversely, Google is making paying for gas less interactive. Just say “Hey Google, pay for gas” to have the vehicle’s infotainment system complete a contactless payment with Google Pay. You do have to select the fuel grade and, you know, actually pump the gas but, still. The feature will be available at Exxon and Mobil gas stations to start with support for Shell, Conoco, Phillips 66 and 76 stations coming soon.</p><p>As for the integrated Android Automotive OS (like what you’d find in select Ford, GM, and Volvo vehicles), get ready to see it in a whole bunch of new makes and models. Google announced on Thursday that its latest partner is Honda, which will begin producing vehicles with built-in AAOS come the 2022 model year, and will soon be available in both the Chevy Silverado and the Renault Mégane E-Tech.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-android-automotive-os-honda-2022-160039999.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e307d566-6fe3-449c-8158-5ed1e36547d7</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 16:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632400299</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T12:31:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/27b7e140-1bdc-11ec-9eb7-27cee51e8c76" width="3882" height="2833" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/27b7e140-1bdc-11ec-9eb7-27cee51e8c76" width="3882" height="2833" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kim Kyung Hoon / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honda Motor's logo is seen on Civic sedan car at its showroom in Tokyo, Japan October 4, 2017.

Google is rolling out a batch of Android feature upgrades that include perks previously reserved for its in-house devices. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-ai-update-2021-edit-memories-184654311.html">Google Photos&#39; Locked Folder</a> is coming to Android 6 and newer devices, for instance — you can create a passcode-protected space to keep certain photos and videos separate from the rest.</p><p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-update-smart-compose-recorder-share-underwater-camera-180046621.html">Gboard&#39;s Smart Compose</a> is coming to Android 11 and newer hardware. If you&#39;re writing a common phrase or just want to save time, you&#39;ll get suggestions to complete messages. And there&#39;s good news if you&#39;re prone to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-heads-up-rollout-143602291.html">walking into lamp posts</a> — the Heads Up anti-distracted-walking feature is available through Digital Wellbeing on all Android 9 or later devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other additions are new to all Android devices. Google Assistant now has a central Reminders hub. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-nearby-share-specs-availability-160054637.html">Nearby Share</a> now includes a much-needed privacy control that can limit visibility to no one, contacts only or everyone. Gboard, meanwhile, can automatically suggest pasting addresses, phone numbers, web links and even screenshots. Over 1,500 new Emoji Kitchen stickers are due in the fall. And if you have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-led-bravia-t-vs-with-cognitive-intelligence-start-at-1299-094036566.html">Android TV</a>, you&#39;ll find remote control features built into Android on your phone.</p><p>This strategy is a familiar one for Google. It tends to bring features to Pixels first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-10-google-assistant-compact-revamp-reaches-phones.html">before a wider release</a>, whether it&#39;s to help sell phones or just to ensure they work well before reaching other devices.

Starting this week, users will see a new addition to the Android Accessibility Suite that can turn a phone&#39;s front-facing camera into a switch. Aptly called <a href="https://www.android.com/google-features-on-android/fall-2021/#cameraswitches">Camera Switch</a>, the tool replaces keyboards, mice and touchscreen displays as a device&#39;s input method. With the feature, users will be able to navigate their phones with eye movements or with facial features, such as smiling or opening and closing their mouths. The tech giant started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-face-114800871.html">beta testing</a> it in August, but it&#39;s now giving the feature a wider rollout.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61306940-1c65-11ec-bf5f-986f09574abe" style="height:329;width:640;" alt="Android" data-uuid="5393304c-2369-3404-aff8-09ac8647224c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The tech giant has also launched a new application called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.vision.switches">Project Activate</a> specifically for those don’t speak or have neurological conditions. Its purpose is to make it easier for the users to communicate with other people. They can program the app to speak phrases like &quot;Please, wait!&quot; when they move their eyes a certain way or make a gesture with their face. The application can also be programmed to play audio, make phone calls or send texts, such as emergency messages seeking assistance.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Finally, Google has updated its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-08-google-lookout-app.html">Lookout app</a> with handwriting recognition.

Nearly 20 years later, streaming reigns supreme and services like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/P0ab6Y">Disney+</a> seem to be returning to the idea, but bigger and grander with shows like <em>Marvel’s What If…?</em> and <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Visions</em>, premiering this week, is probably the more ambitious of the two, enlisting talent from various Japanese anime studios to create short films about different aspects of the Star Wars universe. The list includes juggernauts like Trigger (<em>Kill la Kill</em>, <em>Promare</em>) Production I.G (<em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</em>, <em>Haikyu!!</em>) and Science SARU (<em>Devilman Crybaby</em>, <em>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</em>). Unlike <em>The Animatrix</em>, Lucasfilm was content to mostly hand over the reins to these studios, creating shorts that differ in tone, style and, most notably, continuity.</p><div id="8f7ba6f5a1b94859941915a23b26ee32"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jtAsl-0o3O0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Robot Jedi? Sith twins? Intergalactic rock band whose members include a Hutt and a former Jedi padawan? It’s an intriguing array of concepts, but as a long-time Star Wars fan I couldn’t tell you how they fit into the timeline. If they fit in, at all. <em>Visions</em> is more about taking some base concepts — the Force, the Jedi, the Sith — and playing around with them in each studio’s unique style. It reminds me the most of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Batman: Gotham Knight " href="https://amzn.to/3kvlSnn"><em>Batman: Gotham Knight </em></a>from 2008, a collection of shorts also by various anime studios, including Production I.G. The one thing that DC Entertainment has always had going for it is the variety of TV and movie adaptations it’s had going on independently of each other, where audiences just understood that these weren’t meant to be connected in any way.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/243f9510-1c79-11ec-9f4b-f269c5dbee91" alt="Force-user and droid" data-uuid="e3aa1448-ce59-3e5a-97b8-f74e67842ad0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lucasfilm</div></figure><p>However, even for DC things have been changing in that regard, especially after last year’s “Crisis on Infinite Earths” crossover. For years now, the TV “Berlanti-verse” has been flirting with continuity, not just in how <em>The Flash</em> was a spinoff of <em>Arrow</em> and <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> was a spinoff of both, but even having the Flash and Supergirl meet up even though they were on different networks and in different universes.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/74bbdbf0-1c76-11ec-bbbe-de5ef0b676d4" alt="Grant Gustin and Melissa Benoit" data-uuid="c9e11686-5ad1-3732-bcfa-1e3074284795"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DC</div></figure><p>“Crisis” upped the ante by merging these separate worlds in the end, while also confirming almost every other DC-based TV show as part of the bigger multiverse. It was great for fans who obsessively watch every comic book program they can, but less so for people who would rather keep their viewing limited and compartmentalized.</p><p>On the other side, Marvel didn’t have the same deep catalog as DC did, with its live-action MCU franchise only taking off 13 years ago. Marvel Studios was perfectly happy to wipe the slate clean of everything that had come before, from the 1989 <em>Punisher</em> film to 2007’s <em>Ghost Rider</em> with Nicolas Cage. Since then everything live-action has tied into the universe somehow, including Netflix shows like <em>Daredevil</em>, Hulu shows like <em>Runaways</em> and the Freeform show <em>Cloak &amp; Dagger</em>. This was great for someone committed to the franchise, but could be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-star-wars-marvel-universe-canon-continuity-120159180.html">daunting to casual viewers</a>.</p><div id="d9cfb822275e479f85eb6b218d3aef23"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qRpd4lj69ZY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>It also presented some creative constraints. Everything Marvel now had to fit in with the larger MCU somehow, so once a character appeared another movie or show couldn’t present its own take on the same person (alas, poor Inhumans). They couldn’t have world-shaking events outside of, say, the Avengers films — at least, not without making some kind of excuse why Captain America or Thor couldn’t just come charging in. Everything had to be carefully planned out as the universe expanded and connected internally.</p><p>That’s partly why the show <em>What If…?</em> exists. Sure, it’s based on a pre-existing comic series, but what both show and comic do is allow creators free rein with the characters and events of the Marvel Universe, experimenting to see what would happen if you change one or two things. Though this week’s is hardly a “slight” difference.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/01464b40-1c78-11ec-bdfd-80e3ce750f64" alt="Thor and some " data-uuid="f2626e86-4981-3e32-9ed6-f0b563486ebd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>The point of divergence here is that Odin doesn’t adopt Loki as his son, leaving Thor to become an arrogant, spoiled child who prefers to party rather than take his duties as the would-be king of Asgard seriously. How is he still worthy of Mjolnir? We have no idea and the episode isn’t interested in telling us. Instead we’re shown how Thor likes to take the Warriors Three on long benders across the galaxy, with his next destination being the “backwater” of Earth. And everyone’s invited — Drax, Rocket, Howard the Duck, the Grandmaster and even Loki and the other ice giants who somehow, are friends with Thor <em>anyway</em> in this reality. When you consider why and how these characters got involved in the “main” timeline in the first place, it really doesn’t add up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63b592e0-1c78-11ec-9f0f-73f461f9c3e1" alt="Captain Marvel, Frigga and Thor" data-uuid="3915a3bb-f277-37f9-b8c4-376ae8db8f6b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>You could just try to enjoy it at face value, as just a silly story  with no larger bearing on continuity. However, the point has been made repeatedly that this show is technically, in continuity, and not just in the sense that the Marvel Universe consists of many realities and everything is valid somewhere. While other comics and shows can be given an official universe “number” like 616 or 1,999,999 and just written off as a huge divergence from what we know, the concept of <em>What If…?</em> is that it shows us incremental changes from the MCU in particular. But the divergences shown in this week’s episode are far more than incremental, with an offbeat, cartoonish tone to match. It’s the least <em>What If</em>-like <em>What If…?</em> installment so far.</p><p>Unfortunately, like most of the episodes so far, it still ends on a downbeat, one that’s sort of rushed in and not explained. I can’t even imagine how we ended up with a Vision-Ultron hybrid in possession of the Infinity Stones and, unless this episode gets a sequel, it doesn’t really matter. The ending is just a non sequitur to affirm, as every episode does, that the regular MCU sequence of events is the “correct one.” It’s tacked on, and makes what was already a messy adventure even worse.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cd5ab590-1c78-11ec-affb-452e5e4a6ee0" alt="Padawan and Jedi Master" data-uuid="42003a17-c357-354c-af54-b91314ad61bc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lucasfilm</div></figure><p>This is where the strength of <em>Star Wars: Visions</em> lies. There’s no attempt to tie the episodes to each other or the larger Star Wars universe. It lets each installment stand on its own as an homage to the larger “ideas” of Star Wars, while also showcasing the idiosyncrasies of each studio. The third episode, “The Twins,” is a great example of this in action. There’s a lightsaber fight on the hull of a Star Destroyer! No one is wearing environmental suits! They’re yelling at each other despite a lack of air! People’s clothes explode off their bodies! It doesn’t make a damn lick of sense, but it doesn’t have to, because it’s not meant to be more than a bit of fun.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-visions-marvel-studios-what-if-season-one-153109359.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9e71fb83-d098-4886-bbda-2698cae54b38</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 15:31:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632426878</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T19:54:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d8142400-1c76-11ec-9fc6-7db93704f496" width="1920" height="816" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d8142400-1c76-11ec-9fc6-7db93704f496" width="1920" height="816" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucasfilm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Girl handles a black-bladed lightsaber]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Star Wars: Visions]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Europe may require all phone manufacturers to use USB-C charging]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Europe may require all manufacturers to use USB-C charging for all phones and electronic devices, according to a new EU Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613">ruling proposal</a>. It aims to reduce e-waste and &quot;consumer inconvenience&quot; caused by different and incompatible chargers still in use. The Commission also wants manufacturers to unbundle the sale of chargers with electronic devices.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;With today&#39;s proposal... USB-C will become the standard port for all smartphones, tablets, cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld videogame consoles,&quot; according to the report.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The EU said its work with industry has managed to reduce the number of mobile phone chargers from 30 to 3 over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-12-29-european-standardization-bodies-formalize-micro-usb-cellphone-ch.html">last decade</a>. One of those three is Apple&#39;s Lightning port used by around 20 percent of devices sold in Europe. The EU hopes to change that situation, according to a statement by executive VP Margrethe Vestager:</p><blockquote><p>European consumers were frustrated long enough about incompatible chargers piling up in their drawers. We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger. This is an important win for our consumers and environment and in line with our green and digital ambitions.</p></blockquote><p>When a common charger was first voted on by the EU <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-european-union-wants-common-charging-cable-standard.html">last year</a>, Apple issued a statement saying that the proposal would &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-23-apple-rejects-eu-call-for-common-phone-charger.html">stifle innovation</a>,&quot; and its position has not changed. &quot;We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,&quot; an Apple spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58665809"><em>BBC</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the launch of the iPhone 12, however, Apple has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-2021-environmental-progress-report-iphone-12-power-adapter-144626760.html">stopped including</a> chargers in the box, something it said would save 861,000 tons of copper, zinc and tin. Apple itself now uses USB-C charging on its latest Mac laptops and certain iPad models, since that standard supports higher voltage charging required for larger devices.</p><p>Nearly all Android smartphones now use USB-C charging, and many models from Samsung and others are sold with charging/data cables but not chargers. It total, around 420 million mobile phones and other portable electronic devices sold in Europe just in the last year.</p><p>The EU throws away 12,000 tons of chargers each year, some unused, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/iphones-may-need-redesign-as-eu-pushes-for-common-charger"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. At the same time, consumers spend around 2.4 billion euros ($2.8 billion) on standalone chargers not included with devices. The law is still in the proposal stages and needs to be passed by EU lawmakers and governments, so it could come into force around two years after that.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/europe-proposes-usb-c-as-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices-131605815.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b5a41212-fbbf-4825-9b4f-6ecbe5b48669</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 13:16:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632402968</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T13:16:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f4d810a0-1c68-11ec-97ee-bdaf0c2ff766" width="4000" height="2654" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f4d810a0-1c68-11ec-97ee-bdaf0c2ff766" width="4000" height="2654" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vadym  Plysiuk via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Man connecting USB Type C Port Cable for charging to the smartphone.

Kirk and his crew occasionally faced off against computers gone amok, including <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Nomad">Nomad</a>, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Landru_(machine)">Landru</a> and the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/M-5_multitronic_unit">M-5</a>. The only way to defeat these digital villains was to outwit them using logic, which caused them to self-destruct. But in <em>The Next Generation</em>, the franchise became more interested in exploring the personhood of artificial beings like <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Data">Data</a> and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Lal">his</a><a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Lore">family</a>, <em>Voyager</em>’s <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Doctor">holographic doctor</a> or the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Exocomp">exocomps</a>. This week, <em>Lower Decks</em> dredges up the old-style megalomaniacal AI and asks, are you really sure about those rights?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>USS Cerritos</em> is once more called upon to help out a civilization enslaved by an evil computer, this one called Agimus (voiced by long-time Trek actor Jeffrey Combs). Disconnected from his network of drones, he’s actually pretty pathetic, desperately begging the organic beings around him to just hook him up to a computer. All that’s left for Starfleet to do is to drop him off at the Daystrom Institute, which isn’t the most glamorous of jobs, so of course Beckett Mariner and Bradward Boimler end up on this particular babysitting gig.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6747baa0-1b15-11ec-befe-01ad643a0094" style="height:675;width:1200;" alt="" data-uuid="9dc9a6fe-b0df-3c1b-8f0d-8f7da5c9a029"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>A gravimetric shear complicates things for the pair, forcing their shuttle to crash on a barren world with only the pleading voice of Agimus to keep them company. The computer uses this opportunity to pit the two against each other, continuing a plot thread that we thought had been settled two episodes ago. Beckett still doesn’t trust Brad&#39;s abilities despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-four-070120756.html">all they’ve</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-070123812.html">been through</a>. It feels like a regression or perhaps even a mis-scheduled episode, except that we the audience still see his growth while his supposed best friend doubts him. It’s a plot line unlikely to go away after a few episodes, reaffirming this show’s commitment to character-driven storytelling.</p><p>However, that breadth of characterization doesn’t really apply to Agimus. He’s really just… kind of a jerk, and he doesn’t have the ability to directly influence anything due to his lack of arms and legs. Boimler and Mariner spend the entire episode lugging his box around: a sentient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>. If you’re not familiar with that term, it means an item (or person) that moves the plot forward and motivates the characters, but is not actually important in itself. With Agimus’s reign over, he really just serves here to get Mariner and Boimler at each other’s throats.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/42e1cc00-1b15-11ec-adbf-2104cc27ab8d" style="height:675;width:1200;" alt="" data-uuid="4f10a205-4e76-3010-a036-53e886aadc79"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p></p><p>His status as a sentient being is never in question, but the problem of what to do with him as his behavior worsens goes in directions that would never come up for an organic individual. Mariner suggests burying him, a suggestion turned down by Boimler because he’s a sentient being and that’s not what Starfleet does. So it seems we have made some progress from the ol’ “destroy them with their own logic” days of <em>TOS</em>. But then the two ensigns end up burying him anyway, while Agamus protests that “he has rights!”</p><p>And yet Star Trek has always been a bit sketchy about what those rights are. While episodes like “<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Measure_Of_A_Man_(episode)">The Measure of a Man</a>” and “<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Offspring_(episode)">The Offspring</a>” have reaffirmed Data’s humanity, it’s been contradicted since by events on <em>Voyager</em> and <em>Picard</em>. The Doctor asserted <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Author,_Author_(episode)">his authorial rights to a holonovel he created and won</a>, but wasn’t actually recognized as a person. The question <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-star-trek-picard-technology-evolution.html">remained unanswered</a> nearly 20 years later on <em>Picard</em>, with us only being shown holograms of limited capabilities, or those based on the personalities of other sentient beings (Rios’ crew). And fully synthetic beings like Data, ones with brains <em>and</em> bodies, were illegal after the attack on Mars.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/84867430-1b15-11ec-b7be-eb71c85bddb1" style="height:675;width:1200;" alt="" data-uuid="24be9bec-ac44-3c75-937e-7c468548ceb2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p><em>Lower Decks</em> takes place a mere year after the end of <em>Voyager</em>, so it’s free to pick up and explore some of those plot threads without that later baggage. But without a synthetic crew member on the <em>USS Cerritos</em> it can only glance off the subject. Agamus is dumped in a storage facility as just another “self-aware megalomaniacal computer,” not too dissimilar from <a href="https://youtu.be/TASlXWbMZyU">the warehouse</a> where the Ark of the Covenant is dumped at the end of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>. Is it a prison? Did he get a trial? Are he and the other computers just going to sit there until the end of the Federation? From an ethical perspective it isn’t great, but it’s unlikely to ever be fully addressed, because who in Starfleet is really going to fight for the personhood of a computerized fascist dictator?</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-seven-130034380.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c92b204-e76a-486d-80f2-c744968da0b5</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 13:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632254575</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T20:03:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e8b53b90-1b14-11ec-adde-8ac8b3144b18" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e8b53b90-1b14-11ec-adde-8ac8b3144b18" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Where Pleasant Fountains Lie"  Epi#207 -- Jerry O\'Connell as Commander and Jeffrey Combs as Agimus (computer) of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

They&#39;re the first models to run the new &quot;Wear OS powered by Samsung,&quot; which allows you to download apps from the Play Store directly to your wrist. While the Classic has a spinning bezel and the non-Classic models don&#39;t, both versions feature upgraded biometric sensors, a body composition scanner and improved sleep tracking. The watches also come with gesture controls that let you answer or dismiss calls by flicking your wrist or lifting your arm.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung just released a much pricier <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-classic-thom-browne-020036074.html">Thom Browne Edition</a> Galaxy Watch 4 Classic.

Most interesting, of course, is likely Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-easel-hinge-153618416.html"><ins>Surface Laptop Studio</ins></a>, a notebook with a screen that pulls forward just like its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-21-surface-studio-2-review.html"><ins>desktop namesake</ins></a>. This replacement for the Surface Book 3 also turns into a tablet-esque PC, although its stacked design may divide users.</p><p>As we surmised a few days back, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-13-inch-screen-dolby-vision-150951070.html"><ins>Surface Pro 8</ins></a> did get a fairly magnificent redesign with a new skinny-bezel, 13-inch 120Hz display, Thunderbolt 4 and new, faster internals. It’s been built with Windows 11 in mind and goes on sale when the new operating system arrives on October 5th. Thankfully, Microsoft allowed our chum Cherlynn Low behind the velvet rope to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-hands-on-surface-pro-8-pro-x-go-3-adaptive-kit-price-specs-160005455.html"><ins>spend a little time with the Laptop Studio and Pro 8, so read this for all the juicy details</ins></a>.</p><p>Much as with the band U2, we also need to discuss the “other two” members of the lineup, the Surface Pro X and the Surface Go 3. For the former, the only real news is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-x-wifi-only-899-usd-151558748.html"><ins>new, cheaper WiFi-only model, which retails for $899</ins></a>, and the bundling of Windows 11. Similarly, the Surface Go 3 (arguably the Larry Mullen Jr. of Surface tablets) gets faster chip options but is, in most other regards, the same affordable but deeply underpowered device we already know and, uh, <em>love</em>.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-hands-on-price-specs-buggy-update-triple-camera-160008199.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb251380-1c5b-11ec-bb87-c174e905a4cd" style="height:450;width:675;" alt="Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="c663c007-c55a-3400-94dc-d1548818c6e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low</div></figure></a><p>On the mobile front, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-annoucement-152736648.html"><ins>Surface Duo 2</ins></a>, its second-generation dual-screen Android smartphone. The most notable upgrade for this year is a triple camera system and a notification bar on the hinge, so you can see what’s going on without opening your phone.

It’s a set of add-ons that can help people with accessibility needs get around their Surface devices more easily. That includes raised port indicators, cable wraps and labels to help your fingers land on regularly used keys.

The team tested multiple versions that could carry payloads like antenna so that they could wireless communicate with a smartphone or each other. Other sensors could monitor things like air acidity, water quality and solar radiation.&nbsp;</p><p>The flyers are still concepts right now and not ready to deploy into the atmosphere, but the team plans to expand their findings with different designs. Key to that is the use of biodegradable materials so they wouldn&#39;t persist in the environment.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t think about these devices... as a permanent monitoring componentry but rather temporary ones that are addressing a particular need that’s of finite time duration,&quot; Rogers said. “That&#39;s the way that we&#39;re envisioning things currently: you monitor for a month and then the devices die out, dissolve, and disappear, and maybe you have to redeploy them.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nature-inspired-robots-are-among-the-tiniest-flying-devices-yet-100825751.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">09bcb4b9-2d58-43b8-9a68-5311e97bd19f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 10:08:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632391707</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T10:08:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61c86ce0-1c4c-11ec-9dce-ae314718b4f0" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61c86ce0-1c4c-11ec-9dce-ae314718b4f0" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nature]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nature-inspired robots are among the tiniest flying devices yet]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nature-inspired robots are among the tiniest flying devices yet]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox Insiders' 360 gamerpics now display properly on modern consoles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re attached to your Xbox 360 gamerpic but hate how that it looks <a href="https://twitter.com/noukon/status/1428469278068539394">small and ridiculous</a> on modern consoles, don&#39;t change it for a newer one just yet. Microsoft developer Eden Marie has announced that a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/your-tiny-xbox-360-gamerpic-may-finally-display-properly-on-modern-consoles-103031164.html">recent fix</a> for Xbox 360 gamerpics on newer consoles is now rolling out to Insiders, so everyone should get it soon.&nbsp;</p><div id="3c25814ee9ca415ca4b94c8dd378a53c"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey all, I know a bunch of you were asking for a way to go back to your Xbox 360 gamerpic.

Marie and others engineers originally fixed the issue by scaling the icons to the right size, fitting their square shape into modern round gamerpic (rather than cutting off the corners) and even using transparency for a more seamless appearance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to a <a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1440557049692114949">tweet</a> from Marie, the transparency fix was &quot;walked back a bit due to user feedback that the square images looked too different from normal gamerpics.&quot; Rather, the circle is now semi-transparent. It will only show up if you&#39;ve ever had an Xbox 360 gamerpic, &quot;and if your current gamerpic isn&#39;t already your Xbox 360 gamerpic,&quot; she said. Once set, any changes you make on an Xbox 360 console will &quot;automatically carry over.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The fix arrived first to the Xbox Alpha Ring, but has now hit the Insider ring starting with Alpha Skip Ahead users. Pending more feedback and possible changes, it should work its way up the Insider ring levels and arrive to all users in the near future.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsofts-xbox-360-gamerpic-fix-for-new-consoles-rolls-out-to-insiders-082303696.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5cf73c2f-a620-4f5b-81f9-4e211a97e678</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 08:23:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632385620</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T08:27:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/22ed53b0-1c46-11ec-9f7f-00bc66ab0464" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/22ed53b0-1c46-11ec-9f7f-00bc66ab0464" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eden Marie]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft's Xbox 360 gamerpic fix for new consoles rolls out to Insiders]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft's Xbox 360 gamerpic fix for new consoles rolls out to Insiders]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[California governor signs warehouse productivity quota bill into law]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>California governor Gavin Newsom has <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/22/governor-newsom-signs-nation-leading-legislation-expanding-protections-for-warehouse-workers/">signed</a> AB-701, the bill that aims to regulate warehouse <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-california-warehouse-worker-quotas-bill-191234363.html">productivity quotas</a>, into law. As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/22/amazon-california-productivity-quotas/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> notes, that makes California the first state to put a restriction on productivity quotas in warehouses like Amazon&#39;s, and it could lead to better conditions for workers. After the law takes effect on January 1st, 2022, companies will be required to have transparency around productivity quotas. They have to disclose those quotas to their workers and provide authorities with a detailed description of the targets workers are expected to meet.</p><p>In addition, it will prohibit the use of algorithms that prevent workers from being able to take state-mandated meal and bathroom breaks or force them to do things that aren&#39;t in compliance with health and safety laws. Workers can&#39;t be fired or retaliated against for failing to meet unsafe quotas, as well. In his office&#39;s announcement, Gov. Newson said in a statement:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;We cannot allow corporations to put profit over people. The hardworking warehouse employees who have helped sustain us during these unprecedented times should not have to risk injury or face punishment as a result of exploitative quotas that violate basic health and safety. I&#39;m proud to sign this legislation giving them the dignity, respect and safety they deserve and advancing California&#39;s leadership at the forefront of workplace safety.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The bill&#39;s proponents had Amazon in mind when they wrote it up. Amazon&#39;s warehouse workers previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-amazon-minimum-wage-15-dollars.html">spoke out</a> about having to urinate in bottles just so they wouldn&#39;t have to be disciplined for &quot;idle time.&quot; The e-commerce giant also has a massive injury rate, because workers are expected to be able to keep up with the machines they&#39;re working with.&nbsp;</p><p>California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, the bill&#39;s author, <a href="https://a80.asmdc.org/press-releases/20210922-governor-signs-gonzalez-bill-creating-nations-first-protections-against">said</a> in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This bill is simply about giving workers some basic dignity back and empowering them to keep themselves safe. As workers are increasingly surveilled on the job and supervised by algorithms, AB 701 is just the beginning of our work to regulate dangerous quotas and keep employers that have operated above the law in check.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, however, previously denied that the company has unreasonable productivity quotas. In a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders">letter</a> to shareholders back in April, he said that employees are &quot;are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts&quot; and that the company doesn&#39;t set &quot;unreasonable performance goals.&quot; He added: &quot;We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-warehouse-productivity-quota-law-052141689.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02f2fefa-1d79-4dd9-8051-f245f4802db9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 05:21:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632379917</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T06:52:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1f224820-1c29-11ec-bbf5-a3747e8ba0c1" width="7552" height="5035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1f224820-1c29-11ec-bbf5-a3747e8ba0c1" width="7552" height="5035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MediaNews Group/The Riverside Press-Enterprise via Getty Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[EASTVALE, CA - AUGUST 31: Amnesty technician Gustavo Morales controls logistics robots at Amazon fulfillment center in Eastvale on Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2021.
