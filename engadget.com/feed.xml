The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en_US/games/detail/twitch-switch/">free app</a> offers the same core functionality as Twitch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-26-twitch-ps4-app-overhaul.html">on other consoles</a>, including on-demand videos. However, the Switch&#39;s nature might give it an edge — you can watch docked if you want the largest screen possible, or handheld if you have the itch to tune in from bed.</p><p>There is a potential hitch in the Switch version, though. As you might have predicted, this Twitch app is strictly for viewing. You can&#39;t natively broadcast your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-hands-on-130040843.html"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a> session, and you certainly can&#39;t show your face when there&#39;s no selfie camera.

While Nintendo hasn&#39;t been adamantly opposed to Twitch, former president Reggie Fils-Aime told <em>Polygon</em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/6/12/5802560/nintendos-fils-aime-wii-u-wont-get-twitch-gameplay-streaming-because">in 2014</a> that the company preferred more focused video sharing instead of simply streaming whatever you happened to be playing. The video game pioneer also has a long history of trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-27-nintendo-planning-youtube-revenue-splitting-affiliate-program.html">control online videos</a> and share profits from video producers&#39; work. Although Nintendo has softened its stance since then, it&#39;s not exactly in a rush to make Twitch a two-way affair.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-app-nintendo-switch-190506686.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3fc6a3c9-830b-4fcd-97ad-62109403bc92</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 19:05:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636657277</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T19:01:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/79c176b0-431c-11ec-9b0f-7d52b3a9f14a" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/79c176b0-431c-11ec-9b0f-7d52b3a9f14a" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitch]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitch app for Nintendo Switch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitch app for Nintendo Switch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Panic's Playdate handheld is delayed until 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-delayed-february-2022-195957878.html"><ins>Steam Deck</ins></a> isn’t the only handheld that won’t ship in 2021.

GM Defense president Steve duMont <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/gm-plans-to-produce-military-vehicle-based-on-hummer-ev-in-2022.html">told <em>CNBC</em></a> the company planned to build a military vehicle prototype based on the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmcs-newly-unveiled-hummer-ev-suv-is-830-hp-of-electric-supertruck-220323684.html">Hummer EV</a>. The eLRV, or electric Light Reconnaissance Vehicle, would modify the Hummer&#39;s frame, motors and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-reveals-the-ultium-motors-that-are-key-to-its-all-electric-shift-120029040.html">Ultium batteries</a> to suit US military requirements.</p><p>The prototype should be ready sometime in 2022. There&#39;s no guarantee American armed forces will use the eLRV, however. The Army is still exploring the viability of EVs like this, and GM will have to meet formal requirements (along with a rival manufacturer) if and when they exist. A choice is due sometime in the mid-2020s.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Any military EV faces logistical challenges, at least for machines on the front lines. Soldiers couldn&#39;t just find a charging station on the battlefield, for starters — they&#39;d need transportable charging systems that aren&#39;t dependent on a working electrical grid. DuMont said GM could provide combustion-powered charging systems. We&#39;d add that temperatures significantly affect EV range, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gogoro-launches-its-battery-swapping-tech-in-china-080359215.html">swappable batteries</a> (important for quick turnarounds and repairs) are still in their relative infancy.</p><p>There could be advantages to military EV adoption. They might improve overall emissions, even if the need for combustion-based chargers partly offset that advantage. EVs generally require less maintenance due to fewer moving parts. And their quiet operation could be extremely useful for recon and stealth missions where conventional rides would be too noisy. The challenge is to make the most of these advantages while minimizing drawbacks that could hurt operational speeds.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-hummer-ev-military-vehicle-elrv-181909646.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5f97825-8418-4b7a-8319-b6d93ce77088</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 18:19:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636654218</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T18:10:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Military & Defense]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d2190f20-4313-11ec-bffe-3dc7aa709d1c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d2190f20-4313-11ec-bffe-3dc7aa709d1c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Fecht for GM Defense]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GM Defense President Steve duMont talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks Monday, Nov. 8, 2021 at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GM Defense President Steve duMont talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Discord pauses NFT plans following community backlash]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Discord doesn’t have impending plans to add NFT integrations, according to CEO Jason Citron. The clarification came on Wednesday following days of unrest stemming from a tweet Citron shared on November 8th. Replying to a message from investor Packy McCormick, the executive <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1457841222995693570?s=20"><ins>posted a screenshot</ins></a> of an unreleased Discord build with integrations to MetaMask and WalletConnect, two cryptocurrency wallet apps. “Probably nothing,” he said at the time.

The backlash was such that by Wednesday Citron and Discord were forced to issue a response. “Thanks for all the perspectives everyone,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699?s=20"><ins>said on Twitter</ins></a>. “We have no current plans to ship this internal concept.”</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, Discord shared an additional clarification:</p><blockquote><p>“We appreciate all the perspectives we’ve been hearing in response to the internal concept you may have seen in a tweet earlier this week and want to clarify we have no plans to ship it at this time.

In 2018, Google released the Pixel Slate, its attempt to jumpstart the market, but poorly optimized software and expensive hardware <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-30-google-pixel-slate-review.html">made the device a non-starter </a>for most people. Since then, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-20-google-is-giving-up-on-tablets.html">stopped making tablets entirely</a>, while most manufacturers making Chrome OS devices have also stuck with more traditional designs.</p><p>That started to change last year, when Lenovo built an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-150018759.html">inexpensive but useful Chrome OS tablet</a>, the Chromebook Duet. This year, HP has followed a similar pattern with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP Chromebook X2" href="https://fave.co/31MYhaR">HP Chromebook X2</a>, an 11-inch tablet that’s pricier and higher-end than Lenovo’s Duet (the model I’m reviewing costs $600). But, like the Duet, it uses a mobile processor (in this case, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c) and includes a keyboard and pen at no extra charge. Based purely on specs and design, the Chromebook X2 should be a fine performer — but is its convertible form factor worth the premium over a more standard laptop?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><h2></h2><p>We’ll get into how useful Chrome OS tablets are soon, but based purely on hardware alone, HP’s Chromebook X2 makes a great first impression. The tablet itself is a metal-clad slap that feels sturdy and well built. There’s a small camera bump on the back, along with metallic HP and Chrome logos, but overall it’s a simple device with few adornments. The device has squared-off sides with rounded corners, much like the iPad Pro and iPad Air, but it feels different enough from those devices despite the fact there are only so many ways to make a tablet.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a25a051-423e-11ec-8ebf-9cb08ad67941" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="5eade824-2648-3bfb-af4e-bf772055466f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>When looking at the front, you’ll notice a small camera on the top bezel, with stereo speakers positioned near the top of the screen. On the left side edge you’ll find two USB-C ports and a volume rocker. In the top left corner there’s a multi-function power button with a fingerprint reader. When you’re using the Chromebook X2 with a keyboard attached, pressing the power button shows options to shut down, log out or lock the device. When you’re using it as a tablet, though, the button has the more standard “lock the device and turn off the screen” function. The fingerprint scanner is easy to set up, and I wish that more Chromebooks had them.</p><p>The right side of the tablet is basically unadorned, aside from a mark that shows where you can magnetically attach the Chromebook X2’s pen to its side for easy access. The iPad Pro and various Microsoft Surface devices also let you magnetically attach a stylus, so this isn’t really a big innovation — but it’s still nice to have.</p><p>When I reviewed the Pixel Slate back in 2018, my main takeaway was that Chrome OS still required a keyboard. As such, I was glad to find that the Chromebook X2 had one included. To turn the X2 from a tablet into a functional laptop, HP designed a two-piece case. The keyboard cover goes on the front, much like Microsoft’s Surface Keyboard. But instead of having a built-in kickstand, the X2 has a second cover that serves as a kickstand which magnetically snaps on to the back. Once you have that set, the X2 is basically identical to the Microsoft Surface Go, at least in looks.</p><p>The Chromebook X2’s keyboard is pretty good considering it has to fit a relatively small device. The keys have solid travel and are quite responsive, though they’re a little bit loud. It feels a little cramped, but not any worse than the Surface Go’s keyboard. But it definitely feels more cramped than the Magic Keyboard I use with my 11-inch iPad Pro. (That’s a $300 accessory, though, so it really should be better than a keyboard HP includes with every X2.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a23cb90-423e-11ec-b7ed-4ae9258f1117" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="23095154-2083-32b7-bd67-31f697e0ad0a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The main issue with the X2 keyboard is that it’s not ideal for using on your lap. As I’ve noticed with some other keyboard folios, applying just a little pressure on palm rests often causes the trackpad to register a click, which can be infuriating when you’re, say, typing a review and keep getting interrupted. It’s much better on a desk, where the keyboard is more stable. Microsoft’s Type Cover for the Surface lineup doesn’t have this problem, so it’s just a matter of build quality in the end. And for a small, light device meant to be used on the go, having a keyboard that only works on a hard, flat surface is less than ideal.</p><p>Despite occasional accidental clicks, the X2 trackpad is pretty good. It’s larger than the one on the iPad Pro’s Magic Keyboard and as well as the Surface Go’s keyboard, and it’s fast and responsive for both single-finger and multi-finger gestures. It’s still pretty small, though, so you might prefer an external mouse for extended work sessions.</p><p>The Chromebook X2 may be a small machine, but its 11-inch touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio is a standout. It’s a high-resolution display, coming in at 2,160 x 1,440, and the taller aspect ratio makes it feel a lot less cramped for work than a 16:9 screen would, especially at this smaller size. It’s also a very bright screen, almost painfully so — even when working in a sunny office, I rarely turned brightness up higher than halfway.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, HP included a stylus with the Chromebook X2. I’m no visual artist, so I’m not qualified to really judge its performance — but there’s no question stylus performance on this device lags behind Microsoft&#39;s Surface Go 3 and any iPad I’ve tried. But again, HP included a stylus for free, whereas Microsoft and Apple charge extra for it. That doesn’t make performance better, but at least you’re not shelling out additional cash for a sub-par experience. The pen might be fine for quick sketches or notes, but it doesn’t feel like something I’d want to use for very long.</p><h2>Tablet mode</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a25ee70-423e-11ec-853e-c4ee762ff3d1" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="a5f74fbd-9f1f-3c7e-b1a6-4a2f7d6f668a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Even though there aren’t many Chrome OS tablets, Google has made improvements to the OS’s tablet mode over the years. It’s quite a bit more stable and user-friendly than it was when the Pixel Slate came out in 2018; the main UI concepts are a mix of what you’ll find on iPadOS and Windows. Apps automatically launch in full screen, and the home screen is a grid of all the apps you have installed. Swiping up when you’re using an app brings you back to the home screen, and a more deliberate swipe from the bottom shows the Chrome OS dock. Finally, you can run two apps in  split-screen mode when you want to multitask.</p><p>I haven’t used the Chrome OS tablet mode in a while. I’ve reviewed a ton of Chromebooks with 360-degree hinges that can be used in tablet mode, but they’re usually too heavy for that. But the Chromebook X2 feels great in the hand;  with its 11-inch screen and a weight of 1.23 pounds, it’s not too big or heavy to be used as a tablet. The main issue with Chrome OS on a tablet is familiar to anyone who has used Android tablets: there just isn’t much software optimized for a large screen. That said, using the X2 to casually browse the web, watch videos and play the occasional game worked well. HP knows that this isn’t the primary way anyone should use a Chrome OS device, hence the included keyboard — but for casual couch browsing or watching a movie on a plan, the X2 does the trick.</p><h2>As a laptop</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a23cb90-423e-11ec-adfe-c09450ee5aaf" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="2f09af69-415a-3a62-90fa-37698c53fd7d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>The main way I used the Chromebook X2 was as a laptop, with the included keyboard attached. The biggest question I had was whether the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c processor was enough for my normal workflow. The answer was “more or less.” The X2 ran better than I expected, and I could usually have most of my normal apps running at all times. That means a couple Chrome windows with a handful of tabs in each, plus Chrome apps for Slack, Todoist, Keep, Trello and Tweetdeck. I also often had the Android version of Spotify running for music.</p><p>This all ran acceptably, but it definitely wasn’t the fastest — particularly if I had too many Chrome tabs going. The X2 that I tested has 8GB of RAM, and that helped keep most of my programs running without the need to refresh when I switched between them, but I ended up instinctively limiting how many tabs I had going at any given time to avoid pushing the X2 too hard. I also didn’t play music directly from the X2 much when I was running a lot of other apps, as I eventually would run into slowdowns or low memory skips if I had too much going on.</p><p>While I wish performance was a little better, it’s important to look at it in the context of how HP designed the device. Given its small size, I thought of it more as a secondary or travel computer rather than something most people would sit down and use for hours on end every single day. The display is certainly too small and performance not quite robust enough for me to use it that way, anyway.</p><p>One advantage of using a Snapdragon processor is that the Chromebook X2 had excellent battery life. While it’s too small of a computer for me to comfortably use all day long, I routinely got around eight hours of work when I used it as my primary machine, and still had charge left at the end of the day. It also performed extremely well in our battery drain test, which loops an HD video with the screen set at 50 percent brightness. The X2 lasted about 11 and a half hours in that test, which means this device should be a solid movie-watching companion if you’re on a long flight.</p><p>At only 1.23 pounds as a tablet and a little over 2.25 pounds with the keyboard and kickstand attached, the Chromebook X2 is an extremely portable computer for when you don’t need the full size and power that you get in a larger laptop. It again reminds me of Microsoft’s Surface Go 3, not just in the way it looks. Both devices are a bit underpowered, and I wouldn’t recommend either be someone’s primary computer. But, they can be great secondary computers if you’re aware of their limitations.</p><h2>Pricing and the competition</h2><h2></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a23f2a0-423e-11ec-bd9f-744075de96a9" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="3b1cdf7d-b4e0-38f2-b189-5e65f76033d5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Of course, price is a big part of the equation. That was probably the biggest problem with the Surface Go 3 when I reviewed it recently: The kit I tested cost $860, and for that money it should be powerful enough to use as your only computer. But the Chromebook X2 is cheaper; the model I reviewed costs $600. That gets you the aforementioned Snapdragon 7c processor, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, the keyboard and pen. And the X2 has already been on sale numerous times at Best Buy for only $400. At that price, it’s a pretty great portable secondary computer.</p><p>At $600, it’s a little pricey for what you get, though. That’s mostly because you can buy a larger, more powerful Chromebook for a little more money. Both the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 and Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 cost $700 and come with faster Intel chips, better keyboards and larger displays. You have to be really committed to the tablet form factor to not give those computers a look instead. Or, you can get Lenovo’s Flex 5 Chromebook for only $300 on Amazon as of this writing; you’ll save yourself money and have a better overall experience. If you can find the Chromebook X2 on sale for $400, it’s a much more compelling buy, but it’s still not the best Chromebook in that price range.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a25a050-423e-11ec-ba7f-43d9bb8191f3" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="01c7b7d1-201b-3d42-a16b-b37a1fc438e0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><h2></h2><p>The main issue with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Chromebook X2" href="https://fave.co/31MYhaR">Chromebook X2</a> is neither its price nor its performance. It’s the fact that most people will be better served with a standard, laptop-style Chromebook. Sure, most Chromebooks are a little bigger and heavier than the X2, but they’re also generally more powerful and have better keyboards. The X2 only makes sense if you value portability and battery life over performance. If you can find the X2 for $400, it’s worth considering if you’re a Chrome OS user looking for a secondary computer that you can take with you anywhere. Otherwise, you’re probably better off considering one of the many other Chromebooks on the market.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hp-chromebook-x2-review-162005261.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">739ab1d7-972c-49aa-aa7a-c569491e2f58</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:20:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636651615</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T17:27:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tablets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a268ab0-423e-11ec-bbff-816c3abcb4d2" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a268ab0-423e-11ec-bbff-816c3abcb4d2" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HP's Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HP Chromebook X2 review photos]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Radiohead's virtual 'Kid A Mnesia' exhibit is available November 18th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;ll soon have the chance to visit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/radiohead-and-epic-games-team-up-for-the-kid-a-mnesia-exhibit-215738766.html">Radiohead&#39;s virtual exhibition</a>. The band and Epic Games are releasing <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em> for free on November 18th for PS5, Windows PC and Mac. You can wishlist it on the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/kid-a-mnesia-exhibition">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003085/">PlayStation Store</a>. As you can see from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkqVeyhdLYI">trailer</a>, the finished project is just what you&#39;d expect — it&#39;s a trippy 3D art gallery that blends <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-20-radiohead-public-library-and-rarities.html">Radiohead&#39;s music</a> from <em>Kid A</em> and <em>Amnesiac</em> (including new sound design from Nigel Godrich) with the unsettling artwork of Thom Yorke and Stanley Donwood.</p><p>The exhibit was originally meant to be physical, but a combination of &quot;laws of zoning and physics and COVID-19&quot; (according to Epic) pushed it to the digital realm. Radiohead, Godrich and Donwood teamed with Namethemachine, Arbitrarily Good Productions, artist Sean Evans and theater set designer Christine Jones to create the exhibition. Epic is publishing the end result.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is clearly a plug for the <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> album that includes both albums and a string of previously unreleased material. At the same time, it might be worthwhile even if you&#39;re only casually familiar with Radiohead&#39;s tunes. This is a rare chance to explore a legendary group&#39;s music and imagery well beyond the usual confines of an album, and more on your own terms.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/radiohead-epic-kid-a-mnesia-virtual-exhibition-release-date-160006913.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">079b4507-b336-43c3-af26-e3384673ac95</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636660619</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T19:57:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b04b620-42fd-11ec-b4ae-b11fad84d240" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b04b620-42fd-11ec-b4ae-b11fad84d240" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Namethemachine/Arbitrarily Good Productions/Epic Games/Radiohead]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Radiohead 'Kid A Mnesia' virtual exhibition]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Radiohead 'Kid A Mnesia' virtual exhibition]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox PC app will soon let you use mods and custom install folders]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Much like <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/steam"><ins>Steam</ins></a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epic%20games%20store/"><ins>Epic Games Store</ins></a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-pc-app-remote-console-play-game-pass-cloud-gaming-153728842.html"><ins>Xbox PC app</ins></a> will soon let folks install games in any folder of their choosing.

A prime example is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-oled-notebooks-proart-zenbook-vivobook-160009335.html">Studiobook 16 OLED H5600 laptop</a>, tempting artists with high performance, a beautiful 16-inch 4K OLED display, and an “ASUS dial” for video or photo editing.</p><p>ASUS’s previous ProArt laptops like the StudioBook One were workstation-like creator devices with expensive parts like NVIDIA Quadro 6000 GPUs. With this model, ASUS is focusing more on bang-for-the buck with components like an RTX 3070 GPU and AMD Ryzen 9 eight-core CPU. (The more expensive <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:StudioBook 16 Pro" href="https://fave.co/3kuNUyZ">StudioBook 16 Pro</a> models offer Xeon processors and Quadro GPUs.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The question is, can a reasonably priced laptop like this keep up with more expensive models or even high-end gaming laptops when it comes to performance? To find out, I got a hold of a well-specced but modestly priced Studiobook 16 OLED model and put it to work on some photo and video editing jobs.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5c977582-7e9e-4c34-a794-a198f15b01cc"/><p>A key feature of all the Studiobook devices is the businesslike looks that are far away from ASUS’s gaming designs. To that end, it has a basic black, square-edged body with the only noticeable design touch being the subtle ProArt logo on top. It has bezels that are reasonably small but not what I’d call thin, and isn’t the lightest or smallest 16-inch laptop out there. Still, with a .77-inch thickness and 5.28 pound heft, it’s relatively compact — especially considering that it offers “military-grade durability” (MIL-STD 810H), according to ASUS.</p><p>ASUS has developed an “IceCool Pro” thermal solution that’s supposed to boost airflow by up to 16 percent, while keeping noise levels below 40 dbA in standard cooling mode. It does that through the use of dual 102-blade fans, six heat pipes and multiple ducts.</p><p>If you need more punch, you can switch to performance mode which boosts power to 95 watts, or up to 135 watts in “full-speed” mode. Fan noise is still reasonable in performance mode unless you’re doing GPU/CPU intensive chores, but the full-speed setting can get very loud indeed. Still, it could be a handy mode if you’re planning to leave the room while doing a render. Overall, heat and noise are very well managed.</p><p>The headline feature on this laptop is the 3,480 x 2,400 16:10 OLED display, the first on a 16-inch laptop, ASUS claims. As you’d expect, it’s sharp, vibrant and beautiful in person — by far the best laptop display I’ve ever seen in terms of fidelity and “wow” factor.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04dfdc50-4241-11ec-bfff-96ac54a6957d" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="4e23971a-03e8-3e33-adda-d789a9ce9a7f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The panel is factory-calibrated to Pantone and Calman color accuracy, with a delta E of less than two, a fact that I confirmed with my X-Rite i1 Display Pro calibrator. I used it with a $4,000 ASUS mini-LED ProArt monitor and despite the display technology differences, they matched very closely to my eyes, color wise.</p><p>The true 10-bit panel offers 100 percent DCI-P3 color coverage, in workstation laptop territory and well beyond rivals like the MacBook Pro (78 percent) and Dell’s XPS 15 (85 percent). Along with the color accuracy, that allows for precise color correction controls in apps like DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Lightroom Classic. The 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio with inky OLED blacks also makes it ideal for content creation, with a side benefit that it’s the best entertainment laptop I’ve ever used.</p><p>Given that the display is suitable for color correction, ASUS should have perhaps included a way to easily change the color profile for video editing ( Rec.709, DCI-P3 and so on) or photos (AdobeRGB, sRGB). That could be a handy setting in the Creator Hub, for example, or at least as an .icm profile for Windows Color Management.</p><p>You can crank the brightness up to 550 nits in HDR mode, so it conforms to VESA’s DisplayHDR <a href="https://displayhdr.org/#tab-true-black-500">True Black 500</a> standard for OLED displays — very bright indeed for a laptop display. However, it’s well short of the 1,600 nits peak brightness available on the latest MacBook Pros, which use mini-LED displays. That raises the question of whether OLED or mini-LED is more desirable on a creator laptop, but personally, I’d take the superior OLED blacks over eye-scorching brightness and haloing.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04cb1bd0-4241-11ec-a776-ac799f77b799" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="adae389f-a276-36c5-be1b-92cc798b4ba2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The other attention-grabbing feature is the ProArt Dial. I wouldn’t blame you for thinking it’s a gimmick, as it takes up space and adds complexity. Also, similar control surfaces can look cool but often end up in drawers, never to be used.</p><p>This one has a few things in its favor, though. It feels nice thanks to the textured grip, smooth rotation and clicky detents. Mainly, though, it’s just convenient as it’s located directly below the keyboard. In that way, it makes more sense than something like Microsoft’s Surface Dial or an external <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-10-palette-video-editing-controls-hands-on.html">control surface</a>, as those are usually placed outside easy grabbing distance.</p><p>With no apps loaded, you can use the dial to turn up the sound or increase monitor brightness more easily than using the function keys. To make the most of it, though, you really need Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite. With Photoshop open, pressing the dial launches a dedicated pie chart-like menu with “slices” for brush options, layer zoom, and so on. Pressing it again on the brush menu, for instance, opens sub-options for hardness, flow, opacity and more. Premiere and After Effects have similar custom menus.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04caf4c1-4241-11ec-ba59-871681a7807c" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="94ca8ad6-7681-331d-9e20-2d010ee888f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>If the stock menus won’t do, you can go into the ASUS ProArt Creator Hub software. There, you can reprogram the functions the way you’d prefer via drop-down menus. As it stands now, the dial only supports four Adobe apps: Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects and Lightroom Classic. As someone who uses other apps, particularly DaVinci Resolve, I’m hoping ASUS will add more down the road.</p><p>I’ve used control surfaces in the past as part of my former video editor career, but I haven’t been a big fan of them on PCs. However, after trying the ASUS dial with Photoshop and Premiere Pro, I got used to it pretty fast. It was natural to keep one hand on the keyboard and the other on the dial to jog video, swap tools and so on. Before long, it was second nature and sped up my workflow.</p><p>Moving to the front of the laptop, the trackpad is smooth, responsive and sports not just two, but three buttons — taking me back to the 2000s when all PC mice had this. The third one adds an extra control that could be useful for 3D or CAD apps, video editing to mark “in” points and so on. It’s also the first laptop touchpad from ASUS that supports styluses using the MPP 1.51 standard, which includes its own. That allows artists to use the touchpad as a precise drawing tablet. I wasn’t able to make use of this functionality myself (I can’t really draw), but it’s nice to have it there.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04ff4b32-4241-11ec-b96b-ee865275a588" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="d44f6703-5900-327a-b305-201ac0acfdbc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The keyboard has decent travel and a nice amount of spring back, and offers a separate number pad that’s nice to have. However, the entire keyboard is shifted upwards more than usual and the keys are perhaps a touch small, because the ASUS dial effectively increases the space between the touchpad and keyboard. I got used to it pretty quickly, though, and it was never bothersome.</p><p>Port-wise, it’s well-equipped with two fast USB-C 3.2 gen2 10Gbps connections, two USB-A 3.2 gen 2, HDMI 2.1, an audio jack and RJ45 ethernet. The HDMI 2.1 jack is nice, as it allows you to connect, say, a supported TV and get 4K at up to 120 fps. It’s good that one of the USB-C ports supports DisplayPort, because a lot of monitors only work with that standard. However, given that creators often connect tons of gadgets, I would have liked to see an extra USB-A port or two, though.</p><p>It’s nice that ASUS incorporated a bleeding edge SD Express card slot that can read data from supported cards at an awesome 985 MB/s. There’s a rather huge problem, though. If you insert an SD UHS II card used by tons of cameras, the StudioBook will only read it at UHS-I speeds — 100 MB/s instead of 300 MB/s. Since no cameras support SD Express yet, I’d rather have seen a standard UHS-II slot. (Hopefully that will change, as Sony, Nikon and Canon are part of the SD Express consortium.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04b549e0-4241-11ec-aa6b-cad7c4674536" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="c6801961-64ec-3d2a-90ee-30afa69d2f6f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>For sound, ASUS incorporated an audiophile-grade ESS Sabre DAC, promising lower distortion and expanded dynamic range. There are only a pair of speakers rather than four or more like on some recent laptops. However, they’re well above average for a laptop like this, with decent mid-range sound and acceptable bottom end. Other features include a fingerprint reader on the power button along with a top-mounted IR HD webcam with Windows Hello support and a privacy shutter.</p><p>Now, let’s talk about performance. The top-end ProArt StudioBook OLED 16 I’m testing uses the RTX 3070 mobile GPU, rather than the top-end RTX 3080. I don’t have a problem with that, as an RTX 3080 wouldn’t speed up creative apps much and adds cost and heat. Everything else is high-end, though. It’s got AMD’s top mobile 8-core Ryzen 5900HX chip, 32GB of RAM, and two terabytes of NVME storage in Raid 0. It currently comes with Windows 10 Pro, but ASUS will offer Windows 11 upgrades early next year.</p><p>I ran the ProArt StudioBook through our usual battery of performance tests, including PCMark 10 for productivity, 3DMark’s Time Spy for 3D performance, Atto’s diskbench and others.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td><td><p>ATTO (top reads/writes)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16 OLED H5600 (Ryzen 5900HX, NVIDIA RTX 3070)</p></td><td><p>6,954</p></td><td><p>4,604</p></td><td><p>1,499/9,053</p></td><td><p>5.61 GB/s / 5.35 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus G15 (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>6,881</p></td><td><p>4,530</p></td><td><p>1,426/7,267</p></td><td><p>3.3 GB/s / 2.85 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MSI GS66 Stealth (2021, Intel i7-10870H, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,369</p></td><td><p>4,538</p></td><td><p>1,247/6,505</p></td><td><p>3.1 GB/s / 2.9 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gigabyte Aero 17 HDR XB (Intel i7-10875H, NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,155</p></td><td><p>3,495</p></td><td><p>1,137/5,681</p></td><td><p>2.93 GB/s / 2.59 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus Duo 15 (Intel i9-10980HK, NVIDIA RTX 2080 Super Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,616</p></td><td><p>3,680</p></td><td><p>1,365/8,055</p></td><td><p>3 GB/s / 3.24 GB/s</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="" style="margin-bottom:10px;color:rgb(32, 43, 51);">It performed near the top in all of them, as shown in the chart above, particularly the disk speeds. With the RAID 0 NVMe storage, disk speeds are stupendously fast, with reads at 5.6 GB/s and writes at 5.35 GB/s. It can’t be overstated how much that helps disk-intensive apps like Premiere Pro.</p><p>I also ran tests more geared to content creation, like Maxon&#39;s Cinebench R23 and Puget Systems’ <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/">PugetBench</a> for Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Davinci Resolve. The PugetBench tests offer decent real-world results, as they automatically loop a series of functions that test effects, encoding, playback and so on. Again, I saw top-notch results compared to other recent creative and gaming laptops.</p><p>For instance, it hit 938 on the <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/PugetBench-for-DaVinci-Resolve-1523/">PugetBench DaVinci Resolve</a> extended overall test, a result that stacked up with many desktop machines. Other scores included a 981 on PugetBench Photoshop 22 CC, compared to 781 for the Dell XPS 15 OLED and 998 for Lenovo’s ThinkPad P15 Gen 2. Like most other laptops, though, it was handily bested by Apple’s M1 Max MacBook Pro, scoring 698 on the PugetBench Premiere Pro Standard test, compared to 821 for the MacBook.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04cacdb0-4241-11ec-8ffb-107313e4fd0d" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="89baf665-f6c8-31bd-91de-0e5c35e4e93c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Gaming is not this laptop’s <em>raison d’être</em>, but I did some anyway, and it acquitted itself beautifully with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em> and other titles. Frame rates were decent for 4K laptop gaming, though I needed to knock the detail settings well back. The 4K screen is a limiting factor, of course, because of the 60Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Synthetic benchmarks and gaming are fine, but creativity laptops need to prove themselves at work, too. To that end, I edited a camera review video for the laptop using DaVinci Resolve 17.2, and this video on the latest version of Premiere Pro. I also dipped into Photoshop, After Effects and Lightroom.</p><p>Again, the ProArt Studiobook acquitted itself with honors, offering fluid 4K editing, even with GPU-intensive camera codecs. I was able to export 4K videos at nearly 300 percent real-time speed in Resolve (NVIDIA encoder, MP4, 4K, 12,000 Kbps max data rate), with color correction, text and other light effects on nearly every shot.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04ff4b30-4241-11ec-b75e-21677d6a7cb2" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="d6948c7e-6955-3c6a-8500-ffd4cdcf8b3a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>For a desktop-replacement laptop that will often run off wall power, the StudioBook has surprisingly good battery life. It ran for 6 hours and 20 minutes in our 1080p video loop rundown test and even longer for normal browsing and work chores — excellent considering the 4K display. The AMD Ryzen 9 chip’s efficiency likely helps a lot here.</p><p>That beats most 4K PC laptops, with the exception of Dell’s XPS 15 OLED model that could go over 9 hours between charges. However, it gets stomped by the $2,500 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, which lasted a ridiculous 16 hours and 34 minutes in our tests. Yes, that model has slightly lower screen resolution, but it lasted over 2.5 times longer.</p><p>The StudioBook 16 OLED was relatively quiet during all these chores as well, with the fan only kicking in on complex scenes or exports. Even then, it was considerably quieter than my Gigabyte Aero 15X laptop. If you need maximum rendering performance and don’t need to stay in the room, you can select the “full-speed” setting that cranks the fans to the maximum speed.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04ff2421-4241-11ec-9fdd-b8427b984d60" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="7c4e1191-0346-3262-9f86-56f7aa3a5230"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>In the end, is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16" href="https://fave.co/3kuNUyZ">ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16</a> OLED laptop worth getting over rival creative models or a comparably equipped gaming laptop? Without a doubt.</p><p>It’s not just fast, but smooth and reliable across creative chores — and the “reliable” part is key for production-oriented laptops. It handles 4K editing and large photos without getting overly hot and noisy. It’s not even a bad gaming machine, though the 60Hz 4K screen isn’t ideal for that.</p><p>For the cost of the OLED model, you really get a lot. The model I’m working with will run around $3,000, though ASUS still hasn’t nailed down the final pricing yet. It also offers a better spec list than any rival creative laptops unless you’re willing to go way up in price. And don’t forget that the StudioBook has features not found on any laptop, creative or otherwise, like the 16-inch 4K OLED display and ProArt dial.</p><p>The MacBook Pro models with the M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs are making things more interesting for potential creative laptop buyers. They’re much more competitive than the Intel MacBook Pros, as they’re faster, quieter and have longer battery life. However, as Engadget has discovered in testing, the new MacBooks are better than PC laptops like the Studiobook 16 in some ways (battery and video playback) and worse in others (rendering, GPU performance in general). More on that soon in an upcoming Upscaled.</p><p>Still, for the money, the ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED is the best Windows 10 content creation laptop you can get right now. I haven’t been excited about too many laptops lately, but I can’t recommend this model enough.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-pro-art-studiobook-16-oled-review-the-best-windows-creator-laptop-150041474.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">56911ecd-f0dc-44b5-ac88-c5585a977947</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 15:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636643338</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T15:09:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/708a1340-4240-11ec-bdfb-225011f29bb8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/708a1340-4240-11ec-bdfb-225011f29bb8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rittenhouse defense incorrectly claims iPad pinch-to-zoom modifies footage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lack of technical knowledge may have just influenced an important court case. <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/kyle-rittenhouse-video-zoom.html">reports</a> the defense for shooter Kyle Rittenhouse incorrectly claimed that an iPad&#39;s pinch-to-zoom function could modify footage of the incident, &quot;creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there.&quot; That sparked a debate between lawyers and Judge Schroeder, who maintained the burden was on the prosecution to show the imagery remained in its &quot;virginal state,&quot; not on the defense to prove manipulation.</p><p>The judge may have accepted the argument. He denied the prosecution&#39;s request for an adjournment and instead called for a 15-minute recess, suggesting the team could find an expert to support their claim in that space of time. They didn&#39;t, and <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775580/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-judge-apple-ai-pinch-to-zoom-footage-manipulation-claim">noted</a> that the trial resumed with the jury watching video on a Windows PC connected to the courtroom TV.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you might imagine, the defense&#39;s claim played fast and loose with the truth. Pinch-to-zoom on all devices may use algorithms, but only to scale the image — it doesn&#39;t change the content itself. This was an attempt to prevent the jury from getting a clearer view of the action, not a genuine challenge to the integrity of the video.</p><p>The court scene underscored a recurring problem with technical inexperience in criminal cases. When judges and law enforcement don&#39;t understand how technology works, they may set unrealistic expectations or even skew the outcome of a case. Police have repeatedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-02-florida-police-obtain-alexa-recordings-in-murder-case.html">asked for Alexa recordings</a> on the unfounded assumption that smart speakers are always recording, for instance. While it&#39;s not clear if the inaccurate pinch-to-zoom claim will significantly affect Rittenhouse&#39;s fate, it certainly didn&#39;t help jurors.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kyle-rittenhouse-ipad-pinch-to-zoom-lawyers-claim-142110207.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">50d341a2-9a06-4f8f-ad6a-6d69f947bb5b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 14:21:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636650188</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T17:03:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d1edc6f0-42f3-11ec-99e7-b08ae4bd2106" width="7269" height="4089" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d1edc6f0-42f3-11ec-99e7-b08ae4bd2106" width="7269" height="4089" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[POOL New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[James Armstrong, a photographic expert in the Wisconsin State Crime Lab, testifies about drone video during the Kyle Rittenhouse trial in Kenosha (Wisconsin) Circuit Court in Kenosha, Wisconsin, U.S., November 9, 2021.

Google makes a few reliable ones, including the Nest Learning Thermostat, which is a tad bit smarter and sleeker than the standard model. Normally $249, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nest Learning Thermostat" href="https://fave.co/3F4t01q">Nest Learning Thermostat</a> is on sale for $179 at Wellbots right now when you use the code <strong>THERMOENGADGET</strong>.

In the case of Google&#39;s device, it uses a feature called Savings Finder to learn about your home system and make temperature suggestions and set schedules based on how you live. And since it syncs with Google&#39;s companion app, it can use your phone&#39;s location to know when you&#39;re away, automatically entering an Eco Temperature mode to save energy. The app also lets you set schedules manually and make adjustments from anywhere — so if you want your home at a certain temperature when you get home from work, you can set that before you even start your commute.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Nest Learning Thermostat has a few perks that the standard device doesn&#39;t have. First, it works with the Nest Temperature Sensors so you can control the environment in certain rooms of your home more easily.  It also has a metal ring deals and comes with a trim plate, so it&#39;ll look sleeker on your wall. The actual display on the device is nicer, too — it&#39;s a high-res panel that can show the time, temperature and the weather as well, depending on the settings you choose. Overall, it&#39;s a capable device that can make controlling the temperature of your home easier while saving you some money on energy costs in the long run.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-learning-thermostat-is-28-percent-off-right-now-132656197.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03e9ea6f-9963-4566-a949-6dfc57d077e5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 13:26:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636637218</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T13:27:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/45bbcb60-4243-11ec-8bbf-f64ddb1225a2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/45bbcb60-4243-11ec-8bbf-f64ddb1225a2" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Learning Thermostat]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Nest Learning Thermostat]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: PS5 and Xbox Series X and S, one year on]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S debuted one year ago this month.

The UK’s Supreme Court has ruled it cannot allow a US-style class action suit to be filed against the search giant after it deliberately created a workaround to track Safari users. The judgment focused on procedural matters, like the intersection between Google, based in the US, and the UK’s data protection laws.</p><p>The battle began in 2017 with consumer rights champion Richard Lloyd, and many others, forming a group called Google You Owe Us, which attempted to sue the company. It alleged that Google had illegally collected data on iPhone users between June 2011 and February 2012.</p><p>While the group lost at the High Court, the UK’s Court of Appeal overturned this initial decision, saying it was fair for Google to face a courtroom after the intentional misuse of personal data without consent.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-supreme-court-blocks-google-safari-privacy-lawsuit-104432598.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><p><strong>Sponsored by CISCO</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/smb-security-outcomes-study.html?ccid=cc001540&amp;oid=rptsc025200&amp;dtid=psolin000008">2021 Security Outcomes Study for Small Businesses</a></p><a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/smb-security-outcomes-study.html?ccid=cc001540&amp;oid=rptsc025200&amp;dtid=psolin000008"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/26261d50-22e5-11ec-a9dd-8d658ab0308c" style="height:370;width:640;" alt="CISCO Image 1 " data-uuid="9244ec91-dd0b-35e0-87c6-2c4e90b113ae"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></a><p></p></div><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-2-beta-nearby-airtag-scan-legacy-contacts-112524218.html https://www.engadget.com/...">iOS 15.2 beta introduces nearby AirTag searches</a></h2><h3>It may find unwanted trackers on your person.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-2-beta-nearby-airtag-scan-legacy-contacts-112524218.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/98cafc70-42e0-11ec-bbfd-cd793d174b81" style="height:438;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="809f3530-6a80-3b79-b5bb-78b8624b1e36"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure></a><p>Apple is introducing another way to ensure its AirTags won&#39;t be used for stalking when iOS 15.2 comes out.

The software update comes with no change in hardware as HTC &quot;secretly built in the 6E required hardware from Day 1,&quot; tweeted HTC&#39;s global head of hardware products, Shen Ye.&nbsp;</p><div id="91d9e490f9974263a7cd093e10afdcf5"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">You also don&#39;t need new hardware. We secretly built in the 6E required hardware from day 1 😬. They&#39;re going through certification right now and we&#39;ll begin eabling as soon as they get approved.</p>— Shen Ye (@shen) <a href="https://twitter.com/shen/status/1458717100428574731?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 11, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>WiFi 6E capability brings a &quot;wide range of benefits,&quot; according to Vive. That includes low latency and higher bandwidth for VR streaming with less WiFi interference. The wider frequency range also allows double the number of devices with their own dedicated channels. The headsets already had the hardware needed for the standard, &quot;so there&#39;s no added cost to the headset owner to leverage this functionality,&quot; the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vive also introduced a feature called Location Based Entertainment (LBE) mode, designed for businesses that use the Focus 3 headset. It increases the size of the play area from a 15m x 15m space (225 square meters or 2,422 square feet) to 33m x 33m (1,089 square meters or 11,722 square feet). That&#39;s the size of four tennis courts, compared to a size just under a tennis court, the company noted.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/af1a5040-42d4-11ec-af3f-4b2dfacdc80c" alt="Vive updates the Focus 3 headset with a much larger play area, WiFi 6e and more" data-uuid="53dde72d-f7b0-3978-a2a5-be4b986869d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HTC</div></figure><p>On top of the increased area, you can create a boundary in any custom shape like a polygon or L-shape. You&#39;ll only need to do that once, as the Focus 3 will &quot;constantly re-localize in the known play area.&quot; The new setting is designed to create large spaces for &quot;VR arcade, arena experiences or large training areas,&quot; according to HTC.&nbsp;</p><p>The update also includes Map Sharing, a feature that allows accurate co-location tracking among multiple users in a shared space. Other types of headsets that use outside-in tracking (rather than inside-out like the Focus 3), require &quot;users to carry a PCVR backpack and play in a limited space with the Lighthouse system,&quot; HTC notes. With the Focus 3, Map Sharing and LBE, &quot;users can finally run around in the field, provide cover for each other in shooting games or share their different perspectives in escape games,&quot; HTC said.</p><p>Other features include a Visual Odometery (VO) mode that lets you skip the usual 5-minute environment setup, an LBE Hybrid Mode that uses both VO and LBE for 6DoF tracking, and a Space Calibrator that allows accessories like a tennis racket to be more accurately tracked.

Now, the streaming giant has <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/bringing-av1-streaming-to-netflix-members-tvs-b7fc88e42320">enabled</a> AV1 streaming on the PS4 Pro and a limited number of smart TV models. Netflix was a key contributor to the development of AV1, which is available for use royalty free under the Alliance of Open Media. It shared this list of supported TVs with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775150/netflix-av1-codec-tv-streaming-ps4-pro"><em>The Verge</em></a>:</p><ul><li><p>Select Samsung 2020 UHD Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Select Samsung 2020 UHD QLED Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Select Samsung 2020 8K QLED Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Samsung The Frame 2020 Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Samsung The Serif 2020 Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Samsung The Terrace 2020 Smart TVs</p></li><li><p>Any TV connected to a PS4 Pro streaming with the Netflix app</p></li><li><p>Select Amazon Fire TV devices with Fire OS 7 and above</p></li><li><p>Select Android TV devices with Android OS 10 and above</p></li></ul><p>The company explained that deployment on TVs took sometime because playback on TV platforms depend on hardware. It was only over the past year that the industry released models capable of AV1 streaming. Netflix conducted comparison testing before rollout and found that AV1 delivers videos with better quality than other codecs, especially when there&#39;s network congestion. It also noticed fewer noticeable drops in quality due to changing network conditions and lesser time to start streams. In addition, since AV1 has higher compression efficiency than the codecs Netflix is currently using, it needs lesser bandwidth. That could lead to longer streaming sessions in 4K resolution.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A team within the company created a rollout strategy to minimize associated costs with encoding its whole catalogue. Netflix will consider a title&#39;s popularity into consideration and start with well-known shows like <em>La Casa de Papel (Money Heist) </em>to make sure the AV1 streaming reaches the most number of viewers. The streaming giant also said that it&#39;s working with more manufacturers to develop more devices with AV1 playback capability.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-av1-streaming-ps4-pro-select-tv-093538314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">587824c3-cc79-4279-b947-bebf4cfee986</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 09:35:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636620614</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T08:50:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Televisions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/87a4d8b0-e551-11e9-af83-d260a5f00ba0" width="4024" height="2665" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/87a4d8b0-e551-11e9-af83-d260a5f00ba0" width="4024" height="2665" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[amesy via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Southampton, England - July 31, 2017: Using a television remote control with dedicated Netflix button, TV in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TV Remote Control with Netflix Button]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony reportedly cuts PS5 production again as chip shortages and shipment issues bite]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony&#39;s PlayStation 5 may not be able to beat the PS4&#39;s first year sales record due to an ongoing component shortage, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/sony-trims-playstation-5-assembly-plans-after-chip-shortages-hit"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The company has reportedly cut its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-134-million-ps5s-084114658.html">previous production forecast</a> of 16 million down to 15 million, putting its target of 14.8 million PS5 sales by March in jeopardy, if the report is accurate. It also makes a bad situation worse in terms of consumers being able to pick up a PS5 over the holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony is supposedly having trouble with not just parts supply but shipping logistics as well, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s sources. The problems are due in part to uneven vaccine rollouts in nations where Sony builds chips, and shortages of essential parts like power chips.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The situation has affected other console makers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-lowers-its-switch-sales-forecast-due-to-global-chip-shortage-083924964.html">Nintendo</a> and even affected the launch of an entirely new console, Valve&#39;s Steam Deck — pushing the date back until some time in 2022. It&#39;s got to the point that publishers are reportedly saying that sales are gradually shifting over to PC versions of games due to a lack of consoles.</p><p>March is still a long ways off, so Sony might still be able to pull off the sales record goal. But it&#39;s rather ominous that this report is arriving just ahead of Christmas, so if you&#39;re looking for a PS5 as a gift and see an opportunity to get one, better snap it up quick.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-may-be-cutting-play-station-5-production-even-more-than-it-forecast-085009885.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16e39f5f-6d27-4c98-a2fc-5d0ea7798f2f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 08:50:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636620611</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T08:50:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f922b810-42c7-11ec-bdfb-50cbd12e7072" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f922b810-42c7-11ec-bdfb-50cbd12e7072" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony may be cutting PlayStation 5 production even more than it forecast]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony may be cutting PlayStation 5 production even more than it forecast]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter has stopped cropping image previews on the web, too]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After doing so on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-full-size-image-previews-now-available-ios-android-201809678.html">mobile</a>, Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1458538066461736965">stopped</a> automatically cropping images on the web, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775241/twitter-web-full-sized-images-no-crop-algorithm?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.

You&#39;ll have to sign in with your Walmart account before you can make a purchase, and we expect these to go quickly. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3qteMmW">Amazon</a> is also matching the deal, but is currently noting that Apple&#39;s AirPods will be back in stock soon.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3n4A0oT" id="3c5a836c9cd144b79762129026ebc2ca" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy AirPods (2nd gen) at Amazon - $89</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=retailevent2021&amp;subId3=BFEvent2&amp;sharedid=WMT21-BFEvent2&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441%3Fathbdg%3DL2000" id="b34d6c38d4904730875e030bccd2f200" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy AirPods (2nd gen) at Walmart - $89</a><p>If you&#39;re (somehow) unfamiliar, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-03-apple-airpods-review-2019-more-of-the-same.html">AirPods</a> are Apple&#39;s true wireless earbuds that have become some of the most popular buds in the space since the first came out. One of the biggest reasons why many prefer them is how easily they pair and switch with Apple devices. Setup is super quick as your iOS device will recognize the earbuds as soon as you open the case, and then audio playback will switch based on which device you&#39;re using. That means you can go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your MacBook without hassle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The second-gen AirPods have a similar design and fit to Apple&#39;s EarPods, and they have decent sound quality, too. We liked their improved wireless range and good battery life as well — you&#39;ll get around five hours of use before needing to recharge. Despite not being the newest AirPods anymore, these buds are a much better buy at this $89 sale price.

Disney+ added just 2.1 million subscribers in its <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disneys-fiscal-full-year-and-q4-2021-earnings-results-webcast/">fourth quarter</a>, giving it a total of 118.1 million customers. That&#39;s in line with the company&#39;s already cautious estimate (in the &quot;low single-digit millions&quot;) and 60 percent more total customers than a year earlier, but well below what some analysts expected. <em>CNBC</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/disney-dis-fiscal-q4-2021-earnings.html">noted</a> that StreetAccount predicted 9.4 million new users this quarter.</p><p>Disney&#39;s streaming-oriented Direct-to-Consumer division also lost $630 million (versus $374 million a year earlier) due in part to extra spending on production, marketing and &quot;technology costs.&quot; These were expected due to the growing service, but they suggest Disney+ isn&#39;t yet a net positive for Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-star-wars-mandalorian-disney-plus.html">two years after launch</a>. During an earnings call, company chief Bob Chapek was still confident the company would hit subscriber targets (over 230 million users by September 2024) and turn a profit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The media giant had warned of &quot;headwinds.&quot; While it didn&#39;t initially shed much light on the problems, we&#39;d note that Disney+ had a relatively quiet summer for shows, with series like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-nine-series-finale-120020465.html"><em>What If...?</em></a> and <em>Monsters at Work</em> shouldering the load. The company did stream two blockbuster movies, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html"><em>Black Widow</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-rock-jungle-cruise-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-170319455.html"><em>Jungle Cruise</em></a>, but original films weren&#39;t a strong point.</p><p>Things are looking brighter for the fall. Disney+ is streaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-imax-enhanced-marvel-mcu-140052678.html"><em>Shang-Chi</em></a> on November 12th, launching shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hawkeye-disney-plus-november-24-premiere-155812908.html"><em>Hawkeye</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-book-of-boba-fett-trailer-star-wars-disney-plus-the-mandalorian-151919443.html"><em>The Book of Boba Fett</em></a>, and expanding into countries like South Korea. All of those could boost subscribers and viewership. The issue is whether or not there&#39;s enough ongoing content and expansions to return Disney+ to form — particularly when the company is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html">returning to theater-first movie premieres</a>.</p><p>That wasn&#39;t the only long-term plan, either. Chapek teased the prospect of a Disney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a> that would involve the company&#39;s charcters and meld both the physical and virtual worlds. However, the CEO stressed that it was a long-term goal and didn&#39;t share timelines or other technical details. For now, this is more an attempt to counter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">Facebook&#39;s Meta rebranding</a> than a tangible project.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-q4-2021-earnings-subscribers-215350017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c64f6866-99a2-4f16-9885-ceaa571429d3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 21:53:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636581449</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T21:57:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13c1be80-2ce5-11ec-bebf-35b6ea41a2df" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13c1be80-2ce5-11ec-bebf-35b6ea41a2df" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/10/06: In this photo illustration a Disney+ (Disney Plus) logo is seen on a smartphone screen.
