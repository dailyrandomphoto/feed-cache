AMD has <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400">published</a> documentation on a couple of Windows 11 bugs affecting its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-5000g-cpu-153020975.html">Ryzen</a> processors, one of which can slow down its CPUs by up to 15 percent. That particular bug can increase L3 cache latency by three times, which in turn can affect apps that need quick access to memory.&nbsp;</p><p>Most affected applications could slow down by three to five percent. If you play games &quot;commonly used for eSports,&quot; though, you might be feeling the bug&#39;s impact a lot more, since it could slow down those games by around 10 to 15 percent. The second bug, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-bug-could-reduce-ryzen-cpu-performance-by-up-to-15-amd-says/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> explains, is related to the &quot;preferred core&quot; feature that allows a system to use the fastest individual CPU cores in a processor.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>AMD didn&#39;t mention any particular percentage for the second bug, but the company said its impact is more noticeable in chips with more than eight cores and with 65W Thermal Design Power (TDP) or higher. That includes many of the high-end desktop chips released over the past few years, but suggests popular lines like the 3600X and 5600X should be minimally affected, and AMD-powered laptops aren&#39;t likely to be particularly troubled either.&nbsp;</p><p>In its announcement, AMD assured that it&#39;s investigating the issues with Microsoft and that they&#39;re working on a fix for them. A patch for the first bug will be released as Windows update, while a fix for the second will roll out as a software update sometime this month. For the latter, it could mean having to check <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400">AMD&#39;s website</a> for the update and having to install new drivers manually.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amd-windows-11-bug-ryzen-100550246.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a7e8fd7-fb02-463d-8f57-f4e77ad02b98</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 10:05:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633689832</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T10:43:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c9bc6f80-2805-11ec-b3fc-57f59cbf6f98" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c9bc6f80-2805-11ec-b3fc-57f59cbf6f98" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[nantonov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Moscow, Russia - October, 2020: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Processor close up in the black motherboard CPU socket.

The main problem with it was the $599 price that&#39;s creeping up into iPad Pro territory. Now, you can pick up the 64GB and 256GB models at Amazon for the lowest prices we&#39;ve seen yet, $489 and $639 respectively — $110 off the regular prices.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3uQzltH" id="805119a485a14c68a960df8ac8617a59" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple iPad Air 64GB">Buy 64GB 2020 iPad Air at Amazon - $489</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3iFVwh2" id="bf9fc1db844c4700abf609521890fc8b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:256GB 2020 iPad Air">Buy 256GB 2020 iPad Air at Amazon - $639</a><p>In our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-2020-review-130044886.html">Engadget review</a>, we called the 2020 iPad Air &quot;the best tablet for almost everyone,&quot; and even the best high-end tablet. Apple transformed the design considerably with the flat edges used on the iPad Pro, while adding a 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display, USB-C charging port and a side button with TouchID technology.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the latest A14 Bionic chip, WiFi 6 technology and a16-core Neural Engine, it&#39;s delivers both strong performance and healthy battery life (10-12 hours). It also supports Apple&#39;s second-gen Pencil and accessories that essentially transform it into a laptop replacement, though those will obviously jot up the price.&nbsp;</p><p>The iPad Pro does offer some features not found on the iPad Air, like the M1 chipset and 120Hz screen that&#39;s slightly brighter (500 nits versus 600). If you&#39;ve been taking a look at the Air model, though, act soon because the sale is on for today only. As a reminder, Amazon has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-limited-time-sale-179-amazon-125010879.html">several other deals</a> on Apple products this week, particularly the Apple <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirPods" href="https://amzn.to/3mncUZ4">AirPods</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirPods Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3B5B948">AirPods Pro</a> wireless earbuds — the latter are discounted 28 percent to $179.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-2020-i-pad-air-drops-to-its-lowest-price-yet-092604870.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">96d378ee-169f-4776-a6d5-1996eeddbcc0</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 09:26:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633685240</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T09:27:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/44783120-2813-11ec-bcbc-b62a5faf913d" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/44783120-2813-11ec-bcbc-b62a5faf913d" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's 2020 iPad Air drops to its lowest price yet on Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple's 2020 iPad Air drops to its lowest price yet on Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple opens its Detroit Developer Academy to 100 students]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has opened its Developer Academy in Detroit, first announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-racial-equity-justice-propel-center-developer-academy-detroit-131109867.html">early this year</a> as part of its Racial Equity and Justice initiative. The project, done in collaboration with Michigan State University (MSU), has welcomed its first 100 students aged 18 to 60 for a 10-month &quot;comprehensive app development and entrepreneurial training&quot; program, Apple wrote in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-opens-developer-academy-in-detroit-to-create-new-career-opportunities/">newsroom post</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The custom-designed space is located in the First National Building in downtown Detroit.

Elon Musk has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/business/tesla-texas-headquarters.html">announced</a> the move at the company&#39;s most recent annual shareholder meeting, where he also clarified that Tesla still plans to expand production at its California plant by 50 percent. He explained, however, that there&#39;s &quot;a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area,&quot; because house prices are sky high, which means long commutes for workers who have to live elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>The move doesn&#39;t come entirely as a surprise: Musk previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-mask-requirement-nevada-battery-factory-210035322.html">threatened</a> to move Tesla&#39;s headquarters out of California after coronavirus <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-restarts-production-211807400.html">lockdowns</a> forced the company to suspend production in the state. He even called the lockdown orders &quot;fascist&quot; during an earnings call in 2020 and then personally relocated from LA to Austin a few months later. That said, it&#39;s worth noting that Tesla is now based in a state where it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-affected-by-texas-dealership-laws-152618312.html">can&#39;t sell</a> its cars to buyers directly, which has been its approach from the beginning, due to pro-dealership laws.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/tesla-moves-its-headquarters-from-california-to-texas.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> notes, Musk moving to Texas means he&#39;d be paying less taxes. The state has no personal income tax, whereas California has some of the largest income tax rates in the country. Further, the state has been offering companies tax breaks to build facilities in the state under the Texas Economic Development Act.</p><p>During the meeting, shareholders also voted on proposals to improve company governance. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/business/tesla-texas-headquarters.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> said they agreed on most of the proposals aside from a couple that the company opposed, one of which would require the company to publish reports on its efforts to diversify its workplace. Tesla said in a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2020-DEI-impact-report.pdf">report</a> (PDF) last year that its leadership in the US is still mostly white and male, while its workforce is 79 percent male and 34 percent white overall. Just a few days ago, the company was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-must-pay-ex-worker-137-million-in-discrimination-lawsuit-075729021.html">ordered</a> to pay $137 million in damages to a former Black worker.

Specifically, it’s capable of recording 6K video at up to 24 frames per second, 5.4K at 30 frames per second with a 3:2 crop and 5.9K at 30 frames per second with a 16:9 framing. Panasonic claims the BS1H’s sensor features more than 14 stops of dynamic range and the inclusion of both an optical low pass filter a Dual Native ISO feature help reduce moire and digital noise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But if you’re looking at a box-style camera for yourself, you want one for the added connectivity options the format promises. On the front, the BS1H is no slouch. Notably, it includes a USB 3.1 Type-C connection, an HDMI Type-A port and a 3G serial digital interface. It’s also possible to connect 12 BS1H cameras together to create a multi-camera setup. Additionally, you’ll find the usual assortment of 3.5mm and XLR microphone connections, on top of a LAN port. Oh, and it comes with dual SD card slots for worry-free redundancy.</p><p>Panasonic will sell the DC-BS1H for $3,500 when it becomes available in November.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-dc-bs1h-annoucement-222351349.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a913b3d4-22e3-431e-b12d-6dbccb5808a6</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 22:23:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633644426</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T22:07:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d0dfdb00-27b8-11ec-b76f-e12eb17b578a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d0dfdb00-27b8-11ec-b76f-e12eb17b578a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Panasonic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Panasonic DC-BS1H]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Panasonic DC-BS1H]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube blocks ads on climate change denial videos]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-anti-vaccine-video-ban-channel-takedowns-134545387.html">reduced tolerance for misinformation</a> now extends to climate science.

This won&#39;t stop science deniers from moving to other platforms or using their videos to peddle products like books, but it might discourage &#39;casual&#39; attempts to profit from climate misinformation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-bans-ads-on-climate-change-denial-videos-213242793.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fe55efed-aad2-45d5-927b-64384ffbe145</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 21:32:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633640990</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T21:10:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/895a1de0-27ae-11ec-9e7f-7808bb9bca88" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/895a1de0-27ae-11ec-9e7f-7808bb9bca88" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PAUL ELLIS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Climate activists hold a banner after climbing atop the roof of the entrance of the building and others line the pavement at ground level as they protest outside the UK office of Youtube during the tenth day of demonstrations by the climate change action group Extinction Rebellion, in London, on October 16, 2019. - Activists from the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion vowed Wednesday to challenge a blanket protest ban imposed by the London police.

To start, the company is <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en">testing</a> the option of adding multiple audio tracks to videos.

YouTube now permits live automatic captions for any livestream in English, not just those with 1,000 or more subscribers. These live captions will be available for all 13 supported auto-captioning languages in the &quot;coming months,&quot; according to the company.

Following cancellations in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-28-geneva-motor-show-canceled-over-coronavirus-fears.html">2020</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/geneva-motor-show-canceled-2021-215213497.html">2021</a>, the trade show was supposed to return on February 19th, 2022, but that’s no longer happening.

Pre-pandemic, it was one of the largest car shows in the world. It would usually attract more than 600,000 visitors, including some 10,000 journalists, to Swizterland.

The Square Enix-owned studio has <a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/news/eidos-montreal-and-eidos-sherbrooke-shifting-to-the-4-day-work-week/">announced</a> that its Quebec locations (Montreal and Sherbrooke) are shifting to a four-day, Monday-to-Thursday work week sometime in the &quot;next few weeks.&quot; Salaries and working conditions will remain the same, the <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Tomb Raider</em> developer said.</p><p>The hope, as you might expect, is to improve the quality of working hours. Eidos is accordingly encouraging teams to redefine work conditions and improve efficiency, such as by cutting meeting times. The company had already implemented some quality-of-life changes during the pandemic, such as rest periods and compensation for mental and physical health costs — this is ostensibly a logical extension of that strategy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Eidos isn&#39;t the first studio to adopt a four-day week. <em>Bugsnax</em> developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bugsnax-octodad-young-horses-ps5-indie-interview-201014684.html">Young Horses</a> made that switch in September. It&#39;s very rare for a large studio to make this move, though, and it might prompt similar moves by other developers if the strategy proves successful.</p><p>&quot;If&quot; is the operative term, however. Eidos was eager to tout past tests with shortened work weeks, like with Iceland&#39;s civil service, but it&#39;s not yet clear if that translates to the game industry. Developers are notorious for rushing games to make the holiday season, even if that leads to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-08-ubisoft-patch-4-will-fix-most-assassins-creed-unity-bugs.html">extremely buggy results</a>.  Eidos will have to make a hard choice: does it stick to the four-day schedule and risk delaying games, or demand extra hours to be sure a title is ready? This shortened week could pay off with happier developers, but it could also cause problems if teams take months more to finish projects.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eidos-montreal-sherbrooke-4-day-work-week-184509137.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">215385d2-3aa7-4d8a-9c84-13bf0d83f871</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 18:45:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633632313</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T18:45:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2018-12/a6967d50-f8cb-11e8-9edf-671f5eba7a4a" width="3882" height="2553" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-12/a6967d50-f8cb-11e8-9edf-671f5eba7a4a" width="3882" height="2553" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[FREDERIC J.

When YouTube returned with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-05-youtube-rewind-2019-video.html">Rewind 2019</a>, it abdicated editorial control and let the statistics guide the content to the frustration of viewers.

Writer and director Johannes Roberts (<em>47 Meters Down</em>) indicated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-movie-reboot-labor-day-weekend-181507669.html">earlier this year</a> that he was taking things back to the franchise&#39;s horror roots and the trailer offers some positive signs that he&#39;s achieved his goal.</p><div id="4835e48fc5dd45a397c2d100433b312f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4q6UGCyHZCI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The film is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-movie-reboot-labor-day-weekend-181507669.html">based on the first two games</a> in the classic series and it&#39;s a complete reset following the six (6) Paul W.S. Anderson movies. In case there was any ambiguity about Roberts starting over, the trailer&#39;s opening voiceover puts that firmly to bed. &quot;Every story has a beginning,&quot; one character, perhaps Claire Redfield, says. &quot;Discover the origin of evil.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</em> is set in 1998, and we see the first game&#39;s creepy mansion as well as some of the city where the sequel takes place. The trailer hits a lot of the right beats and it includes some memorable moments from the games. There&#39;s a nod to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Vn9grrIZ7E">opening scene of <em>Resident Evil 2</em></a>, in which an infected truck driver plows his tanker into Raccoon City. Despite a couple of iffy CGI shots, there&#39;s some solid creature design too, including zombie dogs and even a licker. Add in some jump scares, and it&#39;s a promising first look.</p><p>If you&#39;re craving more Resident Evil until the movie arrives, you can check out a virtual-reality version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-4-virtual-reality-remake-oculus-quest-release-date-170905892.html"><em>Resident Evil 4 </em>on Oculus Quest 2</a> later this month.

The company even got into the furniture game with what is possibly the <a href="https://output.com/products/platform">sexiest studio desk for under $1,000</a>. But its undeniable flagship is <a href="https://output.com/products/arcade">Arcade</a>, a subscription-based sample mangler that’s constantly serving up new sounds to mess with. Today the company is launching <a href="https://output.com/blog/arcade-note-kits-walkthrough">version 2.0</a> that includes a number of upgrades, but the biggest is the addition of “Note Kits” — which are simply playable chromatic instruments.</p><div id="85b0d70c8b6c40cb9d3a836e84b8c9f1"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/PsNiovo" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In the original version of Arcade you had what are now called Sampler Kits. Here you get 15 samples laid out across a keyboard on the white keys, while the black keys resequence, stretch, reverse or stutter the sounds. But Note Kits are just like any other soft synth, and the keyboard is just a keyboard so you can use Arcade to play melodies and chords more traditionally.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the main UI you’ll now find recommended Note Kits as well as Sampler Kits, and each line of sound packs is neatly divided into two, with sections for each. The main interface for the Note Kits isn’t much different than the Sampler Kits. There’s a keyboard at the bottom of the screen and four macro controls in the middle for modifying a sound and adding effects (though, they often use vague terms like space and breath).</p><p>The core conceit of Arcades — to be as approachable as possible — hasn’t changed either. Those four macros offer a good amount of control for shaping of your sound. But, if you really want to get detailed you can click the “tweak” button at the top. Here is where you’ll find the heart of Arcade’s synth engine. Similar to Kontakt Arcade is sample based. You can combine up to three different sounds then choose start, end and loop points. There are also separate amp, pitch and filter envelopes for each sample; a multimode filter with two different high- and low-pass options as well as drive; a modulation section with an ADSR envelope, an LFO and two 32-step sequencers; plus a number of built in effects like reverb, delay and chorus.</p><div id="b1bd249d08ea47cb83e20b33c8d2fc37"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/0hzAuT3" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Despite the fairly comprehensive set of sound design tools, Arcade is incredibly simple to use. While the interface pushes you to simply download a preset and start making music, it’s very easy to start creating unique instruments of your own. The one issue is that, while you can start from scratch to build your own note kit, it’s not prominently featured in the UI. And, as far as I can tell, there’s no way to import your own sounds to a Note Kit, only a Sampler.</p><p>The custom kit creator for samples has gotten a serious upgrade for version 2.0, though. The Kit Generator takes any sound from your own personal collection — whether you recorded it yourself or downloaded it from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splice-new-creator-plans-with-exclusive-plugins-and-educational-videos-123418413.html">Splice</a> — and then using AI spits out multiple variations, and pairs it with effects for further manipulation.</p><p>My one minor complaint is that you can&#39;t tweak the sample variations until after you&#39;ve saved the automatically generated kit as a preset. All you can do is select what predetermined set of effects macros you want to pair with it. And if you&#39;re not happy with the results, it doesn&#39;t appear you can delete custom kits. Only remove ones you&#39;ve downloaded from Output.</p><p>The app has gotten a mild facelift too, with better visual feedback and simplified navigation. Though, a single view for all the Kits you&#39;ve downloaded would be handy.</p><p>The combination of instant results and decently deep sound design tools makes Arcade incredibly fun to use. It doesn’t necessarily make sounds that other instruments or even your DAW’s stock plugins aren’t capable of. But it’s less tedious.</p><p>You can try Arcade 2.0 for free for 30 days, after which it’s $10 a month.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arcade-20-note-kits-instruments-sampler-hands-on-161548233.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cff0bbfe-84de-441d-9ec3-699bee7a9156</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 16:15:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633623827</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T16:24:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9c5e9d30-2786-11ec-9f57-a3573d555084" width="1968" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9c5e9d30-2786-11ec-9f57-a3573d555084" width="1968" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Output]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Output Arcade 2.0]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Output Arcade 2.0]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft made a translucent controller for the Xbox's 20th birthday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On November 15th, 2001, Microsoft released the original Xbox, in the process, it changed the console landscape forever.

A nifty touch here is that Microsoft made the internal components silver to make them easier to see. The brand’s signature green color is used for accent details, including the rear grips. Outside of those visual flourishes, it’s functionally the same as any other Xbox Wireless controller you can buy from Microsoft.

You can isolate or highlight elements like percussion and guitars, and there&#39;s even a simple loop generator with start and end points. You aren&#39;t about to produce a drum-and-bass mix of &quot;Before You Gotta Go,&quot; but you might get closer than you think.</p><p>This is a promo for the album, of course, and it&#39;s notable that you can&#39;t (officially) save your compositions. This might teach you a thing or two about layering in music, though. And it&#39;s free — you won&#39;t need more than your computer and some headphones to experiment with Barnett&#39;s tracks.

Many preterm babies require a NICU stay, with the average length being <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/pdfdocs/nicu_summary_final.pdf">13.5 days</a>. Though I had little idea of what I was doing when I brought home my twins from the NICU, I did know that I was going to continue to monitor their vitals stats using an Owlet sock. My partner and I had become accustomed to checking their heart rate and pulse ox levels on a hospital monitor, and being able to get that information at home helped us build confidence in our role as non-professional caretakers to two very tiny humans.</p><p>In both the NICU and online parenting forums, multiple people recommended the Owlet. It’s specifically these fans the brand was responding to with the recent release of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$359 Smart Sock Plus" href="https://fave.co/3s8iRLT">$359 Smart Sock Plus</a>, a larger sock with an updated algorithm that can be used on children up to five years old or 55 pounds. That’s a decent leap from the previous 18-month/30-pound cut-off that my kids just passed. The company claims that 72 percent of the parents it polled said they’d like to use their Smart Socks for longer, and that certainly included me.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><p>The third-generation Owlet monitoring system featured a redesigned “butterfly” style sensor that fit into an updated fabric sock, and it’s more of the same with the Plus. You’ll find the same removable sensor with a protruding button that attaches to the Base Station for wireless charging when not in use, along with the same winged, Velcro attachments for switching it between socks.</p><p>It’s also still lightweight, easy to remove and replace, and fast charging. Owlet says a full charge takes an hour and a half, and you can get eight hours worth of use with only 20 minutes of charging. That bore out in testing when I was able to grab a full night&#39;s worth of battery life in the time it took to finish our bedtime routine with the kids. The compact, more subtle Base Station is also the same as the one found on the smaller smart sock model.</p><p>The new sock has a similar construction, too, including a soft, flexible fabric strip that fastens around the ball of the foot to keep the sensor at the outside of the little toe. And there’s  an ankle band to secure the whole thing in place. The Smart Sock Plus comes with the same four initial sock sizes: left and right for under 12 pounds; and left and right for 12 to 30 pounds; plus an expansion pack of left and right socks for 30 to 55 pounds. It’s worth noting that currently the Smart Sock Plus is only available in the classic Mint Green shade, and not the Deep Sea Green or Dusty Rose colors.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d2840f0-26e5-11ec-bfda-eec8beb8a019" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus" data-uuid="1e774dc4-1cd5-3a0d-9aed-03c810c5f7bc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amber Bouman/Engadget</div></figure><p>I had issues with the fit on the last sock, and was pleased to find that the Plus version for larger kids (30-plus-pound) seemed less prone to unintentional slippage. I say unintentional because my kids have just learned to work Velcro so they can, very purposefully, take the sock off. While they were proud of themselves for their accomplishment, this underscores the challenge in offering a sock for older children: It might be a fight to get them to keep it on.</p><p>One of the user reviews I read for the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:original Owlet sock" href="https://fave.co/3nrMk0U">original Owlet sock</a> recommended putting a regular sock on over the smart one to keep it from sliding around. I tried that and found that it worked well for my son, but less so with my daughter who has better dexterity. That’s unlikely to solve the issue for the length of the sensor’s life, though I’d expect older children can be taught to wear the sock to sleep. I asked Owlet what they recommend to keep the sock in place in these instances, and they, too, suggest using a regular sock or footie pajamas. They also claim some parents wait until their kids are asleep to put the Smart Sock on, but those folks are braver than I.</p><p>Because the sock fits better, I had fewer disconnection error alerts. In fact, the only time I received alerts due to a misaligned sock were times when my kids had actually removed it. Given that frequent unexplained alerts were one of my pain points with the last version, it was nice to see that had improved. I got consistent readings when they were in fabric socks or footie pajamas, and also when they were under a blanket. What’s more, I had no problem keeping the Base Station in my office, next door to my kid’s room; it was still easily able to keep everything connected.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4cd18a0-26e5-11ec-bd7a-14ebc24f1380" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus worn underneath a fabric sock" data-uuid="48051c2e-33bc-3d6a-bc01-66dfdae06a41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amber Bouman/Engadget</div></figure><p>I will say that the sock still seemed to run out of battery quicker than the second-generation one did, but it was comparable to the third gen. While the sock could reliably make it through an  evening of monitoring (roughly 7pm to 7am), I occasionally saw low-battery warnings in the morning. However, these warnings indicated that I had less than four hours of runtime, which seems like plenty of time.</p><h2>Software</h2><p>Every time I set up an Owlet device, I hit a snag. This time, instead of connecting to the Owlet in my WiFi settings, I was instructed to go through the Privacy settings and toggle on the Local Network option. But the Owlet app kept telling me to check the permissions, even after I’d turned them on. And off. And on again. And closed and restarted the app.</p><p>Although this is the first time I had to call Owlet support for a resolution, I was able to easily get through to a live person and resolve the problem in a little over five minutes (thanks again, Jill!). I haven’t had any problems since.</p><p>As with the rest of the Plus experience, the app remains largely unchanged. The difference here are the updated algorithms that Owlet is using to calculate data for kids in the 18-month to five-year range. Because the sock can now fit more kids, the algorithm has to accommodate for physical changes over time. Owlet says a good example is heart rate, which changes as a child gets older.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8d630690-26eb-11ec-997e-18c73b9bd37e" alt="Owlet app" data-uuid="1139dd9f-b84b-342a-b97c-6075c0f65bd4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Owlet</div></figure><p>Aside from that, you still get a dashboard to access each child’s profile, which contains their live heart rate and pulse ox data, the battery life of the sock and WiFi connection status. If you’re also using the Owlet Cam as a video monitor, you’ll see the feed here. Previous days’ data can be found under History, which includes an overview and info graphs. This has always been one of the most useful portions of the app for me, as it showed me the trends on when my twins were — and were not — doing well sleeping.</p><p>As I mentioned, I haven’t yet had any false alerts, though I’m not sure what to chalk that up to — faster internet at my new house? A better fit on the sock? Upgraded algorithms? Either way, it’s nice to report on a better experience, especially given the price difference between the $359 Plus and the $299 third-gen sock.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>There aren’t a ton of products out there similar to Owlet’s sock. The company has seemingly cornered the market on baby wearables that measure pulse ox and heart rate, but there are a few other noteworthy devices in this space. One of them is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nanit system" href="https://amzn.to/3CVwm5O">Nanit system</a>, which pairs a camera with an item of the company’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Breathing Wear clothing" href="https://amzn.to/3F25X8v">Breathing Wear clothing</a> to monitor respiration and sleep as well as provide a video feed. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3ieFquT">Complete Monitoring System</a>, which includes app subscription extras like two days of video history, comes in at  $379. In testing, the Breathing Wear worked as advertised and the camera offered an impressively clear 1080p HD feed. I’ve also used the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Pampers Lumi" href="https://amzn.to/3kPgHPn">Pampers Lumi</a>, a solid $187 camera-slash-wearable that only tracks diaper changes and sleep patterns. However, it looks like the sensor is hard to come by right now — we&#39;ve reached out to Pampers to see if the Lumi sensor and companion diapers are still widely available.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e4b61890-26e8-11ec-bba7-7ffff1e21273" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus " data-uuid="b48176e5-aa57-3873-9e72-d217e16b5df3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Owlet</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Owlet Smart Sock Plus" href="https://fave.co/3s8iRLT">Owlet Smart Sock Plus</a> fills a need for people who are already on the Owlet bandwagon: It allows parents to continue using a product they like and are comfortable with for a longer period of time. Other than better algorithms and a larger sock, there’s not much difference between the Plus and the third-gen device — which was absolutely an improvement over the version that came before it. I’d expect the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$69 expansion pack" href="https://fave.co/3kOe1ld">$69 expansion pack</a> to sell well, as it provides what current customers will need to upgrade to the next sock level, but  $359 is a high barrier to entry for a baby monitoring system that may not work for your sleep routine. That said, if you’re an Owlet customer who is happy with your current smart sock, it’s unlikely you’ll regret snagging an expansion pack when your kiddo has gotten big enough.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/owlet-smart-sock-plus-review-130525360.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">806c6f42-64a7-4aae-808d-b302965efc16</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 13:05:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633608665</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T12:11:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f976d590-26ba-11ec-b1fc-ad705d650fee" width="8192" height="6719" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d93c9470-fab6-11eb-9efb-f01f4b675e7f" width="2000" height="1429" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Owlet / Weston Colton]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Owlet Smart Sock Plus]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Owlet Smart Sock Plus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’ is ready to let its ensign heroes rank up]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The following contains minor spoilers for season two, episode nine of ‘</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek: Lower Decks" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/a1Wk1R"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a><em>.’</em></p><p>Throughout the history of Star Trek, it’s generally accepted that a member of Starfleet will spend about three years as an <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ensign">ensign</a>, the lowest officer rank in the fleet. It’s the position given to new Starfleet Academy graduates, and the status of the four protagonists on <em>Lower Decks</em>. However, as the show wraps up its second season and prepares for a third, it does bring the character’s status as “lowly ensigns” into doubt. This week’s episode touches on, though doesn’t solve, the problem by exploring the universal concept of a “lower decker.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In “wej Duj” (the first full Klingon language episode title in the entire franchise), the <em>USS Cerritos</em> is in transit between missions, giving the crew some much-needed downtime. Mariner, Rutherford and Tendi use their day off to spend some personal time with senior officers, which sends the bridge-crew-friendless Boimler into a panic since he notes that this will give them an edge when it comes to getting promoted. He spends most of the episode trying and failing to get buddy-buddy with various officers. If this all feels like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-six-130040781.html">C-plot level shenanigans</a>, well, it is. But as a result the show takes its biggest leap yet to fill out its narrative in this episode.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fccecba0-26e5-11ec-af3f-142af226e5b9" data-uuid="c870b61f-e18d-308c-b2dd-d09724f9a5b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>“wej Duj” is Klingon for “three ships,” and we get to see the crew of the Klingon vessel <em>Che’Ta</em>, where a very ambitious Boimler-esque Klingon is trying to get in good with the current captain of his ship. Old school fans will remember that authority on Klingon ships is assigned by force, with an officer assuming command by killing the previous captain. This young Klingon isn’t quite that ambitious, but he’s perfectly happy to walk the captain’s pet targ if it helps him become first officer.</p><p>The episode also shows us the happenings on a nearby Vulcan craft called <em>Sh’Vhal</em>, where a lower decker named T’Lin there has been messing with the sensors and as a result, notices some strange readings in the area that she takes to the captain to investigate. The captain agrees to the search, but he also reprimands her for undertaking such unnecessary adjustments to the ship.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3ef8d070-26e6-11ec-b7d7-4006d6c0b2a0" data-uuid="83281cc2-9a0b-3a77-bc54-8b6b2b7b4b33"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>The entire episode could have been played as a “slice of life,” with the three plot lines never intersecting and it still would have been a fairly successful installment of the series. This isn’t our first look at the internal life of a Klingon ship, but it is our first look at a Vulcan crew, and playing those distinct societies against Starfleet culture is a great bit of world building. Star Trek has never been good about showing life outside Starfleet, only lightly touching on the grander world in more recent shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/picard"><em>Picard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20trek%3A%20prodigy"><em>Prodigy</em></a>. And even those still have tenuous Starfleet connections. <em>Lower Decks</em> has relished showing us the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-070123812.html">larger universe</a> that the characters exist in, and here we now get that same sense of expansion without the Starfleet worldview intruding.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the storylines stand apart, far from it. All three ships and their plot lines come together in the end, not only pulling the episode into one cohesive narrative, but also continuing — and starting to resolve — a plot line that has lingered since the end of season one, namely the Pakleds. We finally find out why they suddenly became a huge threat in the Alpha Quadrant, thanks to a series of machinations reminiscent of storylines on <em>The Next Generation</em> and <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. Not everything is revolved by the end, presumably leading into a big finale next week. It’s fair to say that seasons one and two basically comprise one full story arc, with season three possibly presenting a fresh slate.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2f76380-26e6-11ec-9fbf-c762142a472a" data-uuid="99aeaad1-776e-3fa9-bced-dcee5da97be3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>And it’s just in time, too. Each season has represented a year on the <em>Cerritos</em>. Next season will mark three years on the Cerritos for Boimler, Tendi and Rutherford, placing them in line for a promotion. And unlike Mariner’s purposeful self-sabotage, her friends have all shown themselves to be competent, trustworthy officers. There’s no reason they shouldn’t be promoted — and technically Brad Boimler already was at the end of last season, having only been demoted and sent back to the <em>Cerritos</em> because of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-two-kayshon-his-eyes-open-070038927.html">transporter accident on the USS Titan</a>.</p><p>While it’s unlikely (though not impossible) that the characters will get promoted in the season finale, it will have to happen some time next year for the show to maintain its verisimilitude in Star Trek canon. The <em>Cerritos</em> doesn’t have the luxury of being trapped in the Delta Quadrant as an excuse to keep its ensign an ensign (poor Harry Kim). But there’s hope, given what happens to our Klingon and Vulcan lower deckers by the end of “wej Duj.” Those outcomes, alongside the episode wrapping on Brad giving sage advice to a young crewman, seem to hint that the show is comfortable with letting our protagonists move on when it’s time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-nine-130037874.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d3f13522-630f-43aa-b90c-1787ccabfa00</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 13:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633563475</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T23:38:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f860a6a0-26e6-11ec-beff-55d35cafb35d" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f860a6a0-26e6-11ec-beff-55d35cafb35d" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["wej Duj" Ep# 209 -- Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner,  Noel Wells as Ensign Tendi, Eugene Cordero as Ensign Rutherford,  and Jack Quaid as Ensign Brad Boimler of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.
