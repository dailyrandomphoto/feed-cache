You&#39;ll get both email and iMessage notifications to the addresses and phone numbers associated with your Apple ID.

It instead asked users to visit the Apple ID website to verify warnings. Apple also pointed users to a Consumer Reports list of <a href="https://securityplanner.consumerreports.org/tool/emergency-resources">emergency resources</a> if you don&#39;t get the notification but are still reasonably confident you&#39;re under attack, whether from state actors or harassers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These kinds of notifications aren&#39;t new.

Samsung&#39;s original Galaxy Chromebook was one of them, but the company realized that paying $1,000 for a Chrome OS machine was a hard sell for most. Enter the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Galaxy Chromebook 2" href="https://amzn.to/3HTbRKg">Galaxy Chromebook 2</a>, Samsung&#39;s correction and a much better laptop with an easier-to-stomach starting price of $449. But now you can get the Galaxy Chromebook 2 for $50 less, or $399, which is a record low. That&#39;s for the base model with a Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Core i3 model" href="https://amzn.to/3FB0XXQ">Core i3 model</a> is also on sale for $549 — $50 more than it&#39;s lowest price, but still a decent deal.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HTbRKg" id="cb6635a09c8249f7a2d9a7fa13c0f8a8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Chromebook 2 at Amazon - $399</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3oLrnzb" id="6f88c187621a4fd08c2349b0997a70a6" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Chromebook 2 at Samsung - $399</a><p>Samsung prioritized the right things when developing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review-140021243.html">Galaxy Chromebook 2</a>. The design is much the same as the original, with a relatively light 2.2-pound frame, a premium build and a fiery red color. The company ditched the lovely yet taxing 4K display from the previous version and opted for a 1080p QLED touchscreen which remains nicer than panels on most other Chromebooks. While the 4K display did a number on the original laptop&#39;s battery life, this QLED display isn&#39;t as bad. We managed to get about 12 hours of use on a single charge, and while we wish the battery life was a tad longer, it should get you through a work day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Galaxy Chromebook 2 has a convertible design, too, so you can use it in tablet mode or prop it up so it acts as a small TV for video streaming. It doesn&#39;t come with a stylus like some of Samsung&#39;s other laptops, but any <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-01-google-universal-stylus-initiative.html">Universal Stylus Initiative</a> pen will work with it. If you&#39;re eyeing the Galaxy Chromebook 2 as a secondary or travel device, the base model with a Celeron processor may provide all the power you need. But hardcore Chrome OS fans who want to use this machine as their daily driver won&#39;t regret shelling out a bit more money for the Core i3 version.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Due to a technical issue with the campaign, the Elecjet Apollo Ultra was pulled from Indiegogo, but has returned today. The article text remains as originally published, but links to the campaign have changed.</em></p><p>In the space of a few years, we’ve gone from 5W USB adapters being the norm, to iPads and Nintendo Switches being able to charge at 18W, all the way up to modern laptops drawing up to 140W. This explosion in charging rates over a (somewhat) standardized USB-C connector has been great for consumers who can now mostly charge their stuff with one or two well-positioned adapters. But, it’s made choosing the right power bank to keep all of your devices topped up on the go way more difficult.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Enter Elecjet, a small company which has been carving out a niche for itself by using graphene in adapters and power banks. It launched its first “graphene-enhanced battery power bank,” on Indiegogo back in 2019, and is now back with the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/elecjet-world-s-fastest-charging-power-bank--2?secret_perk_token=426e4ca2&amp;utm_source=prm&amp;utm_medium=engadget&amp;utm_campaign=elecjet#">Elecjet Apollo Ultra</a>. It’s a 37Wh (10,000mAh) power bank with a couple of notable specs: It can be charged at 100W, and can output at up to 87W across its two ports.</p><p>These numbers are very high. On the output side, most 10,000mAh battery packs top out at around 18W; it’s only chunkier chargers that reach figures like 65W. On the input side of things, you’re looking at around 30W as the peak for a high-end portable charger. (There is a market for “laptop power stations,” which can meet and in some cases best Elecjet’s input and output numbers, but those are typically bulky units.)</p><p>My personal power bank at the moment is a 20,000mAh Anker PowerCore, which maxes out at around 25W output and 30W input. Although it’s double the capacity of the graphene model, after about a month of using a pre-production unit Elecjet sent me, I don’t want to go back.</p><div id="aaac938bf3f84bad835f9256cceb6ce6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MlJwM_hjwvk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Before I get into that, what does a “graphene-enhanced battery” even mean? Elecjet takes the lithium cells that are inside every device nowadays, and plays with the chemistry. Its “composite graphene cells,” mix a graphene solution in with the lithium in the cathode, and then add some layers of graphene coating the anode.</p><p>What you get from this sprinkling of graphene is much improved performance at the expense of size. Thanks to offering lower resistance and higher thermal conductivity, Elecjet’s graphene-lithium composite cells can theoretically be charged five times faster, and run through five times more charge cycles, but are about 25 percent less energy dense than regular lithium. So, composite graphene batteries are faster and run cooler, but will either have a lower capacity or a larger size when compared to the batteries we’re used to.</p><p>I’m not really close to pushing the Apollo Ultra to its stated 87W limit. The devices I need to charge on the regular are an iPhone 12, a Nintendo Switch and an M1 MacBook Air. It happily charges my Nintendo Switch at 18W, my iPhone at 20W, and my MacBook Air at around 45W.</p><p>That last figure is actually higher than the charger that came with the MacBook Air, but on plugging in a 65W Apple charger from a MacBook Pro, I saw essentially the same figure, so it appears that’s a safe rate for the battery. I did run some tests on a friend’s 13-inch MacBook Pro, though, and found it was able to charge it at a similar speed to the 65W charger that device came with, so I have no reason to doubt the output claims.</p><p>Speaking of claims, this is nitpicking to the extreme, but the Apollo Ultra’s USB-C port outputs at up to 65W, and its USB-A port can handle 18W. With the PPS power spec it can output at 68.25W, but none of these combinations add up to the claimed 87W output figure.</p><p>Output aside, the main benefit for me is how fast you can charge the battery itself. I’m quite forgetful, and will often be getting ready to leave the house with my phone on low battery, and then go to pick up my power bank only to find out it’s empty. I’m sure that’ll still happen, because if I haven’t learned in 36 years to prepare for life adequately I’m not about to change now.&nbsp;</p><p>But being able to charge the Apollo Ultra so quickly has meant it’s really not an issue. Plugging it in for about six to seven minutes gives me enough juice to charge my iPhone from the red up to 100 percent, and honestly even a couple of minutes before I run out of the door has got me home without my phone dying on me. Although the pre-production units are limited to 87W input (and so took about 35 minutes to charge), the final, 100W edition will charge from 0 to full in under half an hour. It’s like a safety net for my own stupidity.</p><p>Its small size, at least in comparison to my regular power bank, is also a plus. At 130 x 68mm, Elecjet’s bank has roughly the same footprint as an iPhone 13 mini, and it’s about 17mm thick. It’s totally pocketable for most folks, or at the least jacket-pocketable, which is not something I can say about my Anker. It’s also, in my opinion, pretty attractive for a power bank, with nice quality white and black plastics, and a proper display that shows the battery percentage. After years of divining how much power is left with four little LEDs, having so many degrees of precision is very nice.</p><p>For everything I love about its size and build quality, there’s no getting around the fact that the Apollo Ultra’s overall capacity is quite low. It can handle about two thirds of a MacBook Air’s charge, two and a bit Switch charges, or three-ish charges of a modern smartphone. That’s… absolutely fine. But the benefits of being able to charge something at 65W are somewhat limited when the battery drains in 35 minutes at that rate.</p><p>What I really want is impossible with today’s tech: Something this size, just as performant, but double the capacity. In the future, Elecjet says it will be able to make the power module smaller to mitigate the density issue, and it also claims it has “ a new battery under the wraps” that can get far closer to the density of regular cells.</p><p>In the meantime, it would be great to see Elecjet expand its current Apollo Ultra range to include larger capacity batteries. Some options would be good, so buyers can pick the compromise that suits them. A 55Wh battery pack would only be 50 percent larger, but handle a wider variety of devices. Even a 75Wh battery would only be double the volume.</p><section data-eng-breakout="99b534d608dc42458c4d82a174332a0b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/00f012f0-439e-11ec-9eef-2c5208c040e1" alt="Elecjet Apollo Ultra"></section><p>Judging the pricing Elecjet has opted for is difficult. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/elecjet-world-s-fastest-charging-power-bank--2?secret_perk_token=426e4ca2&amp;utm_source=prm&amp;utm_medium=engadget&amp;utm_campaign=elecjet#">The Apollo Ultra is on Indiegogo at $65</a>, which is honestly the most expensive I’ve seen a battery pack of this capacity in recent memory. But it behaves more like the ultra-high end battery packs that go for $100+, and unlike those it fits in my jeans pocket. But it doesn’t last as long as those— you see my problem. I think $65 is a reasonable price for what you get here. It’s a sleek, cool-looking thing, and the fast-charging makes it more useful to me than a “regular” larger-capacity battery pack.</p><p>As with all Indiegogo products, there’s a big caveat in that you are not buying a product that currently exists. Production will begin shortly, and users backing today should expect their devices in early 2022. I have a working unit on my desk, so I’m confident that Elecjet can deliver a power bank as advertised. But the company’s past Indiegogo campaigns do lead to even more caveats.</p><p>Both the Elecjet Apollo and Apollo Max campaigns had issues. A few users reported exploding power banks, others never received their units and, perhaps worst of all, users who complained through the Indiegogo campaigns were left without answers for months or in a couple of cases years. All of the complaints have now been addressed, but only in the past few days leading up to the launch of the new product.</p><p>Elecjet merged with another company named Real Graphene earlier this year. Both companies were founded by the same person, Samuel Gong, a UC Berkeley engineering graduate, but Gong says he was not involved in the day-to-day operations of Elecjet until the two merged.&nbsp;</p><p>When I asked about the complaints surrounding prior campaigns, Gong acknowledged that “there were some issues with the previous products’ quality,” and said most people who didn’t receive their product failed to provide a shipping address through Indiegogo. He said the company “was being managed by another team, and previous campaigns and products were done by [that] team.” He added that the new Apollo Ultra was extensively prototyped and has been evaluated by UL (a well-regarded certification company) for safety. The press pack Elecjet provided touts “8 safety features” and notes the device never exceeded 42C in testing. This matches my personal experience, in which the device was cooler to the touch than my regular power bank, which was charging at a lower rate.</p><p>As for not responding to customer support requests, he acknowledged that, after the merger, the company “couldn’t dedicate enough time to previous campaigns.” The reason he gave for the sudden responses to old complaints was that a new team has been hired to manage the Indiegogo campaign, and that team is also aiding backers of old projects from before the new leadership team was around.</p><p>I’m extremely into the Elecjet Apollo Ultra. It’s rare that I’m interested, let alone excited, about a product as dull as a power bank, but it’s always good to see something totally new enter any tech space. Those caveats are certainly worrying, though. If you’re not willing to take the risk but are still interested, Elecjet does have its own retail site, and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:a sizable Amazon presence" href="https://amzn.to/3C9YDor">a sizable Amazon presence</a>, for its other products. You could always wait for the product to launch and hit more traditional retail channels (at a slightly inflated price) further down the line.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/elecjet-apollo-ultra-power-bank-indiegogo-preview-120021315.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed5da528-4034-4f15-91af-ef720c1e6016</guid><dc:creator>Aaron Souppouris</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 13:45:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637761526</ingested><modified>2021-11-24T13:45:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Aaron Souppouris]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b4e53750-439d-11ec-bffd-d81c8e57966f" width="2560" height="1730" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b4e53750-439d-11ec-bffd-d81c8e57966f" width="2560" height="1730" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Elecjet Apollo Ultra]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Elecjet Apollo Ultra]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Beats Studio Buds fall to a new low of $100 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re looking for budget wireless noise-cancelling earbuds in the Apple family, don&#39;t forget about the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beats Studio Buds" href="https://amzn.to/3CN9MMn">Beats Studio Buds</a>.

Samsung gave it a new 3-in-1 biometric sensor to enable body mass scans using bioelectrical impedance analysis.

Another upgraded element that deserves a mention is its sharper screen.</p><p>The only big difference between the Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic is the latter&#39;s spinning bezel and stainless steel case.

According to the new agreement, however, Tesla will now be able to associate video to specific vehicles. &quot;By enabling FSD Beta, I consent to Tesla’s collection of VIN-associated image data from the vehicle’s external cameras and Cabin Camera in the occurrence of a serious safety risk or a safety event like a collision,&quot; the agreement reads.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>By enabling FSD Beta, I consent to Tesla’s collection of VIN-associated image data from the vehicle’s external cameras and Cabin Camera in the occurrence of a serious safety risk or a safety event like a collision.</p></blockquote><p>As <em>Electrek</em> notes, the language could indicate that Tesla wants to ensure it has evidence in case its FSD system is blamed for an accident. It could possibly also be used to detect and fix serious issues more quickly.</p><p>FSD 10.3 was released more widely than previous betas, but it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-pulls-latest-self-driving-beta-over-left-turn-and-other-issues-063331006.html">quickly pulled back</a> due to issues like unwarranted Forward Collision Warnings, unexpected autobraking and more.  At the time, CEO Elon Musk tweeted that such issues are &quot;to be expected with beta software,&quot; adding that &quot;it is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public tests.&quot;</p><p>However, other drivers on public roads are unwitting beta testers, too. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-investigation-192733573.html">currently investigating</a> a driver&#39;s complaint that FSD led to a November 3rd collision in Brea, California. The owner alleged that it caused his Model Y to enter the wrong lane and hit another car, causing considerable damage to both.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla is releasing the new beta to even more users with Driver Safety Scores of 98 and up — previously, beta releases were limited to drivers with perfect 100 scores. Tesla charges drivers $199 per month for the feature or $10,000 in one shot, but has failed meet promised deadlines for autonomous driving. Currently, the FSD system is considered to be a Level 2 system — far from the Level 4 required to really be &quot;full self-driving.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fsd-testers-must-consent-to-video-collection-in-case-of-a-crash-or-safety-issue-092112078.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b4acb0fb-3e3f-4c81-bb01-7e0acb7dec44</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 09:21:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637767822</ingested><modified>2021-11-24T15:30:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64b9ce00-4d00-11ec-bedf-8246fed3f253" width="2270" height="1329" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64b9ce00-4d00-11ec-bedf-8246fed3f253" width="2270" height="1329" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla FSD agree to video collection]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla FSD agree to video collection]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung will build a $17 billion semiconductor factory in Texas]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung has committed to build a chip-making factory in Texas, just as the US starts to push for the expansion in semiconductor production within the country.

According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-picks-texas-for-17-billion-chip-making-factory-11637710466?mod=rss_Technology"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, construction for the factory is scheduled to begin next year, while production within the facility is expected to start in the second half of 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>The US government has been taking steps towards <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-budget-proposal-domestic-chip-manufacturing-180310697.html">boosting</a> semiconductor production in the US, following the global chip shortage caused by shuttered plants and the high demand for PCs and other devices during the pandemic.

Instead, they&#39;re also available through the Kindle app. All that points to a future where Comixology may not exist sometime in the next few years.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/comixology-amazon-integration-2022-000312522.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">199afa95-a2fc-4974-b11b-671b9c5d3310</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 00:03:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637706627</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T22:30:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bec79700-4cac-11ec-be59-c717b8d777b3" width="700" height="400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/bec79700-4cac-11ec-be59-c717b8d777b3" width="700" height="400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Comixology]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Comixology]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile will pay $19.5 million settlement for 12-hour 911 outage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile is once again <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-17-t-mobile-to-pay-17-5-million-911-outage.html">on the hook for a 911 outage</a>. The carrier has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-reaches-195m-settlement-t-mobile-911-outage-investigation">agreed to pay</a> $19.5 million to settle an FCC investigation of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-outage-092021962.html">12-hour service outage</a> in June 2020 that led to 911 call failures. While the FCC didn&#39;t know exactly how many emergency calls were affected due to some overlapping issues, it recorded tens of thousands of issues.</p><p>Over 23,000 calls suffered a &quot;complete&quot; failure, the FCC said, while a similar amount didn&#39;t include location data. Roughly another 20,000 didn&#39;t include callback info. The outage began when a leased fiber link in the T-Mobile network went awry, and a single-location routing flaw magnified the crisis.

The FCC said the carrier responded to outage-related questions in a &quot;timely&quot; fashion, however, so this wasn&#39;t a hotly disputed issue. Not that the company was likely to fight a settlement that won&#39;t significantly impact its finances. And like it or not, this won&#39;t do much to help people who couldn&#39;t get full help in a moment of crisis.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-911-outage-fcc-settlement-230802122.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5d44e36d-89c5-4164-976b-dbe4a0306aeb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 23:08:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637706433</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T22:27:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6b11cbd0-1700-11ec-94fb-ebcea6d7e402" width="4234" height="2823" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6b11cbd0-1700-11ec-94fb-ebcea6d7e402" width="4234" height="2823" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ARLINGTON, VA - AUGUST 18:  People walk past the front of a T-Mobile retail store on August 18, 2021 in Arlington, Virginia.

The list includes familiar tech names like Apple, Google, Meta (Facebook), Telegram, TikTok and Twitter.</p><p>The law demands local offices for &quot;internet companies&quot; with over 500,000 daily users. Some of the companies already have offices, though, and it&#39;s unclear just what constitutes an official presence. Those deemed violating the law could be subject to either complete bans or limits on their ads, data gathering and money transfers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you might have guessed, the concern is that Russia might use the law to wield more control over those companies and their content. Russia has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-27-apple-caves-crimea-russia.html">clashed with Apple</a> multiple times, for instance, including a fine for allegedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-fines-apple-12-million-for-abusing-its-app-store-dominance-115545878.html">abusing App Store dominance</a> — this law might give officials more leverage. The move might also help Russia pressure companies into censoring content the government deems objectionable, such as social media posts backing the political opposition to Putin&#39;s regime.</p><p>The announcement makes a tricky situation that much more difficult. Russia is a significant market some companies can&#39;t always afford to lose but honoring the request could also mean enabling censorship and other rights abuses. Companies may soon have to make decisions that are painful regardless of the outcome.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/russia-tells-tech-companies-to-set-up-in-country-211922268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff961470-6b3a-474b-8159-ea4f88f17726</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 21:19:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637767851</ingested><modified>2021-11-24T15:31:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9de01b60-4c99-11ec-befe-f6afb12ce89d" width="5051" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9de01b60-4c99-11ec-befe-f6afb12ce89d" width="5051" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mikhail Metzel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOSCOW, RUSSIA - NOVEMBER 19, 2021: Russia's President Vladimir Putin holds a meeting with permanent members of the Russian Security Council via video link from the Moscow Kremlin.

The announcement comes less than a year after Reddit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-bought-tik-tok-rival-dubsmash-113916703.html">acquired</a> the TikTok-like video platform for an undisclosed sum in December 2020. Following the 22nd, Dubsmash won’t be available to download through the App Store or Google Play, nor will the app work after that date.</p><p>When Reddit first announced the acquisition, it said Dubsmash would retain its own platform and brand. “Combining forces has been a perfect match. Reddit is where passionate communities come together for timely, interactive and authentic exchanges about topics that matter to them, and video is increasingly core to how people want to connect,” the company said in a <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/bringing-more-of-dubsmash-to-reddit-by-launching-new-video-features">blog post</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of today’s announcement, Reddit is also rolling out new video features that come courtesy of the Dubsmash team. The built-in camera now includes options to change recording speeds and set a timer. Additionally, it’s now possible to upload clips in landscape, portrait mode and fill, as well as adjust and trim multiple clips at once. A new editing screen allows users to add stickers, doodles, voice-overs and filters to their clips.</p><p>The impending shutdown of Dubsmash is likely to affect creators of color most acutely.  Where TikTok’s best-known stars are white, Dubsmash was particularly popular among Black and Latinx users. At the end of 2020, Reddit noted 25 percent of all Black teens in the US were on the platform. Those users now face a tough decision: they either support a platform that has been seen as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-211856313.html">safe harbor for hate speech and misinformation</a> or look elsewhere to find a supportive community.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dubsmash-shutdown-february-22nd-202813243.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49afd050-9027-40b1-82c5-2858080111f0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 20:28:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637699296</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T20:28:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/dc678890-4c9a-11ec-bfeb-c7afcb3395d1" width="5261" height="3169" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/dc678890-4c9a-11ec-bfeb-c7afcb3395d1" width="5261" height="3169" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - DECEMBER 23: In this photo illustration, a mobile phone screen displays the logo of 'Dubsmash' in front of the 'Reddit" logo in Ankara, Turkey on December 23, 2020.

It was a neo-Western set in space; a noir thriller alongside the spectacle of martial arts action and John Woo-esque shootouts; an existential vision of a broken future where characters were forced to live with their shattered pasts. And on top of all of that, it was propelled by an iconic soundtrack that easily danced between genres. We didn&#39;t have much time in the Bebop-verse — just 26 episodes and a movie — so every second felt like a miracle. How could a live-action Netflix adaptation live up to that?</p><p>Simply put, it doesn&#39;t. While the original show was a love letter to cinema and pop culture, crafted by a creative dream team (director Shinichiro Watanabe, writer Keiko Nobumoto and composer Yoko Kanno), Netflix&#39;s remix is mainly in love with <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. It wants to remind us of the anime, so much so that it replicates many iconic sequences shot-for-shot, but it doesn&#39;t latch onto what made it so special. It hums the melody, but has no soul. It&#39;s a hollow tune that&#39;s common to nostalgia-focused reboots, like <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> and <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>, and it almost always holds them back.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="bbc63d9b46a247f7831ad67ea9f00dd5"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ULCIHP5dc44?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>By almost every measure, I should hate <em>Netflix&#39;s Cowboy Bebop</em> with a passion. But, it&#39;s a testament to the talented actors involved that I don&#39;t. John Cho wouldn&#39;t be my first choice to play the impossibly cool Spike Spiegel (that would be Sung Kang, <em>Fast and Furious&#39;s</em> swagger king Han), but he makes a serious effort to replicate his charm. Mustafa Shakir easily carries Jet Black&#39;s irascible yet lovable nature. And Daniella Pineda&#39;s Faye Valentine is an absolute scene stealer.</p><p>But this talented group is failed by a confounding production, which often looks worse than a cheap Doctor Who episode. Some sets appear to be made out of cardboard and spray paint, nothing conveys the lived-in aesthetic the anime captured so well. There are flashes of visual brilliance, to be clear, but that mainly comes from digital effects that often replicate shots from the original series. At times, <em>Bebop </em>wants to replicate the live-action cartoon aesthetic from the Wachowski&#39;s under-rated <em>Speed Racer</em>. Then, at other times, it will just have a bright neon &quot;PORN&quot; sign in the background, as if that&#39;s enough to convey the seediness of a neighborhood.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6f91c7c1-4c8c-11ec-8dee-95f2bbe8a747" alt="Cowboy Bebop Netflix" data-uuid="d69c2b7a-57a0-343d-a851-72debdb62923"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Geoffrey Short/Netflix</div></figure><p>So where did everything start going wrong? As with most nostalgia reboots, it usually comes down to the writing. Netflix&#39;s <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> was developed by Christopher Yost (<em>Thor: Ragnarok</em>, <em>Star Wars Rebels</em>) and includes genre talents like Javier Grillo-Marxuach (<em>Lost, Charmed)</em>. Their combined credits gave me hope that the show would be something more than a copycat of the anime, but instead it&#39;s a confusing mishmash of nostalgia worship and superfluous story additions.</p><p>Instead of being a mysterious cutthroat assassin, the villain Vicious comes across as a dull Eurotrash gangster. Instead of a haunting past based on the consequences of being overbearingly protective, Jet gets an estranged daughter and a ticked-off ex-wife. And perhaps most damningly, Spike&#39;s love interest Julia loses her mystique, and instead becomes another pretty damsel in distress. We&#39;ve seen all of these storylines before, so instead of feeling like &quot;a new genre unto itself,&quot; the bold proclamation the anime made in the middle of every episode, it all just feels like &quot;been there, done that.&quot;</p><section data-eng-breakout="82fc733a2f964a74aba24fdd9155a80d" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6f908f40-4c8c-11ec-b8fd-bb7ee494d85a" alt="Cowboy Bebop Netflix"></section><p>That&#39;s the same vibe I got while watching <em>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</em>. It starts out as an intriguing portrait of a struggling family, but eventually becomes bogged down by replicating almost every plot beat from the first <em>Ghostbusters</em>. It&#39;s still a fun and enjoyable film, but it&#39;s reverence for the past clearly prevented it from doing anything truly new. Watching that movie and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> over the weekend made me genuinely worried about the future of pop culture. Are we just doomed to repeat the past, over and over again, to appease the fans?</p><p>Now, here&#39;s the thing: Despite all of the ways <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> fundamentally misunderstands its source material, it still ends up being a decently enjoyable sci-fi romp. And if you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing, it&#39;s easy to overlook the flaws as you soak in the talent of the cast, the strange yet familiar future filled with terraformed moons and planets, and the catchy Yoko Kanno tunes.</p><p>My one faint hope is that viewers who enjoy the live-action series will also check out the anime, which is also available on Netflix. I&#39;m all for new viewers finding ways into existing properties. I just wish that didn&#39;t involve watering down classics to make them more palatable.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cowboy-bebop-review-netflix-191548307.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5109a5b7-478e-44ba-86d0-7f4a9fb57515</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 19:15:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637697875</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T20:04:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e31ac840-042f-11ec-bf5d-d4f050df77e4" width="3600" height="2348" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e31ac840-042f-11ec-bf5d-d4f050df77e4" width="3600" height="2348" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A still promoting the new live-action Netflix series 'Cowboy Bebop' showing three people and a corgi walking down a water-slicked back alley.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cowboy Bebop Netflix]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic Games buys Harmonix to create 'musical journeys' in 'Fortnite']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Epic Games has <a href="https://www.harmonixmusic.com/blog/harmonix-is-joining-the-epic-games-family"><ins>acquired Harmonix</ins></a>, the studio behind titles like <em>Guitar Hero</em>, <em>Rock Band</em>, <em>Dance Central</em> and more recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/harmonix-fuser-game-review-160025841.html"><em><ins>Fuser</ins></em></a>.

The move will maintain the &quot;continued safety&quot; of visitors while the museum finishes work on its first new west wing galleries.</p><p>The closure is part of the first phase of a seven-year renovation poised to cost over $1 billion. The Smithsonian is staggering closures to keep at least some physical museum spaces open during that period, including the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia (which will remain open). Some parts of the collection have relocated to other relevant museums in the meantime, such as the Museum of African American History and Culture, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of the American Indian.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The wait could be worthwhile. Eight west wing exhibits should launch when the main museum reopens, including &quot;One World Connected&quot; (shown above) and spaces touching on the Wright brothers, planetary exploration and the Moon.</p><p>Some parts of the renovation are still far from completion. The museum will start &quot;deinstallation&quot; of the east wing in March and won&#39;t complete its upgrade until sometime in 2025. If you can live with those limitations, though, the Air and Space Museum may soon be more relevant and engaging than in the past — even if you&#39;ve visited relatively recently.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/smithsonian-air-and-space-museum-closed-renovations-182003676.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f193ff1e-845a-416d-8b17-1a034c14269a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:20:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637698536</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T20:16:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture Organizations]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ec711990-4c81-11ec-8ffe-e43800f84d1d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ec711990-4c81-11ec-8ffe-e43800f84d1d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Smithsonian Air and Space Museum 'One Connected World' exhibit rendering]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Smithsonian Air and Space Museum 'One Connected World' exhibit rendering]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple sues NSO Group over state-backed spyware]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is more than a little angry at NSO Group for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-security-flaw-al-jazeera-journalist-spying-215710995.html">developing spyware tools</a>. The iPhone maker has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-sues-nso-group-to-curb-the-abuse-of-state-sponsored-spyware/">filed a lawsuit</a> against NSO to &quot;hold it accountable&quot; for governments spying on and targeting Apple device users. In addition to punishing NSO, Apple also seeks to ban the surveillance software developer from using Apple products for future research.</p><p>Senior VP Craig Federighi acknowledged that NSO Group&#39;s Pegasus spyware is only aimed at surveilling a small number of people on multiple platforms, including Android. However, Apple stressed that targets are frequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html">activists, journalists</a> and <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/11/palestinian-human-rights-defenders-hacked-nso-groups-pegasus-spyware/">other critics</a> of regimes that routinely suppress political dissent. The company further accused NSO of &quot;flagrant violations&quot; of federal- and state-level laws in the US.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The lawsuit also sheds more light on NSO&#39;s reported &quot;FORCEDENTRY&quot; exploit. According to Apple, intruders pushed FORCEDENTRY by creating bogus Apple IDs to send malicious code without alerting targets. Apple said its servers weren&#39;t compromised in the process, but it clearly wasn&#39;t happy that its account system was used for this surveillance.</p><p>Alongside the lawsuit, Apple is promising to donate $10 million (plus any lawsuit damages) toward groups advocating against or researching this kind of digital surveillance. It&#39;s further promising free engineering, intelligence and technical help for FORCEDENTRY discoverer Citizen Lab and other organizations with similar goals.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked NSO Group for comment. In the past, it has repeatedly maintained that it shuts off access to known abusers. It also denied that Pegasus was used to target murdered Saudi journalist <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-26-khashoggi-saudi-arabia-hacking-team-tech-blood-money.html">Jamal Khashoggi</a>. The Israeli firm has even gone on the offensive, hiring a libel attorney that accused investigators of &#39;misinterpreting&#39; data and otherwise smearing NSO&#39;s reputation.</p><p>NSO might not have many allies. WhatsApp, for instance, accused NSO of enabling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-nso-spyware-attack-215334253.html">attacks on government officials</a> and rejected the Pegasus creator&#39;s denials. The tech industry sees NSO as a threat to the privacy of its users (and thus its reputation), and it won&#39;t be surprising if other companies support Apple&#39;s case.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-nso-group-spyware-lawsuit-181306004.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">950ff9d1-8427-417b-9197-4b431aac5650</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:13:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637693125</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T18:45:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/01f465a0-4c88-11ec-97e7-908b932b2b4c" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/01f465a0-4c88-11ec-97e7-908b932b2b4c" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JOEL SAGET via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[This studio photographic illustration shows a smartphone with the website of Israel's NSO Group which features 'Pegasus' spyware, on display in Paris on July 21, 2021. - Private Israeli firm NSO Group has denied media reports its Pegasus software is linked to the mass surveillance of journalists and rights defenders, and insisted that all sales of its technology are approved by Israel's defence ministry (Photo by JOEL SAGET / AFP) (Photo by JOEL SAGET/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[FRANCE-ISRAEL-SECURITY-SPYWARE-PEGASUS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Android 12 review: Living in a Material (You) world]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="537dfb0d938e4bb4bd09c6e6da247695"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ke67k_7RgKo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Android is forked.

Features like HDR Net videos and white balance controls are also exclusive to Pixels, though that doesn’t mean they won’t one day <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-google-photos-gboard-other-android-devices-160039468.html">roll out more widely</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>Material You everywhere</strong></h2><p>Functionally, that means there isn’t much obviously different for those on other devices upgrading to Android 12. The biggest change will be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-material-you-android-personalized-redesign-182501466.html">new Material You design</a>, and how much of that makes its way to your particular handset will depend on your phone’s maker.</p><p>On <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/one-ui-4-update-delivers-an-elevated-mobile-experience-centered-around-you">One UI 4</a>, for example, you’ll get something similar to Material You by way of Samsung’s “whole host of new Color Palettes,” which like Google’s version will apply to menus, buttons and icons. But these aren’t automatically generated by the phone based on your wallpaper, and have a distinct Samsung-y cartoonish style that Galaxy users will find familiar. One UI 4 and Android 12 both also offer new widgets that look much better and offer more customization options than before.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1f25db00-4bd3-11ec-8dbe-c72fd622aab4" alt="Two screenshots showing the Android 12 Material You theme.

Sliders and buttons are larger than before, which some might find ugly compared to the cleaner, thinner options of Androids past.</p><p>After living with this new style for a few months, I’ve gotten used to the extra chonky navigational elements. In fact, in some apps, like Clock, the bigger targets are easier to see, and I can hit the Snooze slider more easily from bed. They even look pretty thanks to Material You, which beautifully infuses everything from the Settings shade to keyboards and numpads. I also like that the new lock screen clock takes over the whole display when you don’t have any notifications.</p><p>There’s plenty of little things that Google added throughout Android 12, like new animations across the interface and updated limits to toast dialogs. Those are the little boxes that pop up at the bottom of the screen when you copy text to your clipboard, for example. I’ll focus on just a few of the more obvious changes, starting with the quick settings panel and notification shade.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d47b6c0-4bd4-11ec-bef5-d54f97b5f96b" alt="Two screenshots showing the Android 12 Settings and Notifications shade. On the left is the quick settings panel with a couple of notifications, on the right is the expanded settings panel showing the display slider and eight toggles." data-uuid="c1044b03-4ccf-35aa-9e12-372924faad5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>In general, Google’s been busy decluttering. It removed the redundant “Conversations” and “Notifications” headers from the notifications list that took up extra lines, while using a background color in this area that’s close to the cards, making everything blend more smoothly. The Quick Settings area up top has a black background and just four buttons compared to the six from before, which means you’ll now need an extra swipe to access things like Battery Saver or Auto Rotate toggles. Of course, you can rearrange these to put your favorites first, but you’ll only be able to pick four.</p><p>This is a bummer, but at least when you make that extra swipe in Android 12, you’ll see eight settings shortcuts as opposed to just six. The net convenience lost or gained here is… kinda zero.</p><p>I also don’t love that Android 12 will default to summoning the Google Assistant when you long press the power button, but at least you can revert it to show the restart, shut down, lock and emergency buttons.</p><p>One of the most common ways I interact with my phone is by tapping the search bar at the bottom and typing either the name of an app I want or the show I’m about to watch. Nothing’s changed here since Android 11, you’ll still see your recent entries and suggested apps when you hit the text field. But if you use the search bar in the All Apps drawer, which requires a swipe up, you’ll get Android 12’s universal search. This will let you find things on your phone, including not just apps and contacts, but conversations within supported apps as well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e4c68c50-4bd4-11ec-bd99-0f73733b4ec0" alt="A pair of screenshots showing Android 12&#39;s universal search results. On the left are the results for the letter " data-uuid="1e813942-2d86-38cf-9dd2-c32b26309da3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I randomly hit “D,” and was shown a row of suggested apps, like Discord and Discovery+. Below that was a list of people from various apps, like my colleague Devindra on Gmail, as well as conversations with some guys named Dan and Dylan from Hinge. It also showed actions from specific apps, like “Submit a Front Desk instruction” in my building’s portal and “Connect with Mat Smith” on Duo. When I typed “the,” I got suggestions to order from “The Old Spot” on Uber Eats and quickly hail a ride to “The Westin Grand, Berlin” on Uber. Both are places I’d saved as favorites.</p><p>Finally, at the bottom, you’ll find an option to submit your query to Google’s search engine. Chances that I’ll scroll so far down the list are slim, but at least it gets shorter the more letters entered.</p><h2><strong>More privacy and battery information</strong></h2><p>Most of the changes in Android 12 I’ve described so far are in your face, and you’ll see them as you interact with the system. Others, like the new Privacy Dashboard, are things you’ll have to look for in Settings.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c5ff250-4bd5-11ec-bf3e-f4490fb44f99" alt="Two screenshots showing the Android 12 Battery and Privacy settings pages. " data-uuid="d2dceef2-a318-3214-b455-2ead6753aed6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That means they’ll be less impactful on your daily use, but they are, for the most part, informative. The Privacy Dashboard helped me realize that my camera and mic are activated a <em>ton</em> and showed the apps I most often use that require them. And speaking of, Android 12 also provides new indicators for when your mic and camera are being used (a green dot appears in the top right corner of the screen). This is basically the same as on iOS, except Google requires one more tap on the dot to see which app is accessing the sensor.</p><p>While the Battery Usage page isn’t new, it’s now more prominently featured as the first option in the Battery settings panel — you won’t have to tap a separate three-dot button to find it. Google did appear to update the graph showing your power levels for the last 24 hours, with the horizontal axis now poorly labeled with just the numbers 1, 7, 1, 7 and 1 (or 13, 19, 01, 07, 13 on the phone I set to military time) instead of “xx hr ago” and “xx min left”. I found myself ignoring this chart most of the time, since it isn’t all that helpful.</p><p>In the months I’ve been using Android 12, I’ve seen more apps ask for permission to access my specific or approximate location. I almost never selected the latter, but it’s nice to have the option for things like the weather app. In general, though, I relied on the “Allow this time” or “Allow while using” choices as a way to grant limited permissions to apps. Google will also tell you, after some time, which apps you haven’t used in awhile. It’ll automatically revoke permissions for those, which is nice. None of these apps were things I used often enough for this to be a problem.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3ce23e20-4bd5-11ec-9df5-a00615e610e7" alt="Three screenshots showing apps that make use of the Material You color scheme: Clock, Recorder and Calendar. " data-uuid="5ce629a3-f45f-3c20-9080-ce240e2dea95"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That’s… pretty much it for the major new Android 12 features. I’m still waiting to see an app that uses the new audio-coupled haptic feedback, since I enjoy the sensation it adds to games I’ve played on the iPhone 13 Pro. But there don’t appear to be any at the moment. Google is also constantly pushing out security and stability updates for Android 12, so maybe there are still more features to come.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>Ultimately, the biggest things Android 12 brings are Material You design and more privacy tools. That might seem minor on paper, but the visual refresh and faster animations throughout the system make it feel drastically different. Plus, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-updates-locked-folder-night-sight-videos-clipboard-android-safety-160012247.html">continues</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-update-june-2021-starred-messages-earthquake-detection-alert-voice-access-password-160100755.html">drop feature sets</a> every <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-scheduled-text-messages-maps-dark-mode-talkback-screen-reader-auto-password-checkup-170022939.html">quarter or so</a>, meaning each version of Android doesn’t have to be as major of an upgrade. But if you’ve been looking for a fresh face for your phone, Android 12 is a fun, satisfying update.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-review-material-you-privacy-controls-180010087.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2651d6f6-8c43-47be-89fb-620b26692bf4</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637687905</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T17:18:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A phone showing the Android 12 easter egg, which is the OS logo on a background of circles themed to the system's color scheme.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
