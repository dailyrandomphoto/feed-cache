Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fDI5wF">Jabra&#39;s Elite 85h</a> headphones are available for $150 on Amazon once again, giving you another chance to grab them at the price if you weren&#39;t able to last month. We praised the wireless headphones for offering active noise cancellation that rivals the technologies used by Bose and Sony and gave it a score of 84 in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-12-jabra-elite-85h-review.html">review</a>. The device was priced at $300 upon launch in 2019, which we felt was a bit too high for what it can do. Amazon has been selling it for $174 after its sale in July, but now it&#39;s back down to its lowest price on the website.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3fDI5wF">Buy Jabra Elite 85h Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones at Amazon - $150</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To be clear, only the Titanium Black version is on sale for $150 on Jabra&#39;s official store on Amazon, while the rest will cost you a bit more. If you don&#39;t mind the lack of color options, though, one of the best features we liked about the headphones is their insane battery life that can last up for to 41 hours with noise cancelation turned off. During our tests, we used the Elite 85h for around two to three hours a day for seven days and still had 85 percent of power left by the time we were done.&nbsp;</p><p>We also liked that it has EQ and noise-cancellation presets you can choose from based on your environment. You can have different settings for use in public and in private, and you don&#39;t even have to manually switch between them. The headphones have the ability to analyze noise, so they can detect your location and switch to the appropriate profile.</p><p>In addition, we praised the headphones for having simple controls and a better design than some of their rivals. We noted in our review that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh1000xm3-headphones-deal-114006907.html">Sony&#39;s 1000XM3</a> has better sound quality, but that device will set you back $100 more on Amazon right now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85h-anc-headphones-150-amazon-115755893.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1ee5d5ff-eace-4410-b008-63fb6b043f73</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 11:57:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628251119</ingested><modified>2021-08-06T11:58:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cfa373f0-f6a3-11eb-bde9-787f0a47085d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cfa373f0-f6a3-11eb-bde9-787f0a47085d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85h]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85h]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Disney’s immersive Star Wars experience is really expensive]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Disney&#39;s <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/star-wars-galactic-starcruiser/overview/"><ins>Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser</ins></a> is going to cost you.

With the release of iOS 15, watchOS 8 and macOS Monterey later this year, the company says it will introduce a variety of child safety features across Messages, Photos and Siri.</p><p>To start, the Messages app will include new notifications to warn children, as well as their parents, when they either send or receive sexually explicit photos. When someone sends a child an inappropriate image, the app will blur it and display several warnings. Apple will also introduce new software tools in iOS and iPadOS that will allow the company to detect when someone uploads content to iCloud that shows children involved in sexually explicit acts. Rather than scanning photos when they&#39;re uploaded to the cloud, the system will use an on-device database of &quot;known&quot; images. These features and more will come to devices later this year. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-ios-15-193820644.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-2030-ev-target-134025373.html">President Biden wants half of new vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2030</a></h2><p>Some carmakers and states want an even faster transition.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-2030-ev-target-134025373.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/697ae410-b809-11eb-bff8-50ef7f64c83f" style="height:3668;width:5500;" alt="U.S. President Joe Biden delivers remarks after touring Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan, U.S., May 18, 2021.

At the moment, there are two versions people can use: The OneNote app installed with Office and the OneNote for Windows 10 app available in the Microsoft Store. Microsoft will update the OneNote app with features currently exclusive to its counterpart pre-installed on Windows 10, though, and it will also give the program a visual refresh.</p><p>Microsoft originally intended to kill the OneNote app when the one for Windows 10 became available, but it changed its plans and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-08-microsoft-onenote-2016-revival.html">revived</a> the app in 2019. It upgraded the note-taking program with a bunch of new features and bundled it with Office installs a year later. Now, the tech giant says it will update OneNote with visual elements that it&#39;ll share with other Windows apps as part of Microsoft&#39;s efforts to give Windows 11 a more seamless look.

With the release of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">iOS 15</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html">watchOS 8</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html">macOS Monterey</a> later this year, the company says it will introduce a variety of child safety features across Messages, Photos and Siri.&nbsp;</p><p>To start, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-messages-ios-15-shared-with-you-173052730.html">Messages app</a> will include new notifications that will warn children, as well as their parents, when they either send or receive sexually explicit photos. When someone sends a child an inappropriate image, the app will blur it and display several warnings. &quot;It&#39;s not your fault, but sensitive photos and videos can be used to hurt you,&quot; says one of the notifications, per a screenshot Apple shared.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As an additional precaution, the company says Messages can also notify parents if their child decides to go ahead and view a sensitive image. &quot;Similar protections are available if a child attempts to send sexually explicit photos,&quot; according to Apple. The company notes the feature uses on-device machine learning to determine whether a photo is explicit. Moreover, Apple does not have access to the messages themselves. This feature will be available to family iCloud accounts.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple will also introduce new software tools in iOS and iPadOS that will allow the company to detect when someone uploads content to iCloud that shows children involved in sexually explicit acts. The company says it will use the technology to notify the <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/HOME">National Center for Missing and Exploited Children</a> (NCMEC), which will in turn work with law enforcement agencies across the US. &quot;Apple’s method of detecting known CSAM [Child Sexual Abuse Material] is designed with user privacy in mind,&quot; the company claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Rather than scanning photos when they&#39;re uploaded to the cloud, the system will use an on-device database of &quot;known&quot; images provided by NCMEC and other organizations. The company says that the database assigns a hash to the photos, which acts as a kind of digital fingerprint for them.</p><p>A cryptographic technology called private set intersection allows Apple to determine if there&#39;s a match without seeing the result of the process. In the event of a match, an iPhone or iPad will create a cryptographic safety voucher that will encrypt the upload, along with additional data about it.  Another technology called threshold secret sharing makes it so that the company can&#39;t see the contents of those vouchers unless someone passes an unspecified threshold of CSAM content. &quot;The threshold is set to provide an extremely high level of accuracy and ensures less than a one in one trillion chance per year of incorrectly flagging a given account,&quot; according to the company.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s only when that line is passed that the technology Apple plans to implement will allow the company to review the contents of the vouchers. At that point, the tech giant says it will manually review each report to confirm there&#39;s a match. In cases where there is one, it will disable the individual&#39;s iCloud account and forward a report to NEMEC. Users can appeal a suspension if they believe their account has been mistakenly flagged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c3429780-f62b-11eb-a3f3-7ed00c1cb0cb" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Siri Child Safety" data-uuid="4e706bda-0929-30f5-baf3-3f9956d659ce"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Lastly, Siri, as well as the built-in search feature found in iOS and macOS, will point users to child safety resources. For instance, you&#39;ll be able to ask the company&#39;s digital assistant how to report child exploitation. Apple also plans to update Siri to intervene when someone tries to conduct any CSAM-related searches. The assistant will explain &quot;that interest in this topic is harmful and problematic,&quot; as well as point the person to resources that offer help with the issue.</p><p>Apple&#39;s decision to effectively work with law enforcement agencies is likely to be seen as something of an about-face for the company. In 2016, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-18-fbi-apple-iphone-explainer.html">refused to help the FBI</a> unlock the iPhone that had belonged to the man behind the San Bernardino terror attack. Although the government eventually <a href="https://www.engadget.com/azimuth-apple-fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-unlock-141617737.html">turned</a> to an outside firm to access the device, Tim Cook called the episode &quot;chilling&quot; and warned it could create a backdoor for more government surveillance down the road.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-ios-15-193820644.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa253604-9ebc-4579-8249-e24e06de42a5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 19:39:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628197782</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T21:10:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b9df60b0-f621-11eb-af5f-70693fc0d782" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b9df60b0-f621-11eb-af5f-70693fc0d782" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Child Safety iOS15]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Child Safety iOS15]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox will host another indie games showcase on August 10th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft"><ins>Microsoft</ins></a> will host its second ID@Xbox indie game showcase of the year on Twitch next week.

And, when can I play again? Turns out, right now.</p><p>The <em>Back 4 Blood</em> open beta runs from August 5th to 9th, and again from August 12th to 16th, on PC, Xbox and PlayStation consoles. I got a sneak peek at what the beta has to offer on PC, with an emphasis on PvE content, since there were some technical issues with PvP modes during my playtime. Those have been resolved and I’m told PvP is ready to rock for the open beta.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not that you should expect it to be perfect. Turtle Rock Studios is using the open beta to fine-tune <em>Back 4 Blood</em> ahead of its release on October 12th, and developers are serious about gathering as much feedback as possible. There’s plenty to track: The game uses a <em>Left 4 Dead</em>-style AI director that adjusts the difficulty level in real-time as you plow through hordes of Ridden in your own special way. There’s also a card system that allows players to build decks of class-specific perks, plus corruption cards that apply randomized effects to every level, changing up the gameplay each time. And it’s a true cross-platform game, running across console generations and PC. All of this is on top of a new PvP mode and the core PvE gameplay, which has to feel like butter if it’s going to satisfy Turtle Rock’s <em>Left 4 Dead</em> fans.</p><p>I’m one of those fans, and I have to say, I’m enjoying the hell out of <em>Back 4 Blood</em>. <em>Left 4 Dead</em> is a pivotal game of my past, and <em>Back 4 Blood</em> taps into those good feelings in a delicious way.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab3c43c0-f559-11eb-ab7e-ac448a03b8fe" alt="Back 4 Blood" data-uuid="53d17609-be4b-31b0-904d-74bbfae41d6d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Turtle Rock Studios</div></figure><p>I’m most interested in PvE, since that’s the core of my nostalgia in this case, and I ended up playing about two hours of the main co-op mode with some new friends.<em>&nbsp;</em>The open beta features two PvE maps for co-op runs and two maps for the Swarm PvP mode, where teams of four take turns fighting each other as the Cleaners (the main characters) and the Ridden (the infected former humans). A new character, Mom, joins the roster of playable Cleaners for the first time, too.</p><p>One thing that stands out in <em>Back 4 Blood</em> is its sense of replayability. While the levels feel familiar, they’re filled with secrets and they naturally encourage dynamic play, offering various ways to approach any single encounter. The card system adds a lovely layer of customization to the game, while the corruption cards make each new round just a little different, just a little more exciting. There’s a variety of weapons and items to gather as well, and a healthy allotment of ammo drops throughout the maps, especially if you go exploring.&nbsp;</p><p>Shooting the Ridden is immensely satisfying with any gun, while getting snatched up or knocked down by a Special Ridden is shocking basically every time. Meanwhile, the dialogue among the Cleaners is cute, with references to “the new normal,” lizard people in the government and the lamestream media, to name a few joke opportunities. The protagonists of <em>Back 4 Blood </em>aren’t shocked and running for their lives; they’re on a mission to eradicate the Ridden and create safe zones for human life to resume. It’s a refreshing perspective twist.</p><p>I ran into a few issues during my time with <em>Back 4 Blood</em>’s open beta content, but nothing that felt insurmountable at this stage of development. Essentially, I trust Turtle Rock to take the feedback from the open beta and apply it to the game in the smartest, most gory way possible for its launch in October.</p><section data-eng-breakout="5c9241086b7542a581f9e638bbc764d3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab37afe0-f559-11eb-becf-3dde678801e8" alt="Back 4 Blood"></section><p>I actually chatted with Turtle Rock executive producer Matt O’Driscoll about the beta and what developers hope to get out of it.</p><p>&quot;These next two weeks are so vital to us,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re gonna get so much data for how people play this.

The question for most players in the open beta will be whether it’s<em> too much</em> like <em>Left 4 Dead </em>— but personally, I say bring it on, Turtle Rock. After all, it’s not like Valve is gonna give us <em>Left 4 Dead 3</em>. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-18-half-life-alyx-valve-steam-stockholders-boo.html">Or any <em>3</em></a>, for that matter.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/back-4-blood-turtle-rock-190023342.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">be018df8-d330-4df7-b1ce-a397e19b3872</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 19:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628180322</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T16:18:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab3c43c0-f559-11eb-ab7e-ac448a03b8fe" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/eb7d8b60-f559-11eb-977d-f25eb7e3eca8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Turtle Rock Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Back 4 Blood]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Back 4 Blood]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple reportedly plans to begin scanning iPhones in the US for child abuse images (updated)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is reportedly planning an update that would allow it to scan iPhones for images of child sexual abuse. According to the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/14440f81-d405-452f-97e2-a81458f5411f"><em><ins>Financial Times</ins></em></a>, the company has been briefing security researchers on the “neuralMatch” system, which would “continuously scan photos that are stored on a US user’s iPhone and have also been uploaded to its iCloud back-up system.”</p><p>The system would “proactively alert a team of human reviewers if it believes illegal imagery is detected” and human reviewers would alert law enforcement if the images were verified. The neuralMatch system, which was trained using a database from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, will be limited to iPhones in the United States to start, the report says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The move would be somewhat of an about face for Apple, which has previously stood up to law enforcement to defend users’ privacy. The company famously clashed with the FBI in 2016 after it refused to unlock an iPhone belonging to the man behind the San Bernardino terror attack. CEO Tim Cook said at the time that the government’s request <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-18-fbi-apple-iphone-explainer.html"><ins>was “chilling”</ins></a> and would have far-reaching consequences that could effectively create a backdoor for more government  surveillance. (The FBI ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/azimuth-apple-fbi-san-bernardino-iphone-unlock-141617737.html"><ins>turned</ins></a> to an outside security firm to unlock the phone.)</p><p>Now, security researchers are raising similar concerns. Though there’s broad support for increasing efforts to fight child abuse, researchers who spoke to the <em>FT </em>said that it could open the door for authoritarian regimes to spy on their citizens, since a system designed to detect one type of imagery could be expanded to other types of content, like terrorism or other content perceived as “anti-government.”</p><p>At the same time, Apple and other companies have faced mounting pressure to find ways to cooperate with law enforcement. As the report points out, social media platforms and cloud storage providers like iCloud already have systems to detect child sexual abuse imagery, but extending such efforts to images on a device would be a significant shift for the company.</p><p>Apple declined to comment to <em>FT,</em> but the company could release more details about its plans  “as soon as this week.”</p><p><strong>Update 8/5 4pm ET: </strong>Apple confirmed plans to <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">start testing</a> a system that would be able to detect images of child sexual abuse stored in iCloud Photos in the United States. &quot;Apple’s method of detecting known CSAM is designed with user privacy in mind. Instead of scanning images in the cloud, the system performs on-device matching using a database of known CSAM image hashes provided by NCMEC and other child safety organizations,&quot; the company wrote in a statement. &quot;Apple further transforms this database into an unreadable set of hashes that is securely stored on users’ devices.&quot;</p><p>The update will be rolling out at a later date, along with several other child safety features, including new parental controls that can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-ios-15-193820644.html">detect explicit photos</a> in children&#39;s Messages.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-scan-iphones-child-abuse-neuralmatch-185009882.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5deec0b-f18e-41e8-8c2e-fa433aa7ec36</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 18:50:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628193716</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T20:02:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/dfb7b890-5be5-11eb-bcff-939f1a4f7370" width="3500" height="2297" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/dfb7b890-5be5-11eb-bcff-939f1a4f7370" width="3500" height="2297" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Segar / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Apple logo hangs inside the glass entrance to the Apple Store on 5th Avenue in New York City, April 4, 2013.

This is about more than dirty jokes in the break room — the lawsuit highlights clear disparities in hiring, compensation and professional growth between men and women at Activision Blizzard, and it paints a picture of pervasive sexism and outright abuse in the workplace.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Here’s a rundown of some of the allegations:</p><ul><li><p>Just 20 percent of all Activision Blizzard employees are women.</p></li><li><p>Top leadership roles are filled solely by white men.</p></li><li><p>Across the company, women are paid less, promoted slower and fired faster than men.</p></li><li><p>HR and executives fail to take complaints of harassment seriously.</p></li><li><p>Women of color in particular are micromanaged and overlooked for promotions.</p></li><li><p>A pervasive frat-boy culture encourages behavior like “cube crawls,” where male employees grope and sexually harass female co-workers at their desks.</p></li></ul><p>It’s been a few weeks since the lawsuit was filed, and employees, executives and players have all had a chance to respond. Meanwhile, additional reports of longstanding harassment and sexism at Activision Blizzard have continued to roll out, including photos and stories of the “Cosby Suite,” which was specifically named in the filing. According to the lawsuit, this was a hotel room where male employees would gather to harass women at company events, named after the rapist Bill Cosby.&nbsp;</p><p>Days after the filing, <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"><em>Kotaku </em>published photos</a> of the supposed Cosby Suite, showing male Activision Blizzard developers posing on a bed with a framed photo of Bill Cosby at BlizzCon 2013. Screenshots of conversations among the developers discussed gathering “hot chixx for the Coz” and other insulting, immature things (especially when you remember these are middle-aged men, not middle-schoolers).</p><p>One of the only executives actually named in the suit was Blizzard head J. Allen Brack, and it alleges he routinely ignored systemic harassment and failed to punish abusers. Brack called the allegations “extremely troubling,” but this line was thrown back in his face on Twitter when independent developer <a href="https://twitter.com/Nelsormensch/status/1418618755437924357">Nels Anderson</a> compared it to <a href="https://youtu.be/Fi5dQzZp3f0?t=264">a video</a> out of BlizzCon 2010, featuring Brack on the far left.&nbsp;</p><div id="e6cdfb096d3841a6839a7823f4ad5e4c"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fi5dQzZp3f0?rel=0&amp;start=264" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In the video, a young woman asks the panel of <em>World of Warcraft</em> developers, all six of whom are white men, whether they&#39;ll ever create a female character that <em>doesn&#39;t </em>look like she just stepped out of a<em>&nbsp;</em>Victoria&#39;s Secret catalog. The panelists laugh and one responds, &quot;Which catalog would you like them to step out of?&quot; They proceed to essentially dismiss her question. At the end of the exchange, Brack piles on and makes a joke about one of the new characters coming from a sexy cow catalog.</p><p>On August 3rd, just two weeks after California filed its lawsuit, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html?src=rss">Brack stepped down</a> from his role as the president of Blizzard. In his place will be GM Mike Ybarra and executive development VP Jen Oneal. Oneal will be the first woman in a president role since Activision’s founding in 1979; the lawsuit notes that there has never been a non-white president or CEO of Activision Blizzard.</p><p>Activision Blizzard’s initial response to the lawsuit was <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/activision-blizzard-executives-cant-decide-whether-allegations-of-abuse-are-disturbing-or-meritless/">tragic</a>, with one leader calling the allegations meritless and distorted. Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick, who regularly gets into fights with shareholders over the ridiculous fortune he’s amassed, published <a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/letter-ceo-bobby-kotick-all-employees">his own response</a> to the lawsuit, where he essentially promised to listen better. Unsurprisingly, this didn’t alleviate many employees’ concerns. A petition in support of the lawsuit ended up gathering more than 2,000 employee signatures, and workers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-activision-blizzard-walkout-toxicity-123032466.html">organized a walk-out</a> just eight days after the filing, calling for systemic change at the studio.</p><div id="580ee883838541929e11d7aaef866f6b"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/gDdCyZz" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Shareholders weren&#39;t bolstered by Kotick&#39;s response, either. Investors filed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-investor-lawsuit-210106008.html">an additional class-action lawsuit</a> against Activision Blizzard on August 3rd, alleging the company failed to raise potential regulatory issues stemming from its discriminatory culture. Blizzard&#39;s head of HR, Jesse Meschuk, also left the company in the weeks following the initial lawsuit.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-07-29-ubisoft-staff-back-activision-blizzard-protestors-call-for-industry-wide-change">other</a> major <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-maker-weighs-in-on-activision-blizzard-allega-1847349156">game developers</a> have rallied behind the suit, and former Activision Blizzard leaders have <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-co-creator-chris-metzen-on-blizzard-lawsuit-we-1847361133">shared their support</a> for employees, <a href="https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1srp1ie">apologizing</a> for their parts in sustaining a toxic company culture.</p><div id="4981dff1c93c4fd09e7022e5442d8743"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is later than it should have been.

As evidenced by the photos, videos, stats and personal stories flowing out of Activision Blizzard, the company has operated on a bro-first basis for decades, and honestly, it’s been sustained by an industry that largely functions the same way.</p><p>In 2019, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-30-gamergate-sexual-abuse-twitter-developers-zoe-quinn.html">wave of accusations</a> against prominent male developers crashed over the industry, and AAA studios like Ubisoft and Riot Games made headlines for fostering toxic workplace environments. California is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-california-challenges-riot-games-discrimination-settlement.html">currently suing Riot</a> over allegations of sexual harassment and gender discrimination in hiring and pay practices.</p><p>But even that’s not new. Women, non-binary people and marginalized folks in the video game industry have been speaking up about systemic harassment and discrimination for literal decades. Sexism is apparent in the hiring and pay habits of many major studios, and it’s also clear in the games themselves, which feature an overabundance of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-17-gender-video-games-e3-feminist-frequency-numbers.html">straight, white, male protagonists</a>.</p><p>What <em>is </em>surprising, this time around, is that the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard kind of came out of nowhere. It took a blockbuster media report to make California sue Riot in 2020, but the lawsuit against Activision Blizzard appeared on its own, after years of quiet investigation by the Department of Fair Employment and Housing. If sexism is systemic in the video game industry, it feels like the system is finally fighting back.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7da88755-aa94-4059-818d-d5bae49cbff5</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 16:30:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628181712</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T16:42:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f0ef7ae0-f54f-11eb-bf39-1896212cf0e2" width="5000" height="3263" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f0ef7ae0-f54f-11eb-bf39-1896212cf0e2" width="5000" height="3263" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Employees of the video game company, Activision Blizzard, hold a walkout and protest rally to denounce the companys response to a California Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit and to call for changes in conditions for women and other marginalized groups, in , in Irvine, California, on July 28, 2021.  (Photo by DAVID MCNEW / AFP) (Photo by DAVID MCNEW/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-GAMES-SEXISM-ACTIVISION]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Paramount+ will launch in Europe in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.paramountplus.com/?cbsclick=156VUfX8XxyLWbxyAT2WyRb6UkBRUkynXS9TWc0&amp;vndid=2055067&amp;clickid=2055067&amp;sharedid=&amp;ftag=PPM-09-10aag1f&amp;dclid=CjkKEQjwmK6IBhCI4fOn_rvo3bIBEiQACJT-gqeO4ooyS2GQLhrzBMAZ3cTxTUxCG7UZjd54WV_o1Ynw_wcB">Paramount+</a> is finally expanding into Europe — with a little help. ViacomCBS has <a href="https://ir.viacomcbs.com/news-releases/news-release-details/viacomcbs-partners-sky-launch-paramount-europe">struck a deal</a> with Sky to launch Paramount+ in the UK, Austria, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Switzerland sometime in 2022. The pact will make the streaming TV service available on Sky platforms in return for Sky extending carriage of ViacomCBS pay TV channels like Comedy Central.</p><p>You&#39;ll have the option of both a direct subscription to Paramount+ as well as bundles.

Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have rights to carry <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-211633637.html"><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-picard-season-two-trailer-213316039.html"><em>Picard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-august-12-213816677.html"><em>Lower Decks</em></a> in the UK, for instance.</p><p>Paramount+ is already available in the Americas, Australia, Hungary, Russia and the Middle East. This could be the most significant expansion to date, though. Europe is a major market for streaming, and Sky&#39;s influence in the region could put the service in front of people who wouldn&#39;t otherwise have considered it. This won&#39;t bring Paramount+ to the level of heavyweights like Netflix or Prime Video,  but it could help competition against narrowly focused rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-expands-to-39-new-territories-082604619.html">HBO Max</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-europe-launch-145633779.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aac7f168-63ea-4255-9d03-d82b85c66663</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 14:56:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628177326</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T15:29:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34fd9a00-f5f5-11eb-aef7-e47775b1b342" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34fd9a00-f5f5-11eb-aef7-e47775b1b342" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/06/29: In this photo illustration, Paramount+ (Paramount Plus) logo is seen on a smartphone against its website in the background.

Google WiFi supports speeds of up to 1.2 Gbps, the company says. It claims a single point can support multiple simultaneous 4K video streams, though the size of your home, building materials and layout can impact signal strength.</p><p>The system uses WPA3 encryption and dual-band connectivity, as well as security updates and parental controls. You can manage the network using the Google Home app.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting Google WiFi isn&#39;t quite as fast as the Nest WiFi system. Each node can cover up to 1,500 square feet, compared with 2,200 square feet for the Nest WiFi router and 1,600 square feet for each additional point. The latter also has a built-in Google Assistant smart speaker. A Nest WiFi three-pack costs <a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/nest_wifi?hl=en-US">$350</a>, though. If you&#39;re in the market for a solid mesh system that won&#39;t break the bank, Google WiFi might do the trick.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-wifi-mesh-system-deal-amazon-143831298.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">538a75a7-e157-4dbf-9566-a6469b575750</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 14:38:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628174314</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T14:38:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c9536310-f5f5-11eb-bfb2-99dc60bb5966" width="708" height="491" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c9536310-f5f5-11eb-bfb2-99dc60bb5966" width="708" height="491" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google WiFi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google WiFi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[President Biden wants half of new vehicles to be zero-emissions by 2030]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>President Biden is throwing more of his weight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-ev-ford-biden-reveal-early-193001820.html">behind electric cars</a>.

Among the newcomers are Google’s first battery-powered Nest Cam and Doorbell, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-leak-nest-cameras-doorbell-035732377.html">as a recent leak indicated</a>. You’ll be able to install them just about anywhere around your home, and connect them to a wired power source, if you prefer.</p><p>The battery life depends on how many recorded events the devices detect and factors like the temperature and settings. Google says the Doorbell’s battery will run for up to six months on a single charge, while the Nest Cam can run for up to seven months before you need to juice it up. You can recharge the Doorbell over USB-C, and the camera using an included USB-A adaptor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/27fea8a0-f558-11eb-9ddd-6e79762844f3" alt="Battery-powered Google Nest Doorbell" data-uuid="59bbf247-1cd3-39e8-93c6-908b01c24e23"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The Doorbell captures video at a resolution of 989 x 1280 pixels at up to 30 frames per second. It has a 6x digital zoom, 145-degree diagonal field of view and can see up to 10 feet away in the dark thanks to its night vision capabilities. It also has a 3:4 field of view so you can get a full head-to-toe look at whoever shows up at your door.</p><p>As for the Nest Cam, it can capture video in 1080p at up to 30 fps. The device has a 130-degree diagonal field of view, 6x digital zoom and night vision that can see objects up to 20 feet away. It has an IP54 rating for weather resistance too. As well as mounting it outside, you can set up the camera indoors.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3df2edb0-f558-11eb-b9ff-8d889682a497" alt="Battery-powered Google Nest Cam" data-uuid="1fdbd755-b45f-3d4e-aae7-9dc80a48ba1a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Both products, which are designed with recycled materials, offer up to three hours of event video history. You can increase that with a Nest Aware subscription. Like some other Nest cameras, the battery-powered Nest Cam offers around-the-clock video recording with a Nest Aware Plus subscription, though you&#39;ll need to hook it up to a continuous power source.</p><p>In addition, the company is offering a Nest Cam with an integrated floodlight for the first time. One thing that all four devices have in common is that they&#39;re designed to only alert you to important events. They all have on-device machine learning capabilities to recognize and alert you to people, animals and vehicles. The Doorbell can detect and recognize packages placed as close as eight inches to your door. Google says don&#39;t need a subscription to use these features and that it trained the machine learning model on 40 million images to account for a variety of environments and lighting conditions.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/504cf500-f558-11eb-9fbe-81e0b5583eaa" alt="Google Nest Cam with floodlight" data-uuid="c85b35eb-49dc-3bab-8ef6-3de3c03031f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The devices also offer a familiar-face detection feature for Nest Aware subscribers. You can decide who they&#39;re able to recognize.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the on-device processing capabilities allow the Doorbell and cameras to store up to an hour of video events locally if the power or Wi-Fi go out. That&#39;s approximately a week&#39;s worth of events depending on activity levels around your home. When everything&#39;s up and running again, they&#39;ll upload those events to the cloud.&nbsp;</p><p>As you’d expect, the cameras and Doorbell are work with the Google Home app and other Google products, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nest">Nest</a> displays. Google also says Nest camera data is encrypted.</p><p>The battery-powered Nest Cam and Doorbell (which each cost $180) are available to pre-order today in 18 countries, including the US, Canada, UK, Australia and New Zealand. They&#39;ll be available in those countries on August 24th, in Japan two days later and in Mexico later this year. The Nest Cam with floodlight ($280) and second-gen wired Nest Cam ($100) are coming soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-doorbell-camera-battery-powered-floodlight-130016075.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b65b55c-fbc3-4fe8-aa21-a04533b33dab</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 13:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628140776</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T05:19:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0df09590-f558-11eb-bebf-96205eeb3be3" width="4943" height="3184" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0df09590-f558-11eb-bebf-96205eeb3be3" width="4943" height="3184" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Battery-powered Google Nest Cam and Doorbell]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Battery-powered Google Nest Cam and Doorbell]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Elon Musk confirms Walter Isaacson is writing his biography]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Walter Isaacson, the author behind the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-06-06-official-steve-jobs-biography-now-available-for-pre-order-on-ama.html">2011 Steve Jobs biography</a> published shortly after his death, is currently writing Elon Musk&#39;s life story. <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/walter-isaacson-in-preliminary-talks-with-elon-musk-to-write-biography"><em>Fox Business</em></a> reported back in June that the famous writer was in talks with Musk about the possibility of writing a book on him.

It was written by Ashlee Vance and was published in 2015.

It was also only later in 2015 that SpaceX first achieved the successful landing and recovery of a rocket&#39;s first stage.

In a statement, the Amazon says that it is launching two programs for businesses that use the retail giant’s infrastructure. These programs: FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon) Grade and Resell, as well as FBA Liquidations, will enable third party sellers to list returned stock on their product pages.</p><p>With the former, when a product is returned to Amazon, the company will evaluate its condition and then re-list it as as used product. Amazon added that sellers can set the price based on the grades Amazon hands out, and can control much of the process themselves. FBA Liquidations, meanwhile, lets sellers ship returned or overstocked product to wholesalers straight from Amazon’s logistics depots. They can connect with Amazon’s bulk resale partners and try to, in the words of the company&#39;s corporate parlance, “recover a portion of their inventory cost.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement comes shortly after the controversial report from <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2021-06-21/amazon-destroying-millions-of-items-of-unsold-stock-in-one-of-its-uk-warehouses-every-year-itv-news-investigation-finds"><em>ITV News</em></a>, which claimed that truckloads of brand new products were marked for destruction. One anonymous tipster told reporters at the time that the process did not spare even premium products like MacBook units and, despite what’s going on right now, sealed COVID face masks. As <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/566403-amazon-working-to-cut-waste-after-report-found-unsold-stock-was-destroyed"><em>The Hill</em></a> explained, the consequences of that report have raised hackles in the UK, with Labour MPs <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/559804-british-lawmakers-demand-meeting-with-amazon-after-video-shows-products">demanding</a> an explanation for the evidence presented. At the time, Amazon said that “no items are sent to landfill,” but as a last resort, some are sent to “energy recovery.”</p><p>Libby Johnson McKee, director of Amazon Returns, ReCommerce and Sustainability, said that the new initiatives are one example of how Amazon is trying to &quot;ensure that products sold on Amazon […] go to good use and don&#39;t become waste.” McKee added that the policies will help reduce costs and help companies who use Amazon&#39;s fulfillment platform will be able to grow their businesses. FBA Grade and Resell is available in the UK now, with other European nations coming online across next year. FBA Liquidations, meanwhile, is available in the US and other European nations, but is coming to the UK in August.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fba-grading-returns-wholesale-policy-changes-114014902.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c73fef0-131c-43aa-a391-de4bc5b6831d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 05 Aug 2021 11:40:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628162064</ingested><modified>2021-08-05T11:14:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3272cf40-f5db-11eb-aef8-9bef40a4fe11" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3272cf40-f5db-11eb-aef8-9bef40a4fe11" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Stirk via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LEEDS, ENGLAND - MAY 27: A general view outside an Amazon UK Services Ltd Warehouse at Leeds Distribution Park on May 27, 2021 in Leeds, England.
