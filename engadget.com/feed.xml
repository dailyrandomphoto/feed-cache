The company says that it discovered an “unauthorized third party” had gained access to its Managed WordPress hosting environment. Anything up to 1.2 million users have seen their email address and customer number exposed, as well as admin passwords for both WordPress sites hosted on the platform, as well as passwords for sFTPs, databases and SSL private keys.</p><p>The document says that GoDaddy believes that the breach first occurred on September 6th, 2021, and the investigation is currently ongoing. Demetrius Comes, Chief Information Security Officer, says that GoDaddy is currently working with law enforcement and a private IT forensics firm. In addition, it says that it has reset the relevant credentials and will work with users to issue new SSL certificates. Comes ends his statement by saying that the company will, perhaps a little too belatedly, “learn from this incident” and will take steps to prevent such a breach happening in future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is far from the first time that GoDaddy has been spoken in the same sentence as a security breach in recent years.

Innovators like Hexoskin and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-26-omsignal-smart-shirt.html">Omsignal</a>, not to mention huge companies like Adidas and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-18-ralph-lauren-polotech-review.html">Ralph Lauren</a>, have struggled to make an impact, demanding a lot of money for dedicated shirts and sensors, while contending with mediocre accuracy, polarizing style choices and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-10-the-future-of-wearables.html">not many compelling reasons to exist</a>. As Adam Crofts, founder of the startup <a href="https://www.prevayl.com/">Prevayl</a>, puts it, there have been a lot of lessons to learn from other companies’ mistakes. He’s hoping to get it right.</p><p>Prevayl, whose first products launch in the UK later this month, combines a small tracking sensor with a line of fitness “smart” shirts, from crop tops through to vests and compression shirts, in addition to a companion app (of course) and an online community. Usually, that means something approximating a forum, but according to the company’s website, it’s created “a members-only private community designed for amateur athletes and the sporting elite.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s limited its first wave of users to 700 people. The audience seems to be, well, the fittest friends and acquaintances you know. The ones that know what they can benchpress, their fastest 5K time, or their VO2 Max. The latter is not a haircare product.</p><p>Prevayl’s sweet spot is this area between amateur athlete and biometric obsessive, and it’s approaching the fitness tech fight with style. It has a slick promotional video featuring pro athletes, a moody black logo and a surprisingly slick, well designed app. (Seriously, it amazes me how poor most entry-level fitness apps can still look.) And the shirt? Well, it looks good on the athletes.</p><section data-eng-breakout="cc9a4f938a3c466b99af230cbbc163b6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655500-4b9d-11ec-bfe7-63c0c79b9f14" alt="Prevayl smart shirt"></section><p>At a preview event in London, the team set me up in one of their first shirts, ahead of a planned launch early next year. It feels like a premium, luxury sports tee. It’s breathable, soft to the touch and <em>tight</em>. An elasticated band across the chest on all of the garments houses the conductive sensors, connected with graphene-augmented knitted electrodes. The fibers connecting these sensors look like metallic shoelaces and are machine washable. The shirt can go straight into a warm laundry wash; you just need to ensure you’ve taken the sensor out from the tiny pocket on the front of the clothing.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655500-4b9d-11ec-bbed-2e49a491e595" alt="Prevayl smart shirt" data-uuid="8af94e6e-a70c-362a-93ca-cd30ff20ff81"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s no need to fasten the sensor in place, as it comes in contact with the conductive fabric as soon as it’s in the front of the shirt. The sensor itself is an evolution from the chunky haphazard sensor unit design of smartwear’s past. The sensor has a plastic stopper that protects the USB-C charging port, while the charging cable is a small, machined aluminum clasp that magnetically folds in on itself.</p><p>The company makes everything here in-house, and Crofts believes this is why Prevayl can do things differently. “Usually, it’s been tech [companies] trying to make clothing or visa versa.” The company’s approach to the clothing itself was “style led” design. Prevayl’s head office has entire machines and technicians dedicated to knitting the clothing part of the equation.</p><p>Despite the sensor itself being so small, it’s packed with tech. There’s a “clinical-grade” ECG, that tracks your workout with four times the frequency of Polar heart rate monitors. It also monitors breathing frequency, motion and even body temperature. There’s even a bioimpedance sensor, which can be used for body composition scans, but there didn’t seem to be any feature that takes advantage of that yet. Prevayl is trying to do it all.</p><p>The company puts all this biometric data to use through many of the features and guidance you’ve seen on other fitness devices and services. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pga-tour-whoop-wearable-player-biometrics-100048054.html">Whoop</a>, the system can be used to gauge whether your body has <a href="https://www.whoop.com/experience/">fully recovered</a> from a workout; like MyZone’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/myzone-mz-switch-heart-rate-monitor-130550081.html">traffic light system</a>, it color-codes your workout effort into five categories, measuring both how hard you’re working out and when your heart rate has recovered. This is all in addition to tracking your heart-rate, caloric burn and more. Within the app, you can even see an accurate cardiogram of your heart as it beats away.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655501-4b9d-11ec-be97-e63e3dbfd165" alt="Prevayl smart shirt" data-uuid="d641e81e-33d2-3f93-bf79-37a930e340e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the bigger challenges, which many fitness trackers and wearables struggle with, is ensuring a decent level of accuracy. Crofts mentioned multiple times during our interview that the company has been obsessed with gathering data.</p><p>The company worked with the UK’s University of Salford to validate the accuracy of its ECG unit. The team also recruited professional athletes, including British Olympic and Paralympic athletes and professional sportspeople, to test its prototypes and offer up crucial data for the team to chew over. The next stage is testing with more typical gym-goers, weekend warriors and the marginal gain-chaser, kicking off this month.</p><p>Even sized at a large, my tee felt a little too snug. I know many of us aren’t fans of the compression fit, but this, a tank top and crop top are the only options for now. Fortunately, Prevayl is working on loose fit and long-sleeved options, which I’d find more appealing. More colors, beyond Personal Trainer Black (my name, not theirs), are also incoming. The issue remains, though: If you wanted to use this system frequently, you will need more than one top. Or to do a daily laundry run.</p><p>As the sensor is removable, this should strip away some (most?) of the cost of additional shirts. But Prevayl wants to invade the luxury sportswear segment and that means prices to reflect that ambition. To begin with, it will cost you at least £120, which is roughly equivalent to $160. <a href="https://shop.prevayl.com/product">This starter kit </a>includes a sensor priced at £60, and a tank top. Not including the sensor, the Smart Tank will cost £60, while the Smarts Sports Bra will be £65. The Smart T-Shirt, which I tested, will cost £70. The impressive specs and tight app integration will go up against the expensive cost of entry.</p><p>Judging from my demo with Prevayl’s team (and my own early testing), the product is already looking polished. I spoke with a fitness professional at my local gym who, conveniently, had also tested out Prevayl. She noted that any new smartwear product would have to fight against incumbent chest straps and fitness trackers. Unlike a smartwatch, it’s nearly impossible to wear this top in tandem with a chest strap from another manufacturer. People are creators of habit — especially when it comes to exercise. People swear by Strada or their Apple Watch because it’s familiar and consistent. At this early stage, Prevayl’s online community isn’t yet live.</p><p>For now, the company is focusing on the UK and Ireland, but Prevayl’s spokesperson told me that the US will be a priority. I’m planning to test the smart shirt further, but I might have to invest in more items if I want to get serious about using Prevayl regularly.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/prevayl-smartwear-smart-shirt-fitness-workout-150040128.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">87403336-9186-48ac-a64c-14b6a32444ff</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 15:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637592592</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T14:50:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655501-4b9d-11ec-bfcd-6f4af0a6953e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69655501-4b9d-11ec-bfcd-6f4af0a6953e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Prevayl smart shirt]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Prevayl smart shirt]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crucial's 1TB MX500 internal SSD is back on sale for $85]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s frustrating to run out of space on your desktop or laptop, but you can turn to storage devices for extra room and now&#39;s a good time to look for them if you&#39;re getting short on space. Black Friday deals have already popped up on some of our favorite models, including those from Crucial. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:1TB MX500 internal SSD" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba">1TB MX500 internal SSD</a> is on sale for $85, which is 15 percent off its normal price and only a few dollars shy of a record low. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2TB" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba">2TB</a> model is down to $168 as well, and if you don&#39;t need that much extra space, you can pick up the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:500GB" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba">500GB</a> version for only $53.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DFV4ba" id="9c3ab95ef2c14a3a9e6ef59a06ff5d23" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Crucial MX500 (1TB) at Amazon - $85</a><p>The MX500 should fit into most computers thanks to its 2.5-inch design, and it supports sequential read speeds of up to 560 MB/s and sequential write speeds of up to 510 MB/s. It also comes with AES 256-bit hardware encryption as well as integrated power-loss immunity, the latter of which should protect your data even if your power gets cut unexpectedly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;re looking for an internal drive that&#39;s a bit more high-end, or one that works with the PS5, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Crucial&#39;s P5 Plus" href="https://amzn.to/3oONoNC">Crucial&#39;s P5 Plus</a> in 1TB is down to $145, which is 19 percent off its regular rate and an all-time low. This drive made it into our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">PS5 SSD guide</a> because, even at its normal price, it&#39;s a solid budget option for the console as long as you&#39;re willing to supply your own heatsink. It&#39;s an NVMe PCIe SSD with read speeds up to 6,600 MB/s and write speeds up to 5,000 MB/s, and it&#39;s optimized for high-performance gaming and computing.</p><p>For those with tighter budgets who still want to expand their PS5 storage options, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Crucial&#39;s X6" href="https://amzn.to/3HGPiZf">Crucial&#39;s X6</a> external drive in 1TB is 38 percent off right now, bringing it down to $80. Yes, you can use portable SSDs with the console, but there are some limitations: when connected to a PS5, an external drive can only be used to play PS4 titles or store PS5 games. That means you can move a PS5 title out of cold storage when you want to play it, which may be best if you have slower internet speeds impeding your ability to download games quickly. We like the X6 for its fast 540 MB/s read speeds, durable design that&#39;s shock, drop, vibration and temperature resistant and its compatibility with a wide range of devices.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3oONoNC" id="a63144a263674c3884a2cfb8cdcc79dc" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Crucial P5 Plus (1TB) at Amazon - $145</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HGPiZf" id="e08f7504c3364993b06ddf25f497be7c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Crucial X6 (1TB) at Amazon - $80</a><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

It takes great photos thanks to the 24.1-megapixel APS-C sensor, which delivers sharp images with natural colors and skin tones. It also comes with Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel eye-detect autofocus tech, so most of them will be in focus, too. And for social or tourist shooting, it comes with a pop-up flash.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, it can handle 4K video at 24 fps, albeit with a 1.6 times crop. That, along with the flip-up display, makes it very useful as a vlogging camera — and it&#39;s even good for social media because it can also shoot vertical video. The 15-45mm lens, meanwhile, offers a decent zoom range for most types of shooting.</p><p>The downsides are the lack of a viewfinder, though that helps keep the size very small. It also offers a limited lens selection and relatively slow burst shooting speeds. However, it&#39;s a real bargain at $450, which is a cheaper price than most cameras <em>without</em> any lens at all.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

That’s the conclusion of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1537592721002589">new research</a> examining whether targeted warnings could reduce hate speech on the platform.</p><p>Researchers at New York University’s Center for Social Media and Politics found that personalized warnings alerting Twitter users to the consequences of their behavior reduced the number of tweets with hateful language a week after. While more study is needed, the experiment suggests that there is a “potential path forward for platforms seeking to reduce the use of hateful language by users,” according to Mustafa Mikdat Yildirim, the lead author of the paper.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the experiment, researchers identified accounts at risk of being suspended for breaking Twitter’s rules against hate speech. They looked for people who had used at least one word contained in “hateful language dictionaries” over the previous week, who also followed at least one account that had recently been suspended after using such language.</p><p>From there, the researchers created test accounts with personas such as “hate speech warner,” and used the accounts to tweet warnings at these individuals. They tested out several variations, but all had roughly the same message: that using hate speech put them at risk of being suspended, and that it had already happened to someone they follow.</p><p>“The user @account you follow was suspended, and I suspect this was because of hateful language,” reads one sample message shared in the paper. “If you continue to use hate speech, you might get suspended temporarily.” In another variation, the account doing the warning identified themselves as a professional researcher, while also letting the person know they were at risk of being suspended. “We tried to be as credible and convincing as possible,” Yildirim tells Engadget.</p><p>The researchers found that the warnings were effective, at least in the short term. “Our results show that only one warning tweet sent by an account with no more than 100 followers can decrease the ratio of tweets with hateful language by up to 10%,” the authors write. Interestingly, they found that messages that were “more politely phrased” led to even greater declines, with a decrease of up to 20 percent. “We tried to increase the politeness of our message by basically starting our warning by saying that ‘oh, we respect your right to free speech, but on the other hand keep in mind that your hate speech might harm others,’” Yildirim says.</p><p>In the paper, Yildirim and his co-authors note that their test accounts only had around 100 followers each, and that they weren’t associated with an authoritative entity. But if the same type of warnings were to come from Twitter itself, or an NGO or other organization, then the warnings may be even more useful. “The thing that we learned from this experiment is that the real mechanism at play could be the fact that we actually let these people know that there&#39;s some account, or some entity, that is watching and monitoring their behavior,” Yildirim says. “The fact that their use of hate speech is seen by someone else could be the most important factor that led these people to decrease their hate speech.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/personalized-warnings-could-reduce-hate-speech-on-twitter-researchers-say-110029755.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ff29775-1845-4096-82ce-b74ac02dd63a</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 11:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637545026</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T01:37:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/6903eb10-9d49-11eb-9ebc-d0c616a3ce25" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/6903eb10-9d49-11eb-9ebc-d0c616a3ce25" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this photo illustration Twitter logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in Athens, Greece on April 13, 2021 (Photo Illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[App Photo Illustrations]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epson's excellent Home Cinema 4100 4K Pro projector is $500 off right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With features like a 3-chip design that delivers a full RGB color signal with no weird &quot;rainbow&quot; patterns, Epson&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Home Cinema 4010 4K Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3HEgAQd">Home Cinema 4010 4K Pro</a> is one of the best projectors available under $2,000.

It also claimed the top speed of 345.4 MPH over a 3 kilometer (1.86 mile) course and lowest time to a 3,000 meter (9,843 feet) altitude (202 seconds). The records have yet to be certified, but if the 345.5 MPH speed stands, it would beat the current record of 213 MPH — held by a <a href="https://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/extra-330le-electric-aircraft/">Siemens-powered Extra 330LE</a> — by an impressive 132 MPH.&nbsp;</p><p>Rolls-Royce (the aviation, not the car company), conducted the tests on November 16th. To have the records certified, it&#39;s submitting the trials to the <a href="https://www.fai.org/federation">Fédération Aéronautique Internationale</a> (FAI), the body in charge of world aviation records. If confirmed, the speeds would be pretty impressive considering that the plane only made its maiden flight in September — suggesting that with more time, it could go even faster.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Spirit of Innovation is an old-school &quot;tail-dragger&quot; airplane (steering at the rear) with the canopy pushed way back, and looks as fast as it goes. It&#39;s powered by a 400 kW (535 HP), 750 volt motor. Rolls-Royce said it uses the &quot;most power-dense propulsion battery pack ever assembled in aerospace,&quot; with <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/~/media/Files/R/Rolls-Royce/documents/innovation/spirit-of-innovation-factsheet.pdf">6,480 cells</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>As Engadget detailed in an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html">explainer</a>, electric airplanes aren&#39;t practical since current batteries are 50 times less energy dense than jet fuel. However, they do hold some promise for very short trips, like a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-commercial-electric-airplane-test-flight-harbour-air.html">30 minute jaunt</a> between Vancouver and Victoria in Canada. And unlike non-turbocharged ICE engines, electric motors retain full power as an airplane climbs, making them ideal for time-to-altitude record attempts — as the Spirit of Innovation has just shown.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rolls-royces-all-electric-airplane-hits-a-record-3874-mph-top-speed-082803118.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e731a438-3621-48bf-b334-34291689663b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 08:28:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637570065</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T08:34:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Airline Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2e546400-4b67-11ec-baef-325cfe687e6d" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2e546400-4b67-11ec-baef-325cfe687e6d" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[John M Dibbs/Rolls Royce]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rolls Royce's all-electric airplane hits a record 387.4 MPH top speed]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rolls Royce's all-electric airplane hits a record 387.4 MPH top speed]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Hey, Disney' voice assistant comes to Disneyland in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t have to book a trip to Florida to try <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hey-disney-164025746.html">Disney&#39;s Amazon-based voice assistant</a>.

The metropolis will have its own geothermal power plant to help support crypto mining, and there will be no capital gains, income, payroll or property taxes, just value added tax.</p><p>The city will be shaped like a coin. While it should include the full amenities you&#39;d expect from a city, people in La Unión could travel to work in the new development.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bukele didn&#39;t provide a timeline for the city&#39;s creation. However, he simultaneously unveiled a $1 billion US &quot;Bitcoin bond&quot; where half would be used to build energy and mining infrastructure, with the rest used to buy more of the digital currency. The strategy chief for bond developer Blockstream, Samson Mow, said El Salvador would start selling crypto holdings after five years and pay an extra dividend to bond holders. With an initial 6.5 percent yield, this could represent a significant windfall for the country if all goes well.</p><p>The move is a huge gamble for a company with a gross domestic product of just over $24.6 billion in 2020. Bukele&#39;s administration is counting on Bitcoin to spur economic growth, independence and investment, but  this also assumes the monetary format remains on an overall upward trajectory. It&#39;s also unclear if would-be residents and investors will flock to a Bitcoin-oriented city even with tax incentives. This is new territory for cryptocurrency, and it&#39;s not certain if there&#39;s enough support to help the project thrive.</p><div id="36f1cd4aa9be4f16936d5566f25422b1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">¡El Salvador será el primer país del mundo en tener una <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BitcoinCity?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BitcoinCity</a>!<br>Estará entre la ciudad de La Unión y Conchagua.

Core stars Ella Purnell (Jinx), Hailee Steinfeld (Vi) and Katie Leung (Caitlyn) are already set to reprise their roles.</p><p>There&#39;s no mystery behind the decision: the show is a success. Co-creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee said they were &quot;beyond happy&quot; with the reaction. The numbers also back them up — the first season of <em>Arcane</em> racked up nearly 34.2 million viewing hours in its first week on Netflix&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-top-10-chart-transparency-213412386.html">new top 10 chart</a>, making it the second-most popular TV series in any language behind <em>Narcos: Mexico</em> (almost 50.3 million).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The popularity isn&#39;t a shock. Both Netflix and <em>League</em> creator Riot Games heavily promoted the show, to the point where <em>LoL</em> included multiple crossovers. You knew <em>Arcane</em> was available if you were even vaguely interested in the game that inspired it. And yes, it helps that <em>Arcane</em> happens to be well-received by many accounts.</p><p>The renewal doesn&#39;t necessarily hint at a new wave of game-inspired Netflix shows. It does, however, suggest that relatively high-budget game productions have a healthy future at the streaming pioneer. Don&#39;t be surprised if Netflix takes more chances on projects like this.</p><div id="70f443c97c6b401c9230b256966f3e26"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ready yourselves, friends.

Albums should be listened to &quot;as [artists] intended&quot; as they tell &quot;a story,&quot; the singer explained in a follow-up on Twitter.</p><p>You can still shuffle an album using the controls for individual songs. This mainly adds an extra step and pushes you to choose a first track. Rivals like Apple Music still let you tap a &quot;shuffle&quot; button from an album page.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s no question some albums are meant to be played in order, including <em>30</em>. It weaves a narrative around an important time in Adele&#39;s life. However, critics have already raised concerns about removing a feature to please an artist. It&#39;s one thing to recommend playing albums a certain way, but it&#39;s another to take control away from listeners to dictate that order — and what about artists who are happy to allow shuffle play?</p><p>Spotify has an incentive to make changes like this, at least. Adele&#39;s lead single for <em>30</em>, &quot;Easy On Me,&quot; broke a single-day Spotify streaming record previously held by K-pop megagroup BTS. While Spotify hasn&#39;t outlined its rationale, the company probably isn&#39;t eager to antagonize one of its most important musicians and risk losing customers.</p><div id="dd3791e6496e4ca486c04e05f846b00d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This was the only request I had in our ever changing industry!

Meta might face pressure to change its plans by the time the law takes effect.</p><p>Davis said Meta would still have the power to detect abuse through a combination of unencrypted info and user reports. The delay might also offer time to reassure governments and head off potential conflicts.

Just remember that Fitbit&#39;s data doesn&#39;t directly funnel into third-party platforms like Apple Health.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-amazon-sale-november-2021-145817573.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2de3b84a-a210-441a-ae9a-9aafbb3c3f31</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 21 Nov 2021 14:58:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637506699</ingested><modified>2021-11-21T14:58:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/027e8150-4ad4-11ec-bfb9-d22865813b28" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/027e8150-4ad4-11ec-bfb9-d22865813b28" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch SE with silver aluminum case and Abyss Blue Sport Band]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch SE with silver aluminum case and Abyss Blue Sport Band]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo bundles 'Mario Kart 8' with the Switch for Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We all know that Nintendo doesn’t discount its games often, so Black Friday ends up being one of the few times you can snag a great deal on its consoles and first party games.

The Center for Democracy &amp; Technology&#39;s Alexandra Givens told the <em>AP</em> the bill doesn&#39;t account for other biases, such as ableism or ageism.

As you might have guessed, though, this wasn&#39;t the results of a (non-existent) feature update during that period. Rather, the blame appears to rest on app prompts and more than a little confusion.</p><p>The iPhone maker told <em>The Verge</em> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">iOS 15.1</a> started prompting users for ratings and reviews &quot;just like most third-party apps.&quot; However, many people thought they were rating the show they were listening to, not the app — and that led to a flood of scores and reviews for podcasts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This issue hasn&#39;t affected many other first-party apps, such as Apple Maps (2.8 stars as of this writing). Even iTunes Store <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/itunes-store/id915061235#see-all/reviews">ratings</a>, while high (4.8 stars), include reviews that largely focus on the app rather than the content.</p><p>The prompts do bring functional consistency to Apple&#39;s apps — it&#39;s easy to trash them if you like. At the same time, though, the mixups are inflating Podcasts&#39; value and rendering the scores useless for many people deciding on podcast clients. The shift also underscores the problem with trusting ratings and reviews regardless of platform. It&#39;s still relatively easy for misguided users, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pro-palestinian-activists-facebook-app-rating-protest-211008340.html">activists</a> and fraudsters to skew that feedback.</p><div id="f9d9a30d81dd41219c859a384529769b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">All the new positive reviews appear to be talking about specific podcasts, instead of the app: <a href="https://t.co/HCo7WCcmH3">pic.twitter.com/HCo7WCcmH3</a></p>— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1460856197393772547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-podcasts-app-review-score-prompts-215857401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a03308b1-595c-4c9e-8bd2-9b4a2caa3fa9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 21:58:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637445539</ingested><modified>2021-11-20T21:59:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/6e44d970-5ba8-11e9-acf6-1f8819b37dcf" width="4221" height="2804" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/6e44d970-5ba8-11e9-acf6-1f8819b37dcf" width="4221" height="2804" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Podcast application is seen on an Apple iPad on October 24, 2017.

First, Mat Smith checked out the new SharePlay feature on iOS 15.1 and determined it has potential. Next, Billy Steele listened to the Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones and found them to be just as comfortable as their predecessors, and with improved noise cancellation, too. Nathan Ingraham put the HP Chromebook X2 to the test and found the lightweight laptop has a stellar screen that’s ideal for travel. Steve Dent turned the dial on ASUS’s ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED laptop, which he says has an exceptionally color accurate screen and thoughtful features for creatives. Finally, Terrence O’Brien made a few stickers and decals with the Cricut Explore 3.</p><h2>iOS 15.1 rolls out the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">new SharePlay feature</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cd60a720-4969-11ec-bef3-d5f411982434" alt="Apple iOS 15.1" data-uuid="b3a19b3e-7790-3e4e-baa1-4608cdb299f6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>Mat Smith calls iOS 15.1 a relatively minor update when compared to the more drastic changes brought by iOS 14. A good bulk of the additions here come from the release of SharePlay, which allows you to do things like stream TV shows with a friend over FaceTime. Mat said that the shows were lag free in testing, the fitness apps were motivating and the free games were more fun than he expected. However, SharePlay isn’t available for all apps — for instance, YouTube and Netflix are not supported right now.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mat also tested spatial audio, which gives callers directional sound, but he was more impressed by the new voice isolation and wide modes. He also played around with Focus modes, which help you track and limit your screen time via profiles and the ability to “lock” yourself out of your phone for set periods of time. Mat points out that these features, in addition to the machine learning improvements with Visual Look-up and Live Text, show that Apple is rededicating itself towards sharing.</p><h2>HP’s Chromebook X2 makes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-chromebook-x2-review-162005261.html">a great first impression</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7b0ddd70-496a-11ec-bc57-06274e606c55" alt="HP Chromebook X2" data-uuid="cc7b511e-ba38-3df1-ac59-b96320056fe2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham/Engadget</div></figure><p>Nathan Ingraham found the hardware on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP Chromebook X2" href="https://fave.co/31MYhaR">HP Chromebook X2</a> to be well built, sturdy and simple in design. He called the bright 11-inch, 2,160 x 1,440 touchscreen a standout that made work feel less cramped thanks in part to its 3:2 aspect ratio. The keyboard was responsive with good travel, and he liked that the included stylus attached neatly and magnetically to the side. When it came to performance, he found the X2 to do well for watching videos, browsing the web and playing games.</p><p>However, he found the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c mobile processor struggled when it came time to push the machine with intensive tasks. Though he was able to run his usual programs, it wasn’t the fastest experience and he said he avoided playing music from the device while running a lot of other apps because it would cause slowdowns. That being said, its stellar battery life, size and lightweight design make the Chromebook X2 a solid secondary or travel device.</p><h2>The ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-pro-art-studiobook-16-oled-review-the-best-windows-creator-laptop-150041474.html">laptop for creatives</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a977e250-496a-11ec-8be5-ce2e9acfd640" alt="ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16 OLED" data-uuid="c51a6c48-bed2-37de-8a31-dbd71038ad3a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Steve Dent says the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ASUS ProArt Studiobook" href="https://fave.co/3kuNUyZ">ASUS ProArt Studiobook</a> is clearly intended to woo artists and creatives with its fast performance, gorgeous 16-inch 4K OLED screen and the “ASUS dial” for video and photo editing. The screen is factory-calibrated to Pantone and Calman color accuracy, and has a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio with inky blacks that make it good for content creation and streaming entertainment. It also features an “IceCool Pro” thermal solution to boost airflow while keeping noise levels minimal. Steve found this to hold true during testing, except for very GPU/CPU intensive tasks, which did bump up the noise levels.</p><p>He was also particularly impressed with the dial, which he says feels nice with a textured grip and smooth rotation. The location is convenient and the dial can be used to adjust volume or display brightness as well as to access menu options from four Adobe apps. Steve was also pleased with the number of ports on the machine, including a USB-C with DisplayPort support and an SD Express card slot. In testing, the laptop performed well during both gaming and editing tasks, thanks in part to a RTX 3070 GPU and AMD Ryzen 9 CPU. On top of that, Steve found it had a solid battery life, too, which lead him to declare the Studiobook 16 the best Windows 10 laptop for content creation.</p><h2>Bose makes minor but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html">appreciated updates</a> with the QuietComfort 45 headphones</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f9ecf5e0-496a-11ec-976b-610c6b36e5c0" alt="Bose QuietComfort 45" data-uuid="10c057d0-fbdf-36db-a3e5-06805c781eba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Billy Steele isn’t disappointed that Bose didn’t update the design of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:QuietComfort 45" href="https://amzn.to/3csDpIf">QuietComfort 45</a> headphones. In fact, he was pleased that the company kept so much of what made the previous model popular, from the light weight to the physical buttons and cushiony pads. He reports that the new headphones keep the sound quality that Bose is known for, with crisp highs, robust mids and deep bass. The QC45 sounded good across multiple genres and the updated noise cancelling removed more background sounds than the last model.</p><p>New to the QC45 is an ambient sound or aware mode, which allows you to hear what’s happening around you. Billy said it’s serviceable but not the best he’s experienced. While testing, he managed to get 22.5 hours worth of playback before he needed to recharge the headphones. However, he did find the multi-device connectivity a bit frustrating as it required him to reconnect after ending a call. Overall, he still feels that the newest QuietComfort cans offer a lot for folks who travel frequently and need a comfortable set of headphones with exceptional noise cancelling capabilities.</p><h2>Cricut’s Explore 3 cutting machine is for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cricut-explore-3-review-precision-cutting-machine-arts-and-crafts-170053940.html">devoted crafters</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a6cd6650-496b-11ec-b7ce-a0eba766a7dd" alt="Circuit Explore 3" data-uuid="340d0376-7646-3315-8981-6f93bf9be0b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien admits he’s not the core audience for a Circuit craft machine. Designed to cut hundreds of different types of materials, the Circuit line can make vinyl transfers for shirts, 3D cardboard masks, stickers, decals, iron-ons and more. However, his beginner crafting level didn’t stop him from thoroughly enjoying the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Cricut Explore 3" href="https://fave.co/3nraY3E">Cricut Explore 3</a>, which he said felt like magic to use. In testing, he created a Spiderman emblem for a Halloween costume, several laptop stickers and (most of) a 3D cardboard fox.</p><p>Terrence said he found the companion app easy to use: it also offers access to over 1,000 free images and 250 projects. Even more are available via the $10 a month Cricut Access membership and you can upload your own designs. He appreciated the detailed instructions for the predesigned projects, but points out that projects often required a lot of additional add-ons like a scoring stylus or foil transfer tool. Overall, Terrence says whether or not the $300 Explore 3 (or $400 Maker 3) is worth it to you is going to depend a lot on how often you’ll use it — and what other materials you already have on hand.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-its-finally-time-to-test-shareplay-on-apple-ios-15-1-170037187.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e89f24f6-2c7b-4fc1-bcc7-5e4c7bdc9549</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 17:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637350812</ingested><modified>2021-11-19T19:40:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/19c17040-42ee-11ec-b91b-0b35e1ae5116" width="2000" height="1363" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/19c17040-42ee-11ec-b91b-0b35e1ae5116" width="2000" height="1363" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iOS 15 review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iOS 15 review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: An ode to the joy of antibiotics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The stress and uncertainty surrounding the COVID pandemic, along with misinformation about the life-saving vaccines developed in response have <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/aaron-rodgers-discusses-positive-covid-19-test-im-in-the-crosshairs-of-the-woke-mob-right-now-173236045.html">broken many a weak mind</a> over the past two years, leading people to try everything from injecting themselves with bleach and inhaling nebulized hydrogen peroxide, to slugging down horse dewormer in misguided attempts to outwit modern medicine. Surprise, none of it actually works. What&#39;s worse is that this sort of behavior is nothing new. Quack homeopathic remedies have existed for centuries — <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/z7r7hyc/revision/4">curing the bubonic plague through blood letting, self-flagellation, or sitting in hot sewers to drive off the fever, for example</a> — and supported by little more than anecdotal evidence.</p><p>In their latest book, <a href="https://www.workman.com/products/patient-zero/hardback"><em>Patient Zero: A Curious History of the World&#39;s Worst Diseases</em></a><em>,</em> Dr. Lydia Kang and Nate Pedersen delve into the fascinating histories of some of humanity&#39;s deadliest diseases and the society-preserving works of the scientists who the developed cures, vaccines and treatments to counter them.

Workman Publishing © 2021</p><hr><p>Aside from putting barriers between us and plagues, the next primary approach to defeating them was to attack them directly, thanks to breakthroughs in science that created and discovered antibiotics and antitoxins. Some of these medicines aren’t simply employed against microorganisms like bacteria, but act as antifungals, antivirals, and antiparasitics as well. Today, there are more than a hundred types of medicines in this group. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a list of medicines deemed essential for a country’s healthcare system to best care for its citizenry, and a large chunk of those essential meds battle infectious diseases.</p><p>Some might assume that penicillin was the first definitive weapon discovered in our fight against pathogens, but there were several that preceded it and broke significant ground when they were discovered.</p><p>The Prussian-born Emil von Behring was a doctor and an assistant to the famed Robert Koch at the Institute for Hygiene in Berlin. In 1888, he developed a way to treat those suffering from diphtheria and tetanus. Not a disease familiar to many these days, diphtheria is prevented by a vaccine that is usually coupled with your routine tetanus shot. In the 1800s, diphtheria was a terrible killer that inflamed a victim’s heart, inflicted paralysis, and caused a suffocating membrane to cover the throat. In Spain, the disease was so rampant in 1613 it was nicknamed <em>El Año de los Garrotillos</em>, or “The Year of Strangulations.”</p><p>Much of the disease caused by diphtheria is driven by the toxin created by <em>Corynebacterium diphtheriae</em>. Von Behring infected rats, rabbits, and guinea pigs with weakened (attenuated) forms of it, then gathered their serum—the liquid fraction of their blood, minus the red and white blood cells. That light, honey-colored liquid, which contained antibodies to the diphtheria toxin, was then injected into another set of animals that were sickened with fully virulent diphtheria bacteria.</p><p>The newly infected animals given the serum didn’t die because they gained a passive form of protection against the toxin with the donated serum. In 1891, a child’s life was saved using this new method for the first time. The serum was produced in large quantities using animals like sheep and horses. At a time when 50,000 children died annually from diphtheria, it was a miraculous treatment.</p><p>Tetanus serum was created soon after, becoming a workable treatment by 1915. Today, antitoxins are used to treat botulism, diphtheria, and anthrax. The same principles of antitoxin treatment are utilized for antivenom therapy to remedy poisonous animal bites, including those from black widow spiders, scorpions, box jellyfish, and cobras. A treatment called passive antibody therapy, in which the serum of patients recovered from an infection is given to other sick patients (also called convalescent plasma therapy), may have been helpful during the COVID-19 pandemic, though data is still forthcoming. Antibodies against infections can not only treat diseases like toxic shock syndrome, but prevent infections during exposures, such as those for hepatitis A and B and botulism. But the antibodies themselves have been employed to treat more than just bites, stings, and infections. Intravenous immunoglobulins from pooled donors treat a variety of disorders, such as ITP (immune thrombocytopenia) and severe immune deficiency diseases.</p><p>Another antibody therapy—monoclonal antibodies—has been a game-changer in treatments over the last decade or so, the first one approved by the FDA in 1986. These specially designed antibodies are used to treat several types of cancers (melanoma, breast, and stomach, among many others) and autoimmune diseases (including Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis). The antibodies themselves are Y-shaped proteins that bind to a specific protein. In doing so, they can elicit a whole range of effects: switching on or off immune system cascades, destroying cells, blocking or engaging cell activities. The antibodies only bind to a single antigen, hence “mono,” and are produced by clones of cells that churn out the antibodies in large amounts. Sometimes they can also be bound to radioactive particles, delivering radioactivity directly to a cancer cell. Others can be bound to a chemotherapy agent. Often, they work alone.</p><p>In the realm of cancer therapy, most of us have some understanding of chemotherapy. But the origin of the term chemotherapy itself actually came from the fight to treat infections, not cancer. At the turn of the twentieth century, antibiotics had yet to establish themselves as a cure for infections. That changed with a physician and scientist named Paul Ehrlich. He was born in 1854 in East Prussia (now Poland) where his father ran a lottery office. During his career, he took advantage of the burgeoning German dye industry to experiment on how cells looked stained with different chemicals. His love of color led to some notable idiosyncrasies, like carrying colored pencil stubs in his pockets. But Ehrlich’s work led to what would become the famous Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain for tuberculosis. (Unfortunately, he also stained his very own TB bacteria from his sputum, though luckily survived the illness.) Later he collaborated with the aforementioned Emil von Behring, a Nobel Prize–winning physiologist, on serum therapy for tetanus and diphtheria.</p><p>But perhaps Ehrlich’s most notable discovery happened by accident as he sought a chemical cure to treat a specific disease—a “chemotherapy.” Specifically, he hoped to cure sleeping sickness, a disease caused by a microscopic parasite called <em>Trypanosoma brucei</em>. He had been working with a chemical called atoxyl (meaning “nontoxic”), ironically an arsenic compound. Ehrlich coined the term “magic bullet” related to his hope of finding that perfect chemical that would hopefully kill a very specific pathogen, the <em>Trypanosoma</em> parasite, and not the patient. He ended up testing nine hundred variations of the arsenic compounds on mice. None were particularly effective, but he revisited #606 because it seemed to have an effect on a newly discovered bacterium believed to cause syphilis. In 1910, the medicine called Salvarsan (sometimes simply called “606”) was proven to be effective—it killed the syphilis spirochete and left the guinea pigs, rabbits, and mice alive.</p><p>In the next few decades, new research would be applied to battle not just the pandemics of old, but daily infections that could upend people’s lives. A scratch or bite could kill if those <em>Staphylococcus</em> or <em>Streptococcus</em> infections spiraled out of control. A German scientist named Gerhard Domagk began working with a group of chemicals called azo dyes that had a characteristic double nitrogen bond. Azo dyes can color textiles, leather, and foods various shades of brilliant orange, red, and yellow. When an azo compound had a sulfonamide group attached (a nitrogen and sulfur link with two oxygen atoms double-bonded to the sulfur, should you need to impress friends at a party), they knew they’d found something special. The sulfonamide group inhibits a bacteria’s ability to make folate, a necessary B vitamin. Humans, on the other hand, can obtain folate through their diet. And so another magic bullet was born. The new compound seemed to work in mice infected with <em>Streptococcus</em>, otherwise known as strep.</p><p>Domagk used the new medicine, called KL 730 and later patented as Prontosil, on his own daughter Hildegard. Suffering from a severe strep infection, she received a shot of Prontosil and recovered, though the drug left a telltale dyed, reddish discoloration at the injection site.</p><p>“Sulfa” drugs would go on to be used in a variety of medicines, including antibiotics (trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole, aka Bactrim), diabetes medicines (glyburide, a sulfonylurea), diuretics (furosemide, or Lasix), pain meds (celecoxib, or Celebrex), and are also used today to treat pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, and urinary tract infections, among others.</p><p>Domagk’s work won him the Nobel Prize in 1935. However, the Nazis, who disapproved of how the Nobel committee tried to help German pacifist Carl von Ossietzky, had their Gestapo arrest Domagk for accepting the prize and forced him to give it back. He was able to receive it later in 1947.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-patient-zero-lydia-kang-nate-pederson-workman-publishing-163030051.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">40a015b5-070e-4d01-856a-05325e42d549</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 20 Nov 2021 16:30:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636137102</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T18:31:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a6d0ae90-3d1e-11ec-bbed-dcb96101f5dd" width="6942" height="4628" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/91a25190-3d1e-11ec-bfd4-984b39658db5" width="5933" height="2696" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fahroni via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Colorful capsule pills in plastic box.
