Apple is now treating its apps more as equals, though. <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/29/rate-and-review-apple-iphone-built-in-apps/">notes</a> Apple has quietly enabled App Store ratings and reviews for its own software. If you want to laud <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-3d-maps-rollout-ios-15-london-washington-dc-canada-161715719.html">improvements to Maps</a> or trash Mail, you can.</p><p>The volume of reviews is relatively low compared to equivalent third-party apps that have been around for years, like Gmail or Google Maps. However, it won&#39;t surprise you to hear the ratings are relatively low. Apple&#39;s Podcasts client is sitting at two stars as of this writing, while Apple News is sitting at 2.3 stars. Maps has only partly mended its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-09-28-tim-cook-apologizes-for-maps-mess.html">early reputation</a> with a three-star rating. Like with third-party software, some customers are using the ratings and reviews to gripe about technical issues instead of design.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The change treats Apple&#39;s apps more fairly, and might even be useful to help the company spot and respond to criticism. It might likewise see this as another way to improve public perception of the App Store. On top of an Epic lawsuit that could soon force Apple to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">alter App Store policies</a>, the iPhone maker has preemptively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-apple-app-store-search-rank-changes.html">stopped favoring its own apps</a> in rankings and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-rolls-out-small-business-program-fees-051742717.html">reduced its cut</a> of small developers&#39; apps revenues. Ratings and reviews won&#39;t dramatically change Apple&#39;s image, but they likely won&#39;t hurt.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-allows-rating-first-party-app-store-apps-230528659.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa18a187-651a-42f4-ae04-1b038330b8f1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 23:05:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632953083</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T22:04:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1dcd9640-fafb-11eb-8fde-3d5cdabb0674" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1dcd9640-fafb-11eb-8fde-3d5cdabb0674" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[App Store icon displayed on a phone screen is seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on July 18, 2021.

Shortly after Amazon announced its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-blink-video-doorbell-floodlight-camera-170141201.html">dirt-cheap $50 Blink video doorbell</a>, <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Message-from-our-GM-Updates-for-our-Nest-customers/ba-p/17122">Nest VP Rishi Chandra announced </a>that Google <em>also</em> has a competing second-generation Nest Doorbell coming next year. And unlike the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-doorbell-camera-battery-powered-floodlight-130016075.html">recently launched battery-powered Nest Doorbell</a>, the new device will be hardwired like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-27-nest-hello-review.html">original Nest Hello</a>. That opens the door for 24/7 video recording, something the battery-powered cameras can&#39;t handle due to thermal issues (plus you&#39;d likely have to recharge them often).</p><p>Chandra also says Google plans to launch a web view for the Home app next year as well, which will allow you to control cameras and other devices from your computer. Honestly, it&#39;s a shock Google still hasn&#39;t managed to build that, especially when competitors like Arlo and Ring have offered them for years. Google also plans to bring older Nest devices into the Google Home app eventually, but for now, Nest customers will have to juggle between two separate apps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-doorbell-wired-24-7-recording-220749729.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">002cc7eb-9e4f-43f6-b3c1-171c5c24644f</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 22:07:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632949502</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T21:05:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eeff9c80-2167-11ec-af7f-697d3e361ad8" width="675" height="380" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eeff9c80-2167-11ec-af7f-697d3e361ad8" width="675" height="380" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[A revamped wired Nest Doorbell is coming in 2022 with 24/7 video recording]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bungie makes it easier to sue over harassment following Activision scandal]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bungie <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-10-bungie-takes-control-of-publishing-destiny.html">split from Activision</a> a long time ago, but that isn&#39;t stopping the company from distancing itself from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html">sexual harassment scandal</a> affecting its former publisher. The <em>Destiny 2</em> creator is <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/50746">implementing</a> a number of reforms that it hopes will foster diversity and inclusion, prevent harassment and clamp down if abuse takes place. Most notably, it&#39;s joining other tech companies in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-easier-sue-arbitration-claims-090815254.html">dropping the mandatory arbitration clause</a> in employee agreements. It should be easier for harassment targets to sue and otherwise make their complaints public.</p><p>The company has also hired inclusion-oriented leaders, including a Chief People Officer and an as yet unnamed but &quot;deeply experienced&quot; director. Bungie is further reviewing its hiring practices to prevent biased selections, and is adding a third-party anonymous reporting tool (on top of existing options) to reduce the reluctance to flag harassment. CEO Pete Parsons added that half of Bungie&#39;s board, and four out of nine executives, were either women or from underrepresented demographics.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Parsons stressed that there was &quot;more that can be done,&quot; and that there was no ideal ending. He felt it was important for Bungie to set an example for others, though, and was hopeful the game industry as a whole would improve its practices.</p><p>Bungie hasn&#39;t faced harassment allegations like Activision, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-07-riot-games-walk-out-sexism-lawsuits-arbitration.html">Riot Games</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-harassment-lawsuit-france-205931367.html">Ubisoft</a>. This appears to be a proactive step rather than a reaction to internal turmoil. All the same, the move illustrates the pressure on developers to rethink their anti-harassment strategies — studios like Bungie want to prevent incidents long before they lead to lawsuits and protests.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bungie-drops-arbitration-boosts-inclusivity-efforts-212351819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">46011e46-5a12-4a75-9d4a-1ede59ff11b8</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 21:23:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632948189</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T20:43:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/e9396220-720f-11eb-9f2f-536857a6479f" width="5064" height="3384" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/e9396220-720f-11eb-9f2f-536857a6479f" width="5064" height="3384" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chesnot via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 31:  A gamer plays the video game 'Destiny 2' developed by Bungie Studios and published by Activision during the 'Paris Games Week' on October 31, 2017 in Paris, France.

From content streaming infotainment systems to the background processes that interpret sensor data and power the advanced driver assist features, software has become a fundamental component in modern vehicles. To better manage those countless lines of code, GM announced on Wednesday that it has developed an end-to-end software platform, dubbed Ulfiti (rhymes with &quot;multiply&quot;).</p><p>GM&#39;s latest vehicles already enjoy features like OTA software updates and on-board internet connectivity thanks to the company&#39;s Vehicle Intelligence Platform (VIP). the Linux-based Ulfiti is designed to sit on top of that existing architecture and serve as a central hub for select software systems, separating them from the vehicle&#39;s core operations.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;In all of the embedded controllers, we refactored them and extracted the software from the hardware out of them, making them available to our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture">SOA layer</a>,&quot; Scott Miller, Vice President of Software Defined Vehicle. at General Motors, said during a recent teleconference. &quot;Basically we&#39;re abstracting them and making them available for a powerful hub for all the vehicle&#39;s systems.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Then we&#39;re adding this service oriented layer on our high performance computing that we have in the vehicle for infotainment and safety,&quot; he continued. &quot;And we&#39;re going to organize those abstractions as services.&quot;</p><p>This will enable GM to more quickly develop and deploy updates, new features and apps to customers. In essence, Ultifi will serve a similar function as Android does on smartphones — an API layer sitting between the underlying hardware and the end user. GM did note that Ultifi will run in conjunction with existing automotive OSes, such as Android Automotive, which GM announced in 2019 it would begin supporting.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Android Automotive is a certain subset of functionality in the car,&quot; Darryl Harrison, GM&#39;s Director of Global Product Development, explained. &quot;Ultifi is more of an umbrella overall strategy. Some vehicles will have Android Automotive and some will have other infotainment apps and services.&quot;</p><p>In essence, GM wants to treat your vehicle like a rolling smartphone, offering users continuous OTA updates, cloud-based personalization options that drivers can transfer between GM vehicles, and smart home connectivity. The company is also considering pushing out various safety and comfort upgrades through via OTA, such as using the vehicle&#39;s onboard cameras to automatically engage the child locks when they detect children in the back seat or remotely closing the vehicle&#39;s sunroof if you parked outdoors and the weather forecast calls for rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>GM is also considering using Ultifi to offer subscription services to users, such as on-demand Supercruise that drivers can enable on long road trips but cancel once they reach their destination. Ulfiti could also allow for improved V2V (vehicle to vehicle) and V2X (vehicle to everything) applications including near-real time traffic and road hazard updates. Expect to see Ulfiti in select GM vehicles — both internal combustion and EV — starting in 2023.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-ultifi-software-hub-update-ev-smartphone-190041857.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd22d307-986d-4929-ba8e-f1d2d164be42</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 19:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632945596</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T19:59:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/29cbf850-06a0-11ec-ab45-bd72c97d6ea1" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/29cbf850-06a0-11ec-ab45-bd72c97d6ea1" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bill Pugliano via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DETROIT, MI - AUGUST 05: A GMC Hummer EV truck is shown at General Motors Factory Zero on August 5, 2021 in Detroit, Michigan.

An update in early 2022 will let you ask a question after snapping a photo.

Without an address, you can&#39;t get mail or packages, nor can you vote or sign up for bank accounts, for example. Emergency responders can&#39;t even find you easily if you don&#39;t have an address. Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-plus-codes-android-address-system-160019436.html">open-source Plus Codes system</a> has been around since 2015 to help assign addresses to places, matching a series of letters and numbers to a set of latitude and longitude coordinates.</p><p>But, according to Google, &quot;previously, creating addresses for an entire town or village could take years.&quot; The company is releasing a new tool today called Address Maker that would make mass generation of these codes easier for governments and organizations. Google said that governments and non-government organizations (NGOs) in Kenya, India, South African and the US are already using Address Maker, &quot;with more partners on the way.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Anyone can enter one of these codes, which look like &quot;P2J5+7C,&quot; into Google Maps and see where that place is or get directions. For people who already have existing addresses that are long or complicated, these could be helpful in making sure your contacts find you at the correct spot. If you&#39;ve ever tried to send a package to an industrial area in a country you&#39;re not familiar with, you&#39;ll probably find Plus Codes helpful, too.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/100afd00-213d-11ec-9ddf-45c99c7c5324" alt="An animated GIF showing how Google&#39;s new Address Maker app works.

By tapping on the three dots icon located next to most results, the tool allows you to find out more about a website before you navigate to it. With the initial rollout of About This Result, Google displayed information from Wikipedia, and, if that wasn’t available, it pulled what it could from one of its services. The panels also included details about the website like when it was first indexed by the company, and if you could expect a secure connection.</p><p>Today, Google is making those panels more robust by adding to the diversity of information they display. To start, in addition to a description from Wikipedia, you’ll see what each website has to say about itself in its own words. You will also see what others have had to say about them — be that through reviews or a simple news article. In the “about the topic” section, Google will include other coverage or results from different sources.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As before, the idea behind the About This Result feature is to save you an extra search when you want to find out more about a website you’re about to visit. Google also sees it as a way to help people make more informed decisions about how they use the internet and provide peace of mind if you’re looking for important information related to important topics.&nbsp;</p><p>Aside from these &quot;Information Literacy features,&quot; the company also announced new features coming to its results pages during its Search On event today. They&#39;re called Things to Know, Refine This Search, Broaden This Search and Related Topics to its results to make it easier to learn more about different topics. Things To Know, for example, will pull up the basics you&#39;ll need to understand a new subject, while refining and broadening your search can help you explore related issues.</p><p>Google Search users in the US will see today&#39;s expansion roll out over the coming weeks and months.</p><p><em>Cherlynn Low contributed to this post.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-about-this-result-update-170038402.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c0c58ef1-0741-4090-9a72-b41811386d25</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic,Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 17:35:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632937373</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T17:43:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/73d50060-2142-11ec-afeb-321198cb8e51" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/73d50060-2142-11ec-afeb-321198cb8e51" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google About the Source]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google About the Source]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Maps will roll out wildfire tracking worldwide]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has introduced a wildfire layer for Maps, allowing users around the world to keep a close eye on multiple fires at once.

The wildfire layer will start its global rollout to Android devices this week and to iOS devices and PCs in October. While it will display most major fires — the kind that necessitates evacuations — around the world, it&#39;ll have the capability to display smaller incidents in the US, thanks to data provided by the National Interagency Fire Center. Google is planning to offer that level of detail in more locations, starting with Australia in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e5c88d20-210d-11ec-ba8f-18765f47d12c" alt="Google" data-uuid="ff564a74-8314-3e8b-9a96-1be4cb7ce021"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>In addition, Google is expanding the information available through its Tree Canopy tool. At the moment, it can only provide data for 15 cities in the US, but it&#39;ll be able to show information for 100 cities around the world in 2022. Google&#39;s Tree Canopy Insights combines AI capabilities with aerial data to determine the parts of a city with the greatest risk of rapidly rising temperatures. It could help local governments figure out where to plant trees and where to focus any project they may have to fight climate change. Los Angeles authorities, for instance, are already using the tool to help them increase the city&#39;s tree canopy by 50 percent by 2028. While Google didn&#39;t say which cities are getting access to the tool by next year, it said Guadalajara, London, Sydney and Toronto are in the list.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-wildfire-tracking-worldwide-170837067.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1bc2e388-1135-4ad1-a04f-d2cac2d76a5e</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 17:08:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632935321</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T17:08:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e3ad2400-2109-11ec-ba9f-88ec9d360ea2" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e3ad2400-2109-11ec-ba9f-88ec9d360ea2" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kara Capaldo via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Firefighters battleing fire as Flames approaching Highway 50 during Caldor Fire in California]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Caldor Fire California]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[IMDb's free TV service arrives in the UK]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Folks in the UK looking for a show or movie to stream have even more options at their disposal. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/imdb%20tv"><ins>IMDb TV</ins></a> is now available in the country.</p><p>The free, ad-supported service offers a mix of originals and popular movies and shows from elsewhere, as <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/09/amazon-launches-ad-supported-streamer-imdb-tv-uk-1234846526/"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a> notes.

He was also less-than-flattering to Virgin Galactic, describing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">first passenger flight</a> and Blue Origin&#39;s as &quot;a step in the direction of orbit&quot; that fell short of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-spacex-inspiration4-splashdown-live-stream-214529012.html">SpaceX&#39;s efforts</a>.</p><p>While Musk is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-08-elon-musk-painted-as-thin-skinned-billionaire-in-court-documen.html">known for being harsh</a>, he might have some support in this case. <em>The Verge</em> has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22689729/blue-origin-moon-lunar-lander-price-nasa-hls-foia">obtained</a> NASA legal documents showing that the space agency felt Blue Origin &quot;gambled&quot; with its originally proposed $5.9 billion lunar lander price. Bezos&#39; company allegedly set the price far higher than necessary as it expected NASA to award the contract and negotiate for a lower cost. Blue Origin also reportedly assumed NASA would get the full funding from Congress needed for that initial price, even as the Senate made clear NASA wouldn&#39;t get the necessary amount.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You know what happened next. Rather than haggle the price, NASA picked the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">$2.9 billion SpaceX bid</a>. Blue Origin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gao-denies-blue-origin-dynetics-protest-nasa-human-landing-system-181019362.html">challenged the award</a> and even made a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-nasa-open-letter-181522642.html">last-ditch $2 billion offer</a>, but by then it was too late. The Government Accountability Office <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gao-denies-blue-origin-dynetics-protest-nasa-human-landing-system-181019362.html">rejected Blue Origin&#39;s claims</a>, saying NASA didn&#39;t violate regulations in picking SpaceX. Bezos&#39; outfit took NASA to court roughly two weeks later.</p><p>In an interview, Blue Origin VP Megan Mitchell told <em>The Verge</em> the company rejected NASA&#39;s views. She felt Blue Origin made a &quot;great offer&quot; and that it disagreed with NASA&#39;s gambling characterization. The GAO separately said NASA partly botched its safety review requirements for the proposal, although it still sided with SpaceX on grounds that Blue Origin didn&#39;t explain how the move provided an unfair edge.</p><p>This isn&#39;t to say Musk and SpaceX are innocent. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-22-spacex-sues-over-air-force-contracts.html">SpaceX sued the US</a> in 2019 after it lost an Air Force rocket contract to Blue Origin and other competitors, for example. It&#39;s just that Musk&#39;s trash talking appears to carry some weight in this modern Moon race.</p><p><strong>Update 9/29 5PM ET:</strong> An Amazon spokesperson, not Blue Origin, emailed Engadget claiming SpaceX has a &quot;long track record&quot; of suing the US government over contracts and other decisions. To that end, it even sent a lengthy document listing 16 lawsuits and regulatory objections from SpaceX. Most of them are FCC oppositions, and some of the other issues are quite old (such as a 2004 lawsuit). One thing&#39;s for certain: the slap fight between Musk and Bezos is getting uglier by the day.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-on-blue-origin-lawsuit-151130133.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5dceae2-669d-432e-bd0b-bc16a12e0509</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 15:11:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632949364</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T21:02:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d85fc750-fe4b-11eb-8e55-f2f4f16e40da" width="3678" height="2706" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d85fc750-fe4b-11eb-8e55-f2f4f16e40da" width="3678" height="2706" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PATRICK PLEUL via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US entrepreneur and business magnate Elon Musk gestures during a visit at the Tesla Gigafactory plant under construction, on August 13, 2021 in Gruenheide near Berlin, eastern Germany.

However, the company&#39;s more affordable options are still due for a refresh, and Sony begins that process today. With the <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/truly-wireless/p/wfc500">WF-C500</a>, the company offers a solid set of true wireless earbuds capable of handling immersive 360 Reality Audio for $100. And if over-ear noise-cancelling headphones are more your vibe, the <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/whxb910n">WF-XB910N</a> pairs ANC (active noise cancellation) with 30-hour battery life for $250.&nbsp;</p><p>The true wireless WF-C500 replaces the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-xb700-review-true-wireless-earbuds-163042660.html">WF-XB700</a> at the bottom of Sony&#39;s price range. What&#39;s more, they&#39;re $30 cheaper than the XB700 was initially at $99.99. This substitution is a good thing because despite handling the basics well, the tiered design wasn&#39;t as ergonomic or comfy as the company suggested. With the WF-C500, Sony takes design cues from its high-end WF-1000XM4 earbuds. The result is smaller size and a more secure fit that should be more comfortable during hours of continuous use. And an IPX4 rating means you can use these during workouts without worrying about moisture damage.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Inside, the C500 is equipped with Sony&#39;s DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine) that restores some of the detail lost when music is compressed for streaming over Bluetooth. The company also allows you employ sound presets and adjust the EQ with its Headphones app. Plus, you have the option of listening in Sony&#39;s 360 Reality Audio if you&#39;re willing to splurge for the priciest streaming plan on select services (Amazon Music HD, Tidal HiFi, etc.). On-board controls give you the ability to manage music, adjust volume, take calls and activate a voice assistant without reaching for your phone. Lastly, the C500 will give you up to 10 hours of listening time with one additional charge in the included case. A quick-charge feature offers an hour of tunes in 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The WF-C500 is available for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:pre-order" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CFP6J6D/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;language=en_US">pre-order</a> today, but colors vary by retailer.

The price stays the same at $249.99, but the company offers a new design and improved ANC thanks to a Dual Noise Sensor. As the &quot;XB&quot; signifies, this model is equipped with the company&#39;s Extra Bass feature that amps up the low-end tone when activated. DSEE tech makes streaming over Bluetooth a bit more enjoyable by restoring detail lost to compression. The XB910N can also manage Sony&#39;s 360 Reality Audio content and employs Adaptive Sound Control, a staple of the company&#39;s pricier headphones, that can automatically adjust settings based on activity or location.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony is also angling at the remote working crowd here. The company explains that Precise Voice Pickup tech uses a combination of microphones and signal processing to amplify your voice on calls. There&#39;s also &quot;a more natural listening experience&quot; in ambient sound mode as Sony says the XB910N can pick up more of what&#39;s going on around you. That&#39;s handy whether you need to stay tuned in to what&#39;s going on either at home or in the office. On-board controls include Sony&#39;s quick attention feature which lets outside noise in when you place your hand over an earcup and there&#39;s a dedicated button to quickly change from ANC to ambient sound.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony says the XB910N will last up to 30 hours with the option of 4.5 hours of listening time after a 10-minute quick charge. To further cater to travelers, the company opted for soft, oval-shaped earpads for extra cushion and a design that folds flat for easy storage. If you prefer to save even more on your noise-cancelling headphones, the excellent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-sony-wh-ch710n-headphones-announced-price-specs-availability.html">WH-CH710N</a> will stick around and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:are currently $98" href="https://amzn.to/3B70fzT">are currently $98</a>. Although they lack a lot of the handy features from Sony&#39;s other models, the noise-cancelling CH710N are light and comfy, handling the basics very well for that price.</p><p>The WF-C500 is available for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:pre-order" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09CGB6VRR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;language=en_US">pre-order</a> today, and once again, the colors vary by retailer.

The company has <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=23144&amp;mid=">confirmed</a> the Grand Cherokee 4xe will arrive in North American dealers in early 2022, and will sport more capabilities than you might have expected. The estimated 25 miles of all-electric driving (440 miles total) won&#39;t necessarily cover your entire commute, but Jeep is promising a rough-and-ready PHEV that can climb hills without touching the 2.0L turbo gas engine. You can also drive in a full hybrid mode for peak performance and an &quot;eSave&quot; mode to preserve the 17kWh battery for later.</p><p>You can also expect new technology inside, such as 10-inch front and rear passenger displays with built-in Fire TV — your kids can stream Prime Video in the backseat. The driver, meanwhile, gets a 10-inch display with a much faster Uconnect 5 platform that supports over-the-air updates.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The 4xe and its regular counterparts are improved off-roaders with semi-active damping for air suspension as well as a front-axle disconnect when the SUV senses it doesn&#39;t need all-wheel drive. You&#39;ll also get semi-autonomous help through an optional Active Driving Assist system that takes over so long as your hands are on the wheel and your eyes are on the road. Jeep is promising a 6,000lbs maximum towing capacity.</p><p>Jeep hasn&#39;t divulged pricing for the Grand Cherokee 4xe, although it will be available in increasingly loaded Limited, Trailhawk, Overland, Summit and Summit Reserve editions. It&#39;s already safe to say this is an important vehicle for the brand, though. Parent company Stellantis is racing to catch up with rivals in electrifying its vehicles, with plans for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeep-4xe-2025-plan-200527710.html">fully electric version of every SUV</a> by 2025.

With the introduction of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$180 Charge 5" href="https://amzn.to/3AYugBu">$180 Charge 5</a> this year, the company is trying to modernize its most capable band. It’s thinner, lighter and less bulky than the Charge 4 and it now has some features previously reserved for Fitbit’s full-fledged smartwatches, the Versa and Sense.</p><p>That translates to a $30 increase in price, and on top of that, Fitbit’s hoping you’ll pay $10 each month to access your historical health data (and more) through Fitbit Premium. The Charge 5 certainly feels more polished than the Charge 4, but those who prefer bands to smartwatches will find that most core features remain the same — and you’ll have to decide if the perks of Premium are really worth paying for.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design</h2><p>I was surprised by how much of a difference was made by Fitbit updating the design of the Charge 5. It’s 10 percent thinner than the previous version and has new rounded edges, and the module itself is stainless steel in a color that should complement the band choice you picked. It feels less bulky on the wrist and its rounded edges make it so the device doesn’t stick out as much. If you’re wearing the band tightly, the Charge 5 sits more flush against the wrist than the Charge 4 did, so it’s less obtrusive and more comfortable. The strap is also better, too: the Charge 5 comes with a soft-touch band that looks (and hooks) almost like the Apple Watch’s sport bands.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="6d232dd4-2ba0-4dc3-b31d-dd4167737ea9"/><p>The display has been updated as well: it’s a 1.04-inch color AMOLED touchscreen that wakes up when you lift your wrist. It’s leaps and bounds better than the grayscale OLED screen on the Charge 4 and it puts the Charge 5 more in line with Fitbit’s smartwatches.</p><p>It also has a new always-on feature, which you can activate in the settings. It will automatically turn off at night if you have sleep mode turned on, but otherwise, it keeps the clock and watch face on, if slightly dimmed, all day long. This obviously affects battery life and Fitbit makes that clear.</p><p>But with the addition of a touchscreen, Fitbit took all physical buttons off of the Charge 5. You may think the shiny slivers on the long edges of the module are capacitive-touch buttons but they’re not — they’re actually the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-eda-sensors-heart-stress-i-h-130058156.html">electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors</a> that enable stress monitoring. While I didn’t have any problems using the touchscreen, it was a bit weird to not have a button to fall back on because I was used to the inductive side button on the Charge 4.</p><h2>New (and old) features</h2><p>Fitbit trickled down a few advanced features from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-review-eda-stress-blood-oxygen-specs-price-130048259.html">Sense smartwatch</a> to the Charge 5, namely ECG measurements and EDA monitoring. The former is “coming soon,” so I wasn’t able to test it, but the latter is similar to the EDA tool on Fitbit’s smartwatch. Instead of covering the device’s screen with your palm like you would on the Sense, the Charge 5 has two long sensors on its sides that you pinch and hold when you want to take an EDA scan.</p><p>At first, I didn’t know you could change the duration of each scan, so I sat in semi-frustrated silence for three whole minutes (torture, I know). The EDA sensor looks for changes in your skin that may be linked to stress and it’ll report how many differences it captured at the end of the scan. The Charge 5 reported 18 incidents in my first session, which probably reflected my increasing frustration with the tool as I used it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7aa2d9b0-1fb4-11ec-b6ff-0a4d01ae4fea" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Fitbit Charge 5 fitness tracker" data-uuid="db0fb90f-ea72-3370-88c8-581a51385679"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>The device’s screen counts down the remaining time in your scan, but it doesn’t show anything else. Fitbit used to have guided breathing exercises on its devices which would take you through a few minutes of breathwork with the intention of calming you down. Fitbit still has meditation exercises available in its app (most available via Premium, with only a scant few free) but I wish Fitbit had brought over that aspect into its EDA tool on the Charge 5. I never felt significantly more calm after a scan — if anything, pausing during my busy day to have my fitness tracker tell me that I might be stressed, without providing any aid, made me more annoyed than less.</p><p>Otherwise, the Charge 5 is much the same as the Charge 4, although all of its features look a bit more glossy thanks to the full-color screen. The GPS was, arguably, the most important thing about the Charge 4 and it remains solid on the Charge 5. The built-in sensor grabbed my location within seconds of me starting a run and my route was accurately mapped in Fitbit app after I synced.</p><p>But Fitbit didn’t add more music-focused features. In fact, it actually removed some, which is a bummer. The Charge 4 had no onboard storage and only Spotify Premium subscribers could control playback from its screen. According to Fitbit, it’s data showed that customers weren’t using the music controls a lot, so they removed the Spotify option as well. While I understand the logic, I was disappointed each time I ran with the Charge 5 — I would turn to my wrist to skip a track only to immediately realize I had to take my phone out of my fanny pack.</p><p>On a positive note, Fitbit added solid alarm and timer apps on the Charge 5. The device is not designed to have as many onboard programs as a smartwatch, but these are pretty basic and many fitness bands include them. I love being able to set daily alarms so I never forget to take medication, and I inevitably end up setting a timer or two each day to keep track of laundry, cooking food and the like.</p><h2>What you get with Premium</h2><p>Fitbit has been slowly incorporating Premium, its $10-per-month health and fitness service, into all of its devices over the past few years. What that means for the Charge 5 is that some advanced metrics are behind that paywall, along with things like wellness reports, guided workouts, meditations, recipe inspiration and more.</p><p>My biggest problem lies with the walled-off health metrics. It essentially means that Fitbit users can only get the data necessary to up their sleep and exercise game if they pay for it. You may only realize how much of your data you don’t have access to after using the Charge 5 for months, too, which is a bummer (you get six months of Fitbit Premium when you buy a new Charge 5, so at least you’ll get a taste of it).</p><p>For example, Premium gives you access to 30-day and 90-day health trends based on your recorded data, plus “advanced” health insights related to your heart, activity, sleep and more. And Fitbit’s wellness reports, which gathers your recorded information about heart rate, steps, weight, water and food intake, exercise, sleep and more for you to easily give to your doctor, are only available to subscribers.</p><section data-eng-breakout="16cb92944be84298bbf7272c804217de" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7a94cff0-1fb4-11ec-bfff-fff79ac5bf9d" alt="Fitbit Charge 5 fitness tracker" data-uuid="e072e3eb-b801-3314-8ce6-54948bb7febb"></section><p>A new feature only available to Premium subscribers is what Fitbit calls a Daily Readiness Score. It basically tells you how ready your body is to work out any given day based on things like heart rate variability, sleep and fitness fatigue. This sounds similar to Garmin’s Body Battery score (which, by the way, doesn’t cost anything extra).</p><p>However, I couldn’t test this out because it’s “coming soon” just like the ECG app I mentioned earlier. Fitbit has hyped up its new products with coming-soon features for years, with at least a few of them taking forever to actually arrive. It should go without saying, but I wouldn’t recommend buying a Fitbit device for any yet-to-be-released features — it may take months for them to actually arrive.</p><p>This isn’t a Fitbit Premium review — I haven’t gathered enough data with the Charge 5 to get the most out of the service, and that can only be done by spending at least a few weeks to a few months with it. But I will say that Premium really isn’t for someone like me who already has a fitness system in place and already tries to eat as healthily as possible (most of the time). But it may be useful for those just getting started on their fitness journey, whether that means they’re trying to lose weight, exercise more regularly or eat better. Premium’s video workouts and recipe inspirations aren’t particularly special (I guarantee you’ve seen similar one-minute recipe videos on Instagram), but having them all in one place encourages you to use them on a daily basis. A common idea in the fitness world is that the hardest part of working out is actually showing up to do it. That can translate to many parts of someone’s health journey — Fitbit’s Premium service removes a lot of the guesswork that can make living healthier seem inconvenient.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>Fitbit promises up to seven days of life on the Charge 5, but that estimate drops to two days when you have the screen in always-on mode. Thankfully, Fitbit’s estimates were mostly correct — I got about two and half days with always-on mode enabled and five with it disabled. Just keep in mind that how often you use the built-in GPS will affect battery life, too. During my time with the device, I used the GPS almost every other day for 45 minutes to one hour during my runs.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>It’s hard to compare the Fitbit Charge 5 to other fitness trackers because there aren’t many at the $180 price point. Most simple band-style trackers are more affordable, like the $80 Garmin Vivofit 4 or the $130 Vivosmart 4, while smartwatches like the $200 Garmin Forerunner 55 dominate the higher end. Arguably the most comparable device out of those is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Vivosmart 4" href="https://fave.co/39sQGih">Vivosmart 4</a>, which has a thinner design but a less exciting, grayscale OLED screen. It also only has connected GPS, not onboard, but it does have features like all-day activity monitoring, workout tracking, VO2 max measurements, Body Battery scores, sleep and blood oxygen tracking and more. It also <em>does</em> have music controls directly on the device and a similarly long battery life.</p><p>And when it comes to Fitbit’s own lineup, the Charge 5 shares a lot of features with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:$150 Luxe" href="https://bit.ly/36rcNnW">$150 Luxe</a>. Sure, the latter is thinner and targeted more towards those who want a bracelet-like wearable, but it’s more affordable and has a full-color display (which will soon support always-on mode), activity and sleep tracking, smartphone alerts, and more. What it doesn’t have is onboard GPS and Fitbit Pay.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>When you’re talking about $180 for the Charge 5, it’s tempting to say “just get a smartwatch instead.” You could get a capable <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Garmin smartwatch" href="https://fave.co/3CIT6FZ">Garmin smartwatch</a> for only $20 more than that, or even an Apple Watch Series 3 (although I wouldn’t recommend the latter). But one of the reasons many will consider the Charge 5 is its band style — some people just prefer that to larger smartwatches. In general, fitness bands have lower profiles, multi-day battery life and they typically keep fitness at the forefront. If that sounds like what you’re looking for in a wearable, the Charge 5 is a breath of fresh air.</p><p>But considering its biggest perks are onboard GPS and Fitbit Pay support with NFC, the Charge 5 remains pretty similar to the Charge 4. It’s also disappointing that Fitbit didn’t really <em>fix</em> much about the previous band other than its dated design. You still have a limited selection of apps on the Charge 5, it doesn’t integrate with Apple Health or Google Fit and Fitbit removed all music control functionality, even for Spotify Premium users. I’d expect more progress and differentiation in a device that now costs $30 more. You could safely skip this update if your Charge 4 is still serving you well. But if you don’t have a fitness tracker right now, the Charge 5 remains one of your best options if you’re looking for a capable band with built-in GPS.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-review-130043489.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1142c649-183f-4abe-8036-1d0d24d5c7a5</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 13:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632862328</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T20:52:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7aa23d70-1fb4-11ec-ae32-4a7ac16d5232" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7aa23d70-1fb4-11ec-ae32-4a7ac16d5232" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fitbit Charge 5 fitness tracker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fitbit Charge 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valve is reportedly working on a standalone VR headset]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Brad Lynch, a YouTube host who reports on virtual reality, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp42lQYVzwo">found</a> evidence from patent applications and other sources that Valve is currently working on a standalone VR headset codenamed &quot;Deckard.&quot; <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/a-new-standalone-valve-vr-headset-teased-by-deep-steamvr-file-dive/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> has independently confirmed that the company is indeed developing a device with that codename.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Lynch found references to multiple iterations of Deckard, including a &quot;proof of concept&quot; in June. Valve is apparently planning to give it the ability to bring up two SteamVR menu options: prism and standalone system layer. The latter, as you may have guessed, implies that the device could work on its own without the need to be tethered to a PC. If you&#39;ll recall, Valve&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html">Index VR headset</a> released in 2019 has to be attached to a computer to work. The YouTube host also discovered a mention of Deckard in a SteamVR Linux ARM binary. That particular evidence hints at processing power built into a Valve VR headset, further solidifying the possibility that it&#39;s a standalone device.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to<em> Ars Technica&#39;s </em>sources, Valve was developing two design concepts for a virtual reality headset. One of them ended up resembling the Index in that it needs to connect to a PC and to SteamVR Tracking Boxes. The other ended up being designed around a built-in processor with inside-out tracking like the Oculus Quest. Those sources also hinted that Valve had to bring in an outside firm to develop inside-out tracking that could match what the Quest can do.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether the standalone VR headset will ever be released remains to be seen. As the publication notes, Valve is already preparing to start shipping the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html">Steam Deck</a> in December. With the current chip shortage affecting the tech and auto industries today, we may have to wait quite a bit for Deckard if Valve decides to release it at all.</p><div id="2cab72202c95443eb59e8628c4483f03"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp42lQYVzwo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valve-standalone-vr-headset-report-120909267.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f645a2ba-6fb4-479f-90cf-feaaa62f9ba4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 12:09:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632917384</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T12:09:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5f5bbf30-2119-11ec-b7ff-71553085a9ff" width="1600" height="923" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5f5bbf30-2119-11ec-b7ff-71553085a9ff" width="1600" height="923" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Valve]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Valve]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Amazon reveals its periscope-equipped Alexa robot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon’s annual barrage of new Echo hardware didn’t disappoint, ranging from role-playing games to nutrition tracking, drones and videocall devices for kids.

Hopefully, all those delays have ensured <em>New World</em> arrives with its best foot forward.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-new-world-now-available-155441505.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><h3></h3><h3>The biggest news stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amp/bloodystealer-trojan-targets-gamers-steam-gog-and-epic-accounts-105027673.html"><ins>BloodyStealer trojan targets Steam, GOG and Epic accounts</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-jelly-scrolling-problem-response-073027688.html"><ins>Apple says the iPad mini&#39;s &#39;jelly scrolling&#39; problem is normal</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-keys-mini-keyboard-070128945.html"><ins>Logitech&#39;s MX Keys Mini is a compact keyboard for minimalists</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fastmail-1password-masked-email-110028257.html"><ins>1Password can now randomly generate email addresses for logins</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-2-africa-longest-subsea-cable-in-the-world-070058568.html"><ins>Facebook&#39;s 2Africa to become the longest subsea cable in the world</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-s-dolby-vision-123057086.html"><ins>Xbox Series X/S consoles now support Dolby Vision for gaming</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iwork-keynote-pages-numbers-live-video-182213376.html"><ins>Apple beefs up Keynote, Pages and Numbers with new features</ins></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-amazon-reveals-its-periscope-equipped-alexa-robot-111507256.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ec32c5d-64e9-4c2d-861d-06af631304ef</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 11:15:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632913305</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T11:01:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0e506341-2112-11ec-abb3-79187d3c8a29" width="675" height="419" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0e506341-2112-11ec-abb3-79187d3c8a29" width="675" height="419" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Morning After]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The Morning After]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's biggest innovation is being cheap]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As Amazon’s executives <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021">took the stage one after another yesterday</a> to introduce the world to the company’s “next big leaps forward,” a sense of deja vu crept up on me. It only grew stronger as <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-devices-services-news-september-2021">the event</a> progressed, with many new Amazon products seeming incredibly familiar. The company has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peak-design-amazon-video-175235085.html">criticized in the past</a> for borrowing designs of popular goods and selling them for a lot cheaper.</p><p>That’s not an uncommon practice of course — massive retailers all over America like Walmart and Costco have offered lower-cost store-brand lines forever. But none of them stage flashy keynotes to tout their products as “innovations.” While Amazon has indeed brought certain unique technologies to the world in the past, this year the company’s “innovations” seemed to be more of it doing what it does best: undercutting the rest.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Halo View: Twinning with Fitbit</h2><p>With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-view-price-163738227.html">the Halo View</a>, Amazon is essentially adding a display to its existing screenless health-tracking band. But the View’s shape and style are so similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-eda-sensors-heart-stress-i-h-130058156.html">Fitbit’s Charge series</a> it’s hard to differentiate the two. Sure, there are only so many ways you can stick a rectangular display on a wristband, but Amazon’s mimicry doesn’t stop there. It also introduced new Halo Fitness and Halo Nutrition services today that will offer guides on working out and eating better.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/50269ed0-207a-11ec-b5f7-3e575d322de7" alt="Amazon Halo View" data-uuid="1880500c-375f-3ee2-8ffa-5f360311fa39"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>That’s basically Fitbit Premium, which offers guides on working out and eating better. Oh and Fitbit’s $10-a-month service also provides tips on meditating and sleep. Amazon’s subscription costs just $4 per month after a trial period, though, and the $80 Halo View is $100 cheaper than the new Charge 5. The View probably won’t do as much as Fitbit’s trackers, which are quite sophisticated. Still, considering the price, Amazon will likely sell a lot of them.</p><h2>Amazon Smart Thermostat: Lose the frills for a fraction of the price</h2><p>Amazon teamed up with existing thermostat brand Honeywell to make a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-60-dollar-alexa-powered-thermostat-161738943.html">Smart Thermostat</a> that will work with most existing 24V HVACs (most common for residential HVAC systems). You can control it with a separate Alexa-enabled device and set custom routines for heating and cooling. The company hasn’t released much more information about its thermostat yet, but from what we can see, the device has the rounded-rectangle shape of an ecobee smart thermostat with the color scheme of a Google Nest product.</p><p>Lots of existing smart thermostats by brands like ecobee, Sensibo and Google’s Nest do more things, but Amazon is seriously undercutting the competition by selling its version for just $60. The Nest Thermostat that was launched last year costs $130, while an <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostats/smart-wifi-thermostat/">ecobee 3 Lite goes for $170</a>.</p><h2>Blink cameras: Competing with Google for much cheaper</h2><p>Competition in the security camera space is pretty stiff, so it isn’t very surprising that Amazon and Google both borrow a lot from each other. Amazon unveiled a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-blink-video-doorbell-floodlight-camera-170141201.html">new $50 Blink video doorbell camera</a> today, alongside a set of outdoor cameras. One of these is the $40 floodlight camera mount that calls to mind <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-doorbell-camera-battery-powered-floodlight-130016075.html">Google’s Nest Cam with integrated floodlight</a>. To be fair, though, Google did only introduce a wireless, battery-powered doorbell camera after Blink, so it appears the borrowing is mutual here.</p><p>The difference, however, is once again in pricing. Blink’s video doorbell is less than a third of the price of the $180 Nest Doorbell. Google’s floodlight-cum-security camera is $280, while Amazon’s mount (with a camera) is <em>half</em> that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094YXVVRF">at $140</a>.</p><h2>But at what cost?</h2><p>It’s no secret that Amazon’s business model has a lot to do with knowing what people want and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-price-changes-2018-8">changing their prices accordingly</a>. But how can it <a href="https://www.thelist.com/412459/the-real-reason-amazon-essentials-products-are-so-cheap/">make things so cheap</a>? In addition to pure economies of scale and multiple reports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/magazine/amazon-workers-employees-covid-19.html">questionable (at best) labor practices</a>, the company also offers goods at reduced prices in exchange for sticking ads on your devices. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx1YQ0NCUZZMIZF/">ad-supported versions of Kindles</a> and Fire tablets often go for $20 to $30 less than their stock counterparts.</p><p>With the breadth of devices Amazon offers, too, the sheer amount of data it could collect purely for the sake of selling you stuff is huge. With the smart thermostat, it could detect a dip in temperature in your region and suggest you buy from its in-house brand of winter wear. Or maybe your child’s been reading a book on a Kindle, and the company later serves ads for collectibles from that title on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-glow-announcement-164412809.html">new kid-centric Glow video-calling device</a>. Or how about a subsidized version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">the Astro robot</a> that roams your house or follows you around with an ad on its face? Amazon also talked about a “vision of ambient intelligence” — which sounds very similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yexspE0prM">concept of “ambient computing”</a> expounded <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-15-google-nest-smart-home-fix-plan.html">by Google for years</a>. But because Amazon’s products are so much cheaper, it could succeed at stuffing Alexa in so many more places in our lives.</p><p>Plus, with all the data it’s gathering from your shopping habits, whether it’s on one of its devices or the Amazon app, the company can afford to sell you something at a lower profit margin. The company said in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ">its privacy notice that</a> it’s “not in the business of selling our customers&#39; personal information to others.” But it’s presumably using that data to understand the types of things you’re more likely to buy and put that stuff in front of you. It’ll probably make more off of you in the long run if you’re using the cheap Fire tablet to browse its store.</p><p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that <em>everything</em> Amazon unveiled today was a cutrate version of something else. We got an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-always-home-cam-beta-test-invite-only-163911030.html">update on the Ring Always Home Cam</a>, which was first announced last year. You’ll soon be able to sign up to test it out. The home security device is a little drone that can fly around your property at your command to see if anything’s amiss. No mainstream tech giant has launched something similar yet, though, so Amazon isn’t undercutting anyone on this.</p><p>Still, it seems like the company’s strategy for its flagship products is similar to that of its Basics line: Take a good idea, tweak it and sell it for loads cheaper. It’s not terrible; We could always use affordable, reliable devices. But Amazon is not innovating: It’s the Costco of consumer tech.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon’s fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-price-competition-innovation-110007043.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3f7846b-4698-4543-92cc-b69b146e3ec2</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 11:00:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632918559</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T12:29:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f4ca6e90-20a6-11ec-bbdf-b4e6750dab9d" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f4ca6e90-20a6-11ec-bbdf-b4e6750dab9d" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Devices and Services Fall 2021: A grid of thumbnails showing (clockwise from top left): the Amazon Glow, Astro robot, Smart Thermostat, Blink cameras, Ring security drone, Echo Show 15, Echo Show in a Mickey Mouse holder and Halo View band.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Devices and Services Fall 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SanDisk memory cards are discounted for today only on Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s Deal of the Day is all about storage products, with particularly good prices for SD cards.

The model in question provides up to 120MB/s speeds, essentially the max available in the UHS-I format. With A1 application class performance, it delivers fewer IOPS (input-output access per second) than A2 class cards, but sustained sequential read speeds are the same. It has a high 4.8 out of 5 consumer rating on Amazon with 89,144 global reviews.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/aad46030-2109-11ec-bc37-ab2d3c3635f9" alt="SanDisk CFexpress Extreme Pro memory card" data-uuid="5a3ae9c4-943c-38f5-aed5-f55461e31875"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon also has a great deal today on another type of memory card that&#39;s difficult to find discounted. It&#39;s offering the SanDisk Extreme Pro 256GB CFexpress Type B memory card at $260, which is $140 off the regular $400 price. These cards are used in cameras like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797.html">Canon&#39;s EOS R5</a>, Nikon&#39;s Z6 II, Z7 II, D6 and 1DX Mark III, Panasonic&#39;s S1, S1R and S1H models, and the Blackmagic Design BMPCC 6K and 6K Pro.
