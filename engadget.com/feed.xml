The company is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5VtfD2i3rc">livestreaming</a> PlayStation Showcase 2021 at 4PM Eastern, and you can watch the whole event below. It won&#39;t be a short presentation — Sony said the Showcase will clock in at about 40 minutes, with an after-show providing updates from featured studios.</p><p>The stream will officially focus on upcoming PS5 games (including for the holidays) from both PlayStation Studios as well as third-party developers. However, we also wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Sony devotes some time to system updates for the console. The company has teased a number of significant OS improvements as part of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ps5-ssd-upgrade-beta-software-130741800.html">beta program</a>, including the option to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">add SSD storage</a>. This is Sony&#39;s big chance to set its agenda for the next year, and it might not limit that agenda to the console&#39;s game lineup.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="305cb89cba704160a1e6d72c74899f82"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T5VtfD2i3rc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/watch-playstation-showcase-2021-ps5-190033820.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16ac946c-6b1d-40ba-8f5b-15236ada814b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 19:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631196167</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T14:02:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/82f3d290-efad-11eb-b7cf-146d0ea6045c" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/82f3d290-efad-11eb-b7cf-146d0ea6045c" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aaron Souppouris/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5 with Xbox consoles in background]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5 with Xbox consoles in background]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The largest direct carbon capture plant is now making a small impact on emissions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The world&#39;s largest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-11-robot-trees-co2-into-concrete-climate-change.html">direct-air carbon capture</a> plant is up and running, although you might want to keep your expectations in check. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-09-08/inside-the-world-s-largest-direct-carbon-capture-plant">reports</a> Climeworks has <a href="https://climeworks.com/news/climeworks-launches-orca">started</a> operations for Orca, a plant in Iceland that grabs CO2 from the air, storing it underground and using a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-10-carbfix-iceland-power-plant.html">Carbfix</a> solution to mix the chemical with water and (in two years) trap it in stone. The facility will capture 4,000 tons of CO2 per year, and it&#39;s &#39;permanently&#39; removed from the environment, not recycled.</p><p>A carbon offset isn&#39;t a trivial purchase. It currently costs $600 per ton for bulk requests, and as high as $1,200 for eco-friendly individuals. Climeworks hopes to shrink the cost to $300 or less per ton by 2030 as it ramps up its overall capacity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Orca represents an important milestone for actively reducing humanity&#39;s carbon footprint, it&#39;s not much to brag about at this stage — if anything, it reveals just how far the technology has to go. That 4,000 tons of capture is equal to just 250 US residents, half the total capture output in the world, and nowhere near matching Climeworks&#39; initial plan to capture 300 million tons (1 percent of the world&#39;s emissions) by 2025. The company now expects to reach 500,000 tons per year by 2030.</p><p>There are still reasons to be optimistic. Demand is very high, according to Climeworks, to the point where the company plans to expand Orca tenfold in the next three years. Lower carbon reduction prices could also accelerate adoption by tempting companies that would otherwise pay penalties when they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-21-years-behind-emissions-goals-enel-study-180121943.html">can&#39;t meet emissions targets</a>. This won&#39;t be a true substitute for reducing CO2 output, but it could help mitigate the impact in the short term.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/worlds-largest-carbon-capture-plant-185556109.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb954aa9-b2fd-443f-bf8b-b97d42f05e69</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 18:55:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631213760</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T18:56:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Basic Materials Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2b974d80-1198-11ec-9bfc-8ba21f637771" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2b974d80-1198-11ec-9bfc-8ba21f637771" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Climeworks]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Climeworks Orca carbon capture plant in Iceland]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Climeworks Orca carbon capture plant in Iceland]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM extends Bolt EV factory shutdown amid battery pack shortage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>General Motors can’t seem to catch a break. One week after the automaker announced it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-halts-car-production-chip-shortages-200334864.html"><ins>suspending production</ins></a> at all but four of its North American manufacturing facilities, it said it plans to extend the shutdown of its Orion assembly plant by two weeks. The facility is where the company makes its Chevy Bolt electric vehicles. It was one of the assembly plants GM shut down last week — though it did so because of the recent Bolt <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-bolt-evs-once-again-over-fire-risks-154033780.html"><ins>recall</ins></a>, not the chip shortage that affected its other factories.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-extends-michigan-plant-shutdown-over-bolt-ev-recall-2021-09-09/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, GM expects the shutdown to continue until at least September 24th. The company blamed battery pack shortages for the extended halt to production. GM added it won’t resume Bolt manufacturing or sales until it’s sure it has addressed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-fire-warning-215322969.html"><ins>fire concerns</ins></a> that forced it to recall the vehicle in the first place.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s the latest setback in a series of setbacks for GM when it comes to the Bolt. The automaker initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-chevy-bolt-over-battery-fire-reports-230044311.html"><ins>recalled more than 68,000 cars</ins></a> last November after five reports of battery fires between 2017 and 2019. After two Bolt EVs included in the company’s 2020 recall caught fire recently, GM issued a second recall. It then widened that action to include more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-expands-fire-risk-recall-all-chevy-bolt-115934063.html"><ins>140,000 vehicles globally</ins></a>.

To that end, the search giant says it will use freshwater alternatives to cool its server farms. In places like Douglas County, Georgia, the company already uses reclaimed wastewater to keep its servers running. Moving forward, it will work to double down on that practice by finding more opportunities to use wastewater and seawater.</p><p>At its offices, meanwhile, the company plans to use more on-site water sources, such as collected stormwater, for things like landscape irrigation and toilet flushing that don&#39;t require potable water. Google points to its Bay Area campuses and a <a href="https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/2018-ecology-book.pdf">landscaping project</a> where it worked with local ecologists as an example of an initiative where it&#39;s already thinking about its water use.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Our water stewardship journey will involve continuously enhancing our water use and consumption,&quot; said Google sustainability officer Kate Brandt in a <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/replenishing-water/">blog post</a>.</p><p>In its efforts to replenish more water than it consumes, the company says it will also invest in community projects working to address local water and watershed challenges in places where the company has data centers and offices. As an example of the work Google plans to do here, the company points to a partnership it already has in place with the <a href="https://www.crit-nsn.gov/">Colorado River Indian Tribes</a> to reduce the amount of water removed from Lake Mead. The reservoir, the largest in the US, faces a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/16/lake-mead-drought-reservoir-water-level-cuts">pressing water shortage</a> due to a combination of overuse and extended drought.</p><p>Lastly, the company plans to continue working with communities, policymakers and planners to help them with tools and technologies they need to measure and predict water availability and needs. Here, the company references work it did with the United Nations Environment Programme to create the <a href="https://www.sdg661.app/">Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer</a>. It&#39;s a tool that tracks national and local surface water changes over time.</p><p>Today&#39;s commitment comes after Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-carbon-free-energy-2030-190100260.html">announced</a> the company would attempt to run all of its data centers and offices entirely on carbon-free energy by 2030. Pichai described the effort as a &quot;moonshot,&quot; noting it would be tricky in some instances to achieve due to the remote location of some of Google&#39;s facilities.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-water-stewardship-pledge-2030-171248761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43c95bef-8b4d-4bec-a57d-8f1581aeb0a0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 17:12:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631207572</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T17:13:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Water Resources]]></category><category><![CDATA[Natural Resources]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/47c0b590-118f-11ec-beaf-3766a773e7c9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/47c0b590-118f-11ec-beaf-3766a773e7c9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google data center]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google data center]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Teams is getting hybrid meeting features, including CarPlay support]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/covid-19"><ins>COVID-19</ins></a> pandemic caused a huge shift toward remote working, though many people are still eager to return to the office.

The online shopping giant has <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/amazon-to-pay-full-college-tuition-for-front-line-employees">pledged</a> to pay full college tuition for its operations (effectively, warehouse) workers in the US beginning in January. The company didn&#39;t reveal the full criteria required, but some staff are eligible if they&#39;ve been with Amazon for just three months.</p><p>The firm will also cover high school diplomas, GEDs and English as a Second Language certifications. And no, workers won&#39;t have to wait until they&#39;ve finished a semester to get compensation. Amazon said it would pay tuition and other fees in advance, and would offer annual funds as long as people remain employees.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Staff will also have access to a trio of new &quot;tuition-free&quot; skill programs that will help train for positions in Amazon Web Services, IT support (such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-robots-motion-capture-worker-safety-164711965.html">Amazon Robotics</a>) and user experience design. Not surprisingly, Amazon is using pay as an incentive — those on the IT track can make another $10,000 per year, the company claimed.</p><p>The incentives for Amazon are clear. This will help it not only recruit more workers for its office roles, but attract and retain workers who were either wary of working for Amazon or want assurances of upward career mobility once their schooling is done. Amazon might lose some of those tuition recipients to other companies, but that could be a small price to pay if it leads to more internal candidates and a more stable workforce.</p><p>This won&#39;t satisfy many of Amazon&#39;s critics. Politicians and labor rights activists have blasted Amazon over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-california-warehouse-worker-quotas-bill-191234363.html">tough workplace quotas</a>, constant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-warehouse-policies-020626313.html">employee monitoring</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-automated-injuries-211813202.html">higher injury rates</a> at automated facilities, among other issues. There are also allegations Amazon has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-retail-union-rwdsu-23-objections-election-tampering-allegation-143104913.html">interfered with unionization votes</a> that could improve conditions and pay. Free education while you work is only useful so long as you&#39;re happy with the work itself, and this plan won&#39;t change much.</p><p>There&#39;s also the question of Amazon&#39;s outsized influence. The company said it was the &quot;largest job creator&quot; in the US, with 400,000 people having joined since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Paid tuition could give Amazon influence much like that of the military, where people sometimes sign up to defray education costs. As welcome as many might find the gesture, it could give Amazon more clout in society than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ftc-chair-lina-khan-recusal-antitrust-investigations-181556108.html">regulators might like</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-to-pay-college-tuition-warehouse-worker-163326286.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">de06cec2-34f8-4d73-ac2b-76218b29db2a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 16:33:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631204915</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T16:28:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/c7afb1f0-3415-11eb-bff7-93bacb6e4452" width="3793" height="2529" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/c7afb1f0-3415-11eb-bff7-93bacb6e4452" width="3793" height="2529" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An employee scans packages at Amazon's JFK8 distribution center in Staten Island, New York, U.S. November 25, 2020.

I might actually kind of like them, and I suspect others will too. Yet there are many valid reasons why you’d want to avoid ceding yet another surface of your life — much less your face — to Facebook. As with everything Facebook, it comes down to privacy and whether or not you trust the company (it doesn’t help that Ray-Ban Stories’ privacy settings leave a lot to be desired.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But, purely as a set of “smart glasses,” they offer a pretty intriguing look at what non-AR “smart glasses” can be.</p><h2>Ray-Ban Stories</h2><p>I’ve spent quite a bit of time with the first three versions of Snapchat’s Spectacles, and Facebook has undoubtedly benefited from watching Snap experiment with sunglasses over the last five years. Even the name, <em>Ray-Ban Stories</em>, feels like some kind of subtweet at Evan Spiegel.</p><p>But while Spectacles always felt a little conspicuous and toy-like, these mostly look and feel like, well, a pair of Ray-Bans. Yes, they are a bit heavier, and the cameras are difficult to ignore; but from a distance, they could easily pass as any other pair of WayFarers. That’s a good thing for Facebook. Ray-Bans might not be for everyone, but they are certainly more appealing — and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html">influencer-friendly</a> — than anything with a Facebook logo (there is Facebook branding on the packaging).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f3708120-1182-11ec-97db-63bac4acede5" alt="Facebook Ray-ban Stories." data-uuid="4c699013-6ee2-303f-b077-29fade041994"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Karissa Bell</div></figure><p>Besides the look, one major difference between Ray-Ban Stories and Spectacles is that the Ray-Ban glasses also have audio capabilities built in. Each arm has a tiny speaker so you can stream music or podcasts, while being able to hear your surroundings. Much like the Bose Frames, it essentially turns the glasses into bluetooth headphones (there are also onboard mics so you can pick up calls). Though the audio functionality is more of a secondary feature, so far it’s been my favorite part of wearing the glasses.</p><p>The open-ear speakers means you get much more ambient sound than you do with say, AirPods Pro in transparency mode, so going for a walk while listening to music feels pretty natural. But I’ve also been pleasantly surprised with the audio quality, which is much better than I expected.</p><p>Music sounds rich, and calls and podcasts are clear — at least when you listen at about mid-range volume. The audio quality degrades significantly if you crank the volume to full blast, but that also kills the whole letting-ambient-noise-in thing. They aren’t the same as a decent pair of earbuds, but I’d have no hesitation about wearing these in place of my normal AirPods for a quick run or stroll around the park (they aren’t water resistant so I’d probably leave them at home on longer runs when sweat could be more of an issue).</p><h2>The cameras (and yet another Facebook app)</h2><p>But the main reason why Facebook and Luxottica want you to spend $300+ is for the cameras. Facebook says it crammed a lot of processing power into the 5-megapixel cameras to help them punch above their weight and it mostly works. The videos I shot had good stabilization even when I was walking or in a moving car. The photos were considerably less impressive, but passable if all you’re looking for is something to share to your Instagram Story.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, they seemed to shoot better in bright light — the photos I took in direct sun were much more clear than those I took on a slightly more overcast day. In slightly more shady conditions, everything looked a bit dark and underexposed. But these are sunglasses, after all, so it makes sense they’d be optimized for sunnier days.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="05274c39-44f5-47ab-9705-9105af25773e"/><p>Viewing and sharing your photos and videos requires a separate app, called Facebook View. The app, which requires a Facebook login, allows you to view your shots and make some basic edits before downloading them to your phone or sharing to another app.</p><p>For now, the app feels a bit overlooked compared with the glasses. There are some barebones editing controls for adjusting the crop, brightness, saturation and a few other elements. The cameras don&#39;t actually shoot 3D photos, but  you can use the app to add some depth effects that add a bit of motion to the shot, similar to how you can share <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-28-facebook-converts-3d-photos-without-portrait-mode.html">“3D photo”</a> in News Feed. There’s also an option to make a video collage, set to a preset soundtrack, with up to 10 clips at a time.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="3963bc8d-8c04-4254-b4d5-33864b476431"/><p>While I appreciated the ability to do a bit of fine-tuning, the effects are limited and so cheesy I briefly wondered if Facebook and Luxottica were hoping to market the glasses to Boomers rather than Gen Z. But, purely as an app for dumping photos, Facebook View gets the job done — and you can always edit your shots in a separate app.</p><p>My other major complaint was with the voice commands, which allows you to shoot photos and videos hands-free. It worked fine the few times I tried it, but I mostly steered clear of the feature. I feel goofy enough talking to any digital assistant outside of my home, but there’s something deeply uncomfortable about saying “Hey Facebook, take a photo,” in public.</p><h2>Privacy</h2><p>Which brings us to the elephant in the room: privacy. Facebook’s official line is that Ray-Ban stories were designed with “privacy in mind” but we all know the company has a pretty dismal track record when it comes to privacy.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about Ray-Ban Stories and privacy:</p><p>There are no ads in the Facebook View app, and Facebook says it won’t use the contents of your photos and videos for advertising purposes. But, as is so often the case with Facebook, merely using the product can inform the company’s ability to “personalize” your experience, according to a disclaimer when you first set up the Facebook View app. “We use this data to improve and personalize your experience with facebook products,” it says. You can opt out of this data sharing, but it’s on by default.</p><p>And remember those hated voice commands? Facebook also stores those transcripts by default, according to the app. The transcripts and “related data” are stored and accessible by “trained reviewers.” And, as with other voice-activated assistants, there will inevitably be occasions when something is captured even when the wake word (in this case “hey Facebook) isn’t uttered. I’ve only intentionally used voice commands twice, and yet there are already four transcripts saved in the app.</p><p>Thankfully, you can opt out of both storing transcripts and sharing “additional” info with facebook. The app also lets you delete transcripts of voice commands it’s captured, but both are unfortunately enabled by default.</p><p>If any of that makes you uneasy, then you’ll likely want to steer clear of not just Ray-Ban Stories but the eventual AR glasses that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/next-generation-wearables-privacy-191237188.html">come next</a>. There’s also the price. At a starting price of $299, they are considerably more expensive than a standard pair of WayFarers, though they’re still less than Ray-Ban’s priciest frames. (And nearly $100 less than the starting price of Snapchat’s third-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-snap-spectacles-3-review-price-specs-availability-ar-filters-dual-camera.html">Spectacles</a>.)</p><p>Whether or not you’re willing to make that investment largely depends on how you feel about Facebook and what you are hoping to get out of a pair of “smart glasses.” At best, they feel like a better, more polished version of Snapchat&#39;s Spectacles. It’s still a novelty, but with decent audio, smart glasses are starting to feel a lot more useful. At worst, the glasses are yet another reminder of Facebook&#39;s dominance.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-hands-on-160048150.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">219cc05c-252c-45f7-8c58-1586279f5abd</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 16:00:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631203200</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T16:00:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a3029980-1182-11ec-bddd-e0da5f9d4976" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a3029980-1182-11ec-bddd-e0da5f9d4976" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Karissa Bell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ray-Ban Stories.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[RB Stories]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook's first smart glasses are the Ray-Ban Stories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook&#39;s first foray into the world of smart glasses is here. Confusingly dubbed Ray-Ban Stories, they start at $299 and bring together much of the technology we&#39;ve already seen in smart eyewear. They&#39;ll let you take first-person photos and videos on the go, like Snap&#39;s Spectacles. And, similar to Bose and Amazon&#39;s speaker-equipped glasses, you&#39;ll be able to listen to media, as well as take calls.</p><p>But what&#39;s most impressive is that Facebook and Ray-Ban owner Luxottica have crammed the hardware components into frames that look and feel almost exactly like a pair of typical designer glasses. The only difference is that the pair of cameras mounted along the corners.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>[Be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-hands-on-160048150.html"><strong>deeper hands-on</strong> with the Ray-Ban Stories</a>!]&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="15472cb6-ca93-4639-b02e-229bbd62ae01"/><p>The Ray-Ban Stories in the iconic Wayfarer style — those chunky &#39;50s-era frames that still look fashionable today — weigh just five grams more than the standard version. And that&#39;s including its dual 5-megapixel cameras, Snapdragon processor, touchpad, speakers, three-microphone array and other hardware. I&#39;ll be honest, I was a bit shocked when I learned how much they weighed. We&#39;re used to smart glasses being thick and heavy, even when they&#39;re coming from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-02-bose-frames-review.html">major brands like Bose</a>. The Ray-Ban Stories look, well, normal.</p><p>I suppose that shouldn&#39;t be too surprising, though, as both Facebook and Ray-Ban ultimately want to normalize smart frames to the point where they&#39;re as common as wireless earbuds. That also helps the companies avoid the mistake Google made with Glass: Those things looked so alien and Borg-like that they were almost instantly reviled.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c82a4df0-1134-11ec-96ff-4bba427d2688" alt="Ray-Ban Stories" data-uuid="632536af-51b8-3d75-b7d1-720900cfdbdd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ray-Ban and Facebook</div></figure><p>Privacy remains a concern with all smart glasses, though. The Ray-Ban Stories have a bright LED that lights up when you&#39;re taking photos and video, but I could see many people taking issue with the subtle camera placement. We&#39;re all used to people capturing everything with their smartphones these days, but doing so still requires more effort than tapping your glasses or issuing a voice command to an all-seeing social network.&nbsp;</p><p>If Facebook can successfully deliver the first smart glasses that don&#39;t make the wearer feel like a joke, and which the general public doesn&#39;t want to throw in a fire, it could gain a serious foothold in the augmented reality market. And, well, we know how much Mark Zuckerberg wants to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-smart-glasses-100518155.html">transform it into a &quot;metaverse company.&quot;</a>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the Wayfarer style, Ray-Ban Stories will be available in the brand&#39;s Round and Meteor frames, five different colors, and your typical array of lenses: Clear, sun, prescription, transition and polarized. I&#39;m surprised Ray-Ban isn&#39;t offering polarized sunglass lenses by default though, which can reduce glare far better than lenses that are just tinted dark. As for battery life, Facebook claims the Ray-Ban Stories will last for around a day of use (around three hours of audio streaming), while the bundled charging case adds another three days of use.</p><p>As ambitious as they may seem, Ray-Ban Stories are also yet another example of how Facebook seemingly can&#39;t help but imitate Snapchat, which has been dabbling in smart glasses since 2016. Even their name hearkens back to the social story format that Snap kicked off and was later copied by Facebook, Instagram and pretty much every other social media outfit. But at this point, I don&#39;t think Facebook cares if everyone calls them copycats if it ultimately leads to more engagement.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9b351580-1186-11ec-beaf-26b290bf92c8" alt="Ray-Ban Stories Samples" data-uuid="0b12a607-26ba-332d-9ae1-2fb3024fca41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p></p><p>After testing out the Ray-Ban Stories for a few days, I found them far more compelling than any smart glasses today. They don&#39;t look as goofy as the Snap Spectacles, and they&#39;re far more comfortable to wear than Bose and Amazon&#39;s Frames. I could only use the Stories in limited situations though, since I need prescription lenses to actually see well.</p><div id="d1cc4a2f7d5e45258dd94a254124bfe1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Video quality is surprisingly good, very stable even when I’m moving around.

I was less impressed with the Stories&#39; photo quality, but I suppose it could be useful if you wanted to take a pic without pulling out your phone. You can import your photos and videos from the smart glasses into Facebook View, a new app that lets you quickly edit your media and share it to practically every social media site (yes, even Snapchat!).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9b3f4eb0-1186-11ec-ab7b-42bfd4cccb18" alt="Ray-Ban Stories Samples" data-uuid="1b0f46dd-aa1b-3ac9-bfec-34f7fb15d024"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>While I didn&#39;t expect much when it comes to audio playback, the Stories surprised me with sound that was good enough for listening to light tunes or podcasts. I could see them being particularly useful while jogging or biking outdoors, where you want to maintain situational awareness. During the day, I&#39;m never too far from my wireless earbuds, but being able to get a bit of audio from my glasses in a pinch could be genuinely useful.</p><p>To control the Ray-Ban Stories, you can either invoke the Facebook assistant by saying &quot;Hey Facebook&quot; or by tapping the button on the right arm, or swiping on the side touchpad. Personally, I never want to be caught in public talking to Facebook, so I mostly relied on touch controls. But the voice controls worked just fine during the few occasions when nobody could hear my shame.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c81e6713-1134-11ec-beba-fa7f8faac28a" alt="Ray-Ban Stories" data-uuid="6c76005a-2aec-3ad2-9b3d-6da8f834fa74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ray-Ban and Facebook</div></figure><p>While they&#39;re not exactly perfect, the Ray-Ban Stories are the first smart glasses I&#39;d recommend to someone looking for a pair. But the Facebook of it all is still concerning. While the company says the glasses will only collect basic information to be functional — things like the battery level, your Facebook login and Wi-Fi details — who knows how that&#39;ll change as its future smart glasses become more fully featured. Perhaps that&#39;s why there&#39;s no Facebook branding on the Ray-Ban Stories case and frames: It&#39;s probably better if people forget these are also Facebook-powered products.</p><p>You&#39;ll be able to buy Ray-Ban Stories today in 20 different styles in the US, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy and the UK. Even though the Ray-Ban Stories may seem to have limited availability right now, Facebook and Luxottica have a multi-year partnership that will result in even more products. It&#39;s likely that true AR glasses, which can display information on your lenses, aren&#39;t far off.

You can look at photos from the original Canon 5D, released in 2005, and they look pretty good! In some tests of performance, sensors seem to have barely changed in the past decade. However, there have been big advancements in noise reduction, dynamic range and how fast sensors can be read, which have not only improved image quality, but enabled photographers to work in more challenging environments and shoot in new ways. While the original 5D could capture three 13-megapixel images per second at a native ISO 1600, Sony&#39;s latest a1 can shoot 30 50-megapixel images at a native ISO 32,000 in the same timeframe.</p><p>In the latest episode of our Upscaled series, we explain how sensors work, and how camera makers have overcome the physical challenges of trying capture a lot of light in a very short time.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html">HT-A7000</a> is also the first of the company&#39;s soundbars to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-360-reality-audio-ces-2021-130027671.html">support 360 Reality Audio</a>. The device is premium in every way, from connectivity options that include both 8K and 4K/120fps passthrough right down to the $1,300 price tag. If you don&#39;t want to spend that much, but still crave the same features, Sony announced another home theater speaker today. The <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/soundbars/all-soundbars/p/hta5000">HT-A5000</a> is a 5.1.2-channel soundbar that offers nearly all of the same bells and whistles as the A7000, but for $400 less.</p><p>In addition to Dolby Atmos, the A5000 also supports DTS:X, and Sony&#39;s Vertical Surround Engine simulates audio above your head thanks two a pair of upward firing drivers. S-Force Pro Front Surround creates a wider soundscape horizontally, using the company&#39;s X-Balanced speakers and &quot;digital sound field processing&quot; tech in an attempt to make things more immersive. In terms of the actual speakers, the A5000 has seven of those X-Balanced drivers: two up-firing, three front-firing, two built-in subwoofers. The soundbar also packs in a pair of beam tweeters situated on the front corners of the device. If you happen to own a compatible Bravia TV, Sony offers a Center Speaker Mode that uses the television speakers to boost the center channel. The company says that this can help with things like dialog and a secondary wired connection to the TV ensures sound and visuals are in sync.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To properly calibrate the A5000 to your living room, Sony&#39;s Sound Field Optimization feature uses built-in microphones to measure speaker position in relation to the walls and the ceiling. This tool can also assess the position of any satellite speakers or a subwoofer to ensure the system is properly adjusted for the space.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/89cd80c0-1113-11ec-be5d-a5d3e46e5f40" alt="Sony HT-A5000" data-uuid="5e171d3d-ebb2-34e4-b208-42cce04f3975"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>For connectivity, a single HDMI eARC output allows for 8K HDR, 4K/120Hz and Dolby Vision passthrough, making the A5000 a worthy option for gaming in addition to movies and television. The soundbar also offers AirPlay 2, Chromecast, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth and WiFi for wireless connections, in addition to Alexa and Google Assistant for voice control via a separate device. The A5000 is compatible with Hi-Res Audio content and it employs Sony&#39;s AI-powered DSEE Extreme technology to upscale compressed files in real time, restoring someof the detail that&#39;s otherwise lost. 360 Reality Audio is available for use here via Amazon Music HD, Deezer, Tidal or nugs.net.</p><p>There are a few key differences between the A7000 and the A5000. First, the former is a 7.1.2-channel soundbar while the latter is 5.1.2. Depending on your sonic preferences, those two extra channels and two extra speakers may make a difference in immersive sound. Typically, more channels and more speakers means better audio quality and more detail, but some folks may be just fine with a 5.1.2 setup. On the A7000, the tweeters are positioned in a way so that they bounce sound off the side walls to help with the overall immersion. Lastly, the A5000 only has one HDMI 2.1 (eARC) input and the A7000 has two. From supported audio formats to Sony&#39;s various home theater tech, nearly all of what the A7000 has to offer is available on the A5000.</p><section data-eng-breakout="876bc675dedd493bb948add0897cfd4c" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/be2a0b40-1113-11ec-aafb-564d897face2" alt="Sony HT-A5000"></section><p>Like the A7000, the A5000 works with Sony&#39;s latest arsenal of satellite speakers and subwoofers. The company announced two subwoofer options, the <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/sasw5">SA-SW5</a> and <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/sasw3">SA-SW3</a>, and <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/sars3s">a pair of rear satellite speakers (SA-RS3S)</a> as separate add-ons when it debuted the A7000 in July. All three connect to the HT-A5000 wirelessly. The difference between the two subs is the SW5 packs 300 watts of booming bass via a 7-inch driver and the SW3 offers 200 watts of low-end tone with a 6-inch speaker.&nbsp;</p><p>The HT-A5000 will go on sale &quot;in early fall&quot; for $900 at Sony retailers. The SA-SW5 and SA-SW3 subwoofers are $700 and $400 respectively, while the SA-RS3S satellite speakers are $350. All three of those expansion items should be available in September or October alongside the A7000. Sony hasn&#39;t yet announced exact dates for any of this new home theater gear just yet.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a5000-soundbar-announced-specs-price-availability-140034265.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">da6c85c1-b5be-4ae2-98bf-6ed19087bf3c</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 14:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631196814</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T14:13:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3223a8c0-1101-11ec-97f5-d93fe3ab227d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3223a8c0-1101-11ec-97f5-d93fe3ab227d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony HT-A5000]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony HT-A5000]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best gaming laptops you can buy, plus how to pick one]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a few years now, gaming laptops have been some of the most intriguing PCs around. They’ve gotten thinner and lighter, naturally — but they’ve also become vastly more powerful and efficient, making them suitable for both work and play. They’ve adopted some bold innovations, like rotating hinges and near desktop-like customizability. Gaming laptops are where PC makers can get adventurous.</p><p>If you’re a professional in the market for a beefy new computer, and you like to play a few rounds of <em>Apex Legends</em> on occasion, it may make more sense to go for a gaming notebook instead of a MacBook Pro-like workstation. You’ll still get plenty of power for video encoding and 3D rendering, plus you may end up paying less than you would for some comparable workstations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/1c6ceae0-e935-11ea-9d63-fcfd47b39fd9" alt="ASUS ROG G14" data-uuid=""><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar/Engadget </figcaption></figure><h2><br>What&#39;s your budget?&nbsp;</h2><p>Your laptop buying journey starts and ends with the amount of money you&#39;re willing to spend. No surprise there. The good news: There are plenty of options for gamers of every budget. In particular, we&#39;re seeing some great choices under $1,000, like Dell&#39;s G15, which currently starts at $930. PCs in this price range will definitely feel a bit lower quality than pricier models, and they&#39;ll likely skimp on RAM, storage and overall power. But they should be able to handle most games in 1080p at 60 frames per second, which is the bare minimum you&#39;d want from any system.</p><p>Stepping up to mid-range options beyond $1,000 is where things get interesting. At that point, you&#39;ll start finding PCs like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-190037967.html">ASUS Zephyrus ROG G14</a>, one of our favorite gaming notebooks of the last few years. In general, you can look forward to far better build quality than budget laptops (metal cases!), improved graphics power and enough RAM and storage space to handle the most demanding games. These are the notebooks we&#39;d recommend for most people, as they&#39;ll keep you gaming and working for years before you need to worry about an upgrade.</p><p>If you&#39;re willing to spend around $1,800 or more, you can start considering more premium options like Razer&#39;s Blade. Expect impeccably polished cases, the fastest hardware on the market, and ridiculously thin designs. The sky&#39;s the limit here: Alienware&#39;s uber customizable Area 51m is an enormous beast that can cost up to $4,700. Few people need a machine that pricey, but if you&#39;re a gamer with extra cash to burn, it may be worth taking a close look at some of these pricier systems.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/a3e1f580-e933-11ea-bf65-73681726b0ba" alt="Origin Evo16" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2><br>What kind of CPU and GPU do you want?</h2><p>The answer to this question used to be relatively simple: Just get an Intel chip with an NVIDIA GPU. But over the last two years, AMD came out swinging with its Ryzen 4000 and 5000-series  notebook processors, which are better suited for juggling multiple tasks at once (like streaming to Twitch while blasting fools in <em>Fortnite</em>). In general, you’ll still be safe getting one of Intel’s latest 10th or 11th-gen H-series chips. But it’s nice to have decent AMD alternatives available for budget and mid-range laptops, especially when they’re often cheaper than comparable Intel models.</p><p>When it comes to video cards, though, AMD is still catching up. Its new Radeon RX 6000M GPU has been a fantastic performer in notebooks like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-review-amd-radeon-rx-6000m-120031416.html">ASUS’s ROG Strix G15</a>, but it still lags behind NVIDIA when it comes to newer features like ray tracing. I’ll admit, it’s nice to see a Radeon-powered notebook that can approach the general gaming performance of NVIDIA’s RTX 3070 and 3080 GPU.</p><p>If you want to future-proof your purchase, or you’re just eager to see how ray tracing could make your games look better, you’re probably better off with an NVIDIA video card. They’re in far more systems, and it’s clear that NVIDIA has had more time to optimize its ray tracing technology. RTX GPUs also feature the company’s DLSS feature, which uses AI to upscale games to higher resolutions. That’ll let you play a game like <em>Destiny 2</em> in 4K with faster frame rates. That’s useful if you’re trying to take advantage of a high refresh rate monitor.</p><p>NVIDIA’s RTX 3050 is a decent entry point, but we think you’d be better off with at least an RTX 3060 for solid 1080p and 1440p performance. The RTX 3070, meanwhile, is the best balance of price and performance. It’ll be able to run many games in 4K with the help of DLSS, and it can even tackle demanding titles like <em>Control</em>. NVIDIA’s RTX 3080 is the king of the hill; you’ll pay a premium for any machine that includes it.</p><p>It’s worth noting that NVIDIA’s mobile GPUs aren’t directly comparable to its more powerful desktop hardware. PC makers can also tweak a GPU’s voltage to make it perform better in a thinner case. Basically, don’t be surprised if you see notebooks that perform very differently, even if they’re all equipped with the same RTX model.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/22960650-e934-11ea-92de-9913d49e86b1" alt="Razer Blade 15" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2><br>What kind of screen do you want?</h2><p>Screen size is a good place to start when judging gaming notebooks. In general, 15-inch laptops will be the best balance of immersion and portability, while larger 17-inch models are heftier, but naturally give you more screen real estate. There are some 13-inch gaming notebooks, like the Razer Blade Stealth, but paradoxically you&#39;ll often end up paying more for those than slightly larger 15-inch options. We’re also seeing more 14-inch options, like the Zephyrus G14 and Blade 14, which are generally more powerful than 13-inch laptops while still being relatively portable.</p><p>But these days, there are plenty more features to consider than screen size alone. Consider refresh rates: Most monitors refresh their screens vertically 60 times per second, or 60Hz. That&#39;s a standard in use since black and white NTSC TVs. But over the past few years, displays have evolved considerably. Now, 120Hz 1080p screens are the bare minimum you&#39;d want in any gaming notebook — and there are faster 144Hz, 240Hz and even 360Hz panels. All of those ever-increasing numbers are in the service of one thing: making everything on your display look as smooth as possible.</p><p>For games, higher refresh rates also help eliminate screen tearing and other artifacts that could get in the way of your frag fest. And for everything else, it just leads to a better viewing experience. Even scrolling a web page on a 120Hz or faster monitor is starkly different from a 60Hz screen. Instead of seeing a jittery wall of text and pictures, everything moves seamlessly together, as if you&#39;re unwinding a glossy paper magazine. Going beyond 120Hz makes gameplay look even more responsive, which to some players gives them a slight advantage.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/821d1030-e936-11ea-9d7f-aed162772f3d" alt="Gigabyte Aero 15" data-uuid=""><figcaption>Steve Dent/Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>Not to make things more complicated, but you should also keep an eye out for NVIDIA&#39;s G-SYNC and AMD&#39;s FreeSync. They&#39;re both adaptive sync technologies that can match your screen&#39;s refresh rate with the framerate of your game. That also helps to reduce screen tearing and make gameplay smoother. Consider them nice bonuses on top of a high refresh rate monitor; they&#39;re not necessary, but they can still offer a slight visual improvement.</p><p>One more thing: Most of these suggestions are related to LCD screens, not OLEDs. While OLED makes a phenomenal choice for TVs, it&#39;s a bit more complicated when it comes to gaming laptops. They&#39;re limited to 60Hz, so you won&#39;t get the smoother performance you&#39;d find on a high refresh rate screen. And they&#39;re typically 4K panels; you&#39;ll need a ton of GPU power to run games natively at that resolution. OLED laptops still look incredible, with the best black levels and contrast on the market, but we think most shoppers would be better off with an LCD gaming laptop.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/7a4d3480-e935-11ea-9ffa-4c77ce132136" alt="ASUS ROG G14" data-uuid=""><figcaption>Devindra Hardawar/Engadget </figcaption></figure><h3><br>A few other takeaways:</h3><ul><li><p>Get at least 16GB of RAM. And if you&#39;re planning to do a ton of multitasking while streaming, 32GB is worth considering.</p></li><li><p>Storage is still a huge concern. These days, I&#39;d recommend aiming for a 1TB M.2 SSD, which should be enough space to juggle a few large titles like Destiny 2. Some laptops also have room for standard SATA drives, which are far cheaper than M.2&#39;s and can hold more data.</p></li><li><p>Normally we&#39;d recommend getting your hands on a system before you buy, but that&#39;s tough as we&#39;re in the midst of a pandemic. I&#39;d recommend snagging your preferred system from a retailer with a simple return policy, like Amazon or Best Buy. If you don&#39;t like it, you can always ship it back easily.</p></li><li><p>Don&#39;t forget about accessories!

It&#39;s compact, at just 3.5 pounds, and features AMD&#39;s new Ryzen 5000-series chips paired together with NVIDIA&#39;s latest graphics. It&#39;s a shockingly compact machine, and while its 14-inch screen is a bit smaller than our other recommendations, it looks great and features a fast 144Hz refresh rate. We also like its retro-future design (some configurations have tiny LEDs on its rear panel for extra flair). While the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-190037967.html">G14</a> has jumped in price since last year, it’s still one of the best gaming notebooks around.

Warner Bros. has finally shared the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ix7TUGVYIo">first trailer</a> for <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-20-the-matrix-4-whoa.html">long-anticipated</a> fourth movie in the sci-fi action series.

As you&#39;d expect, though, he begins to question reality and finds the truth underneath, including a reunion with Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss).</p><p>You&#39;ll also see Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as a Morpheus-like figure, and Jessica Henwick (<em>Game of Thrones</em>) enticing Neo to rediscover the Matrix.

The Polestar 2 Launch Edition arrived last year with every bell and whistle the company could manage to pack into its frame. For the 2022 model year, Polestar is taking a different tack by splitting the vehicle’s bevy of features into optional packages fitted onto a surprisingly well-appointed — and inexpensive — base mode.</p><p>The FWD version starts at $45,900 (as low as $34,900 after California incentives) and is outfitted with a single-speed AC synchronous permanent magnet motor using a 10.51:1 gear ratio. That motor delivers 231 HP, 243 ft-lb of torque, and a lengthy 265-mile range — 35 miles more than last year’s model, putting the 2022 FWD Polestar 2 on par with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">VW ID.4</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-01-2019-hyundai-kona-ev-car-review.html">Hyundai Kona EV</a>, and the Chevy Bolt (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-expands-fire-risk-recall-all-chevy-bolt-115934063.html">assuming the latter isn’t currently on fire</a>). It offers a 100 MPH top speed with a 0-60 of 7 seconds.</p><p>The AWD version starts at $49,900 (down from last year’s $61,200 starting price) and utilizes a pair of permanent magnet motors (one on each axle) running 8.57:1 gear ratios. At that ratio, the performance-focused AWD Polestar 2 will have a higher top speed of 127 MPH, albeit at the cost of a nominally reduced 249-mile driving range. As such, the AWD puts out 408 HP between the two motors, 487 ft-lb of torque, and a 4.45-second 0-60.</p><p>Both variants will offer a $4,000 Plus Pack, which includes a full-length glass roof, &quot;premium&quot; interior including a 600W Harman Kardon stereo, powered seats, cabin illumination and the addition of a heat pump that uses waste energy from the drivetrain to heat the cabin interior and battery pack on cold days (while also improving range by up to 10 percent under certain climate conditions).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63361750-10bf-11ec-aef9-330d45227eb1" alt="2022 Polestar 2 Long range Single motor &amp; Long range Dual motor

If you’re hankering for real leather, that is available but comes at a premium price point. If you want the metallic Magnesium, Midnight, Snow, Moon, or Thunder paint options, they’ll set you back an extra $1,200.</p><p>The $3,200 Pilot Pack incorporates Advanced Driver Assist features like adaptive cruise control, blind spot warnings and a 360-degree camera. Only the AWD version, however, will have access to the $5,000 Performance pack which adds 20-inch alloys, Brembo brakes, sport tires, and upgraded suspension components. You’ll be able to spot Polestars with the performance pack by their bright yellow cosmetic accents on the brake calipers, seatbelts and valve caps. There is also a “blacked-out” option that eliminates all the chrome and colored exterior accents if you opt for the “Void” color scheme.</p><p>Regardless of the packages included, both Polestar variants run off the same 400V electrical architecture and 78 kWh (75kWh usable) capacity battery pack. The company has squeezed a few additional kW of charging capacity, 155 kW up from last year’s 150 using just software updates, for the 2022 models dropping the amount of time needed to refill from 10 percent charge to 80 percent to just 33 minutes. On a standard Level 2 AC charger (like what you&#39;d have installed in your home), you’re still looking at around 8 hours to fully repower the vehicle.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d9d29fa0-10bf-11ec-93f7-1acb34dbe859" alt="2022 Polestar 2 Long range Single motor &amp; Long range Dual motor

An 11-inch central infotainment display running <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-2-is-a-sporty-ev-fastback-with-allnew-android-automotive-140040133.html">Android Automotive</a> still dominates the vehicle’s minimalist dashboard. Rather than tethering or mirroring content from your mobile device, drivers will be able to log into the vehicle’s OS directly, granting them access to their Google accounts, contacts and the Google Play Store as well as natively running Google Maps, Spotify, YouTube Music and others.</p><p>Installing new apps is a cinch, a nearly identical process to doing so on your smartphone. Each new Polestar comes with 3 years of included access to Google Service Connectivity and LTE capability from AT&amp;T. The company anticipates that a steady stream of OTA updates will help keep the Polestar 2’s features and performance continually up to date. Polestar also plans to extend its latest OTA service to the 2021 model year so Launch Edition vehicles will enjoy the latest and greatest in software updates.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/03fbc680-10c0-11ec-a2fd-413b2699c37d" alt="2022 Polestar 2 Long range Single motor &amp; Long range Dual motor

At more than a mile above sea level, the air is so thin that conventional internal combustion engines (ICEs) can lose as much as 30 percent of their power output (roughly a hundred HP). Thank goodness battery electric vehicles (BEVs) like the Polestar have no need for triflings like oxygen. No matter how high it climbed, every last one of the FWD Polestar’s 231 horses remained available — still chomping at the bit, if you will.</p><p>Snapping awake from an unplanned anaphylactic nap, I find myself charging through the rolling hills of New Mexico State Road 4 while it winds its way through the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/vall/index.htm">Valles Caldera National Preserve</a>. Of course, because it’s being pulled along by its leading axle, the FWD Polestar 2 does tend to swing wider through turns (as front drive vehicles are wont to do) compared to its AWD cousin, which led to a couple of hair-raising encounters with oncoming vehicles who were themselves shading the narrow two-lane’s centerline.</p><p>“If you are thinking of flying a drone to take video of the car near Los Alamos National Lab,” Polestar PR warned us before we took off for the initial test drive. “Don’t. The government has been known to shoot them down.”</p><p>So instead, here’s a picture of the <a href="https://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Weapons/W80.html">W80</a> that was awaiting us at the <a href="https://www.losalamoshistory.org/">National Museum of Nuclear Science and History</a> at the end of the drive’s initial leg. Coffee, snacks and selectable-yield thermonuclear warhead displays, oh my.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ac8bda80-10be-11ec-bf5f-77e2cf45679d" alt="W-80 thermonuclear warhead" data-uuid="e54fc1e0-3a35-37f3-8545-7cb58c244c12"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">National Museum of Nuclear Science and History</div></figure><p>The choice between the FWD and AWD versions of the 2022 Polestar 2 is not an easy one. For nearly all intents and purposes, the two are functionally identical both inside and out. The question you’ll have to answer for yourself is whether you want a fast, sporty and stylish ride with 265 miles of range or whether you want to trade in 16 of those miles for an extra 177 HP of head-snapping acceleration.</p><p>It’s mid-afternoon and I’m hill-climbing the absurdly tall, 10,000-foot high mountain that leads <a href="https://skisantafe.com/">Ski Santa Fe</a>. It started raining about 20 minutes ago, the temperature is dropping, and that gentle pitter-patter of formerly refreshing precipitation is now doing its best to become a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WX2SWD6mZc">Class 3 Kill Storm</a>. When I raced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-2-is-a-sporty-ev-fastback-with-allnew-android-automotive-140040133.html">along Skyline Blvd in 2019</a>, the skies were clear and my right foot was a rotund demon with 408 Launch Edition horses at its beck and call.</p><p>Today, the skies were crying and the roads were revolting, but had just as much power at my disposal with the AWD Polestar 2’s accelerator pedal underfoot. It’s raining, it’s hailing, it’s snowing, minor landslides are depositing forearm-sized stones into the roadway. The Polestar barely seemed to notice the hazards — easily forging through spontaneous road rivers, slush piles, and newly laid rock beds — while charging up the tightly winding hillside.

First up, the Fire TV Omni series is a lineup of 4K screens in 43-, 50-, 55-, 65- and 75-inch sizes. The smaller trio in that lust support HDR10, hybrid log gamma HDR (HLG) and Dolby Digital Plus, as well as the usual Alexa integrations. The larger pair, the 65- and 75-inch models, also get Dolby Vision, as well as a thinner bezel to better fit into your room decor.</p><p>These new screens come with a whole bunch of Alexa integrations and links to the broader Amazon ecosystem. As we’ve seen on other Fire TV units, far-field microphones will let you speak to Alexa from across the room, and lets you control the rest of your smart home from the couch. As well as the usual recommendations and curation, the Omni will also let you access TikTok straight from your TV. You’ll also be able to speak to your visitors if you have a Ring doorbell, and if you plug in a webcam to your TV, you can use it for both Alexa calling and Zoom, when that feature is enabled later this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Price-wise, these TVs will start at $410 for the 43-inch model and fly all the way up to $1,100 for the 75-inch beefy boi. All of them will be exclusive to Amazon and Best Buy, although it’s worth noting that Amazon is knocking up to $110 off the 50-inch Omni as an introductory offer, making it cheaper than the 43-incher, when they arrive over the next month.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91c91e30-1152-11ec-be88-f1f2ecb67752" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Amazon 4-series TV" data-uuid="b110450b-6d90-39c9-96ba-abd81ce6d566"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon is also looking after the lower-end with the “4-series” range of smart TVs, which offer HDR10 and HLG. The lineup includes 43-, 50- and 55-inch sizes, with the same Fire TV smarts and Alexa integrations you&#39;ll find on pretty much any comparable Fire TV device. Naturally, Amazon is targeting price with this series, and the 43-inch model will be priced at $370, while $470 and $520 will be enough to grab you the 50-and 55-inch units, respectively. Similarly, Amazon will offer discounts on select models here as well.</p><p>Of course, if the idea of handing Amazon even more of your cash fills you with dread, you can also get new Fire TV sets from other manufacturers. Pioneer, for instance, is launching a new 4K set in 43-and-50-inch sizes with HDR10 and Dolby Vision, as well as picture-in-picture with a compatible device. Toshiba, meanwhile, is launching a range of Fire TV sets with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-04-amazon-ifa-2019-fire-tv-cube.html">far-field voice</a>, which has been a must-have for Fire TV devices for years at this point. These models, however, won&#39;t be available until the spring of 2022, but Amazon promises that you’ll get “high-end picture quality in large format sizes,” including a 55-, 65- and 75-inch model.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4975cc50-1152-11ec-bbef-726f53e05fa8" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Image of the new 4K Stick" data-uuid="ad34c891-5f9c-3fb7-a8ce-dbfc53fdd815"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>If you’re already happy with your TV, however, then Amazon also has the new TV Stick 4K Max to plug into your existing set. The stick is packing a new processor, 2GB RAM and WiFi 6, which Amazon says will make it smoother, faster and <em>bettererier</em> than any other streaming stick on the market. You’ll also get a bunch of the same Alexa voice features and access to Amazon Luna, the company’s cloud gaming service. The hardware also supports 4K, HDR, HDR10+ and Dolby Atmos, offers live view picture-in-picture and comes with the new Alexa voice remote. When available, it’ll cost you $55 for the privilege of owning one, too.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-2021-update-omni-fire-tv-4-series-130041393.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a0b1d53f-192c-4d0f-bf6d-4a6d523e20d0</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 13:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631181175</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T09:53:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e1940480-1151-11ec-bfdc-668be011a5f8" width="2346" height="1170" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e1940480-1151-11ec-bfdc-668be011a5f8" width="2346" height="1170" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of Amazon's first US homegrown TV, the Omni.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Omni]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter tests four new emoji Tweet reactions alongside 'Like']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Other than some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-16-twitter-tests-emoji-reactions.html">developer tests</a>, Twitter has only ever offered you one way to react to tweets: the classic heart &quot;Like&quot; emoji and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-03-twitter-hearts-replaces-stars.html">prior to 2015</a>, the &quot;Favorite&quot; star button. Now, the social media network might be finally expanding that range as it&#39;s testing a new feature called &quot;Reactions&quot; with additional emoji over the coming days.&nbsp;</p><p>In Turkey only for a limited time, the company is testing four new emojis on top of the heart icon: 😂, 🤔, 👏 and 😢, aka &quot;tears of joy,&quot; &quot;thinking face,&quot; &quot;clapping hands&quot; and &quot;crying face.&quot; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-16-twitter-tests-emoji-reactions.html">Back in 2015</a>, Twitter tested a wider variety including the the &quot;100,&quot; &quot;heart eyes&quot; and other emoji. However, this time it wanted to &quot;find emoji that are universally recognizable and represent what people want to express about Tweets,&quot; the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ce7f3ce0-114a-11ec-bfb6-b760868e6a6d" style="height:632;width:1203;" alt="Twitter is testing four new emoji Tweet reactions beyond &#39;Like&#39;" data-uuid="9b12b646-110d-35b6-85ca-6f9d52f75ba8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twitter</div></figure><p>Twitter narrowed it down to those additional four after conducting surveys and researching what the most common words and emoji are in Tweets. It found that the most popular one is the laughing emoji, and that people want to express reactions centered around &quot;funny,&quot; &quot;support/cheer,&quot; &quot;agreement&quot; and &quot;awesome.&quot; It also identified &quot;entertained&quot; and &quot;curious&quot; as the top emotions people feel when reading tweets.</p><p>Its surveys also revealed that &quot;frustration&quot; and &quot;anger&quot; were common emotions experienced by users. While some people wanted to express disagreement with Tweets, the company decided not to incorporate that. Rather, it&#39;s trying to see if the new, more positive emoji will drive &quot;healthy public conversations.&quot; It&#39;s also likely related to the high levels of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-18-disney-twitter-purchase-troll-problem.html">polarization and toxicity</a> on the site, something that Twitter has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-07-twitter-q4-2018.html">keen to reduce</a> over the past several years.</p><p>More specifically, Twitter said that reactions will help people better show how they feel in conversations &quot;while also giving those Tweeting a better understanding of how their Tweets are received.&quot;  The new reactions will be available in Turkey only for a limited time on Twitter for iOS, Android and the web over the coming days. However, it added that &quot;based on this test, we may expand the availability of the Reactions experiment to other regions.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-is-testing-tweet-emoji-reactions-beyond-like-130028667.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9a889c5c-a0e0-4cd7-8789-78fcf996ed0b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 13:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631178533</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T09:09:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/d5a67940-5fd2-11eb-9f5f-bb40263d5a28" width="3024" height="2016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/d5a67940-5fd2-11eb-9f5f-bb40263d5a28" width="3024" height="2016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Lam / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Twitter logo is seen outside the company headquarters, during a purported demonstration by supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump to protest the social media company's permanent suspension of the President's Twitter account, in San Francisco, California, U.S., January 11, 2021.

Starting today, the cloud gaming service is <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__bit.ly_lunaupdate&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=4XnKqRFDm0mwnVfbG_7nXKXgzVgRH60VeeJpScCw2DY&amp;m=rPy6EG9NC3YGmSTCRKSE9e2e3F5bS7FuJcQ2BHl3NQ4&amp;s=Zb3SwsCcb-AKwZGC3JgsiKso2_Dvvf3nUioAmvH5zJc&amp;e=">available on Fire tablets and Chromebooks</a>. With the expansion, Amazon is also introducing new hardware bundles you can buy to get access to the service without an invitation from the company.</p><p>One option is to spend $99 to buy a Fire TV Stick 4K Max and a Luna controller. Two other new bundles allow you to get a Fire HD 10 tablet or a Fire HD 8 tablet with a controller for $156 or $116 respectively.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>New hardware bundles aren’t the only way Amazon hopes to attract new subscribers to Luna. The company is also introducing a feature called Luna Couch. If you find yourself playing a game such as <em>Team Sonic Racing</em> that includes support for local cooperative play, you can invite one of your friends to play with you over the internet — even if they don’t have their own Luna subscription. The invite process involves creating a session code you share with your friend. If they want to play on PC or Mac, they’ll need to input that code online. Otherwise, on every other supported device, you input the code through the Luna app.</p><div id="eeffb9bf8dfa4c459bf1e67018b679cd"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7x414p5r9W4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Elsewhere, the company is making tweaks to channels. The Luna+ and Ubisoft+ channels now come with access to some 120 games between the two of them. They will be joined by two new channels. The Family Channel, available today, costs $2.99 per month and comes with a curated selection of more than 35 family-friendly titles, including <em>SpongeBob SquarePants: Battle for Bikini Bottom</em>. The other new addition, the Retro Gaming Channel, is coming “soon” and will include classic games from publishers like Atari and SNK.</p><p>Lastly, if you’re a current Prime Member in the mainland US, you can play four Luna games for seven days until September 15th.

(No Tom Holland, though.) This adventure’s point of divergence takes place during the events of <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp</em>, leading up to the events of <em>Infinity War</em>. It’s the biggest <em>What If...?</em> yet, in both cast and concept, and it also sheds a light on some characters still waiting for their day in the spotlight.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="93e00e59772941f6a21551ee8b51f395"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZAlRq4gLGhw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Janet Van Dyne contracts the zombie plague in the Quantum Realm and, when rescued, ends up spreading it to her husband and Scott Lang and things escalate from there. Even the Avengers end up infected, leaving the task of saving the world to characters who weren’t officially part of the team, like Wasp, Winter Soldier and Spider-Man. They’re joined by supporting characters like Sharon Carter, Okoye, Kurt and Happy Hogan. Bruce Banner is there too, but without the help of the Hulk. Just like in <em>Infinity War</em>, he refuses to emerge, leaving Bruce mostly defenseless.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8594c470-10e4-11ec-9fff-8329e43657a4" style="height:872;width:1740;" alt="Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier" data-uuid="486cd726-3fd2-3b5e-9bbc-dd9e7cca1d14"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>The episode also gives us a darker take on the Vision and Scarlet Witch, one that has a lot more meaning if you’ve watched all of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html"><em>WandaVision</em></a>. There’s also a nod to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-episode-six-captain-america-disney-plus-133033258.html"><em>The Falcon and Winter Soldier</em></a>, when zombie Sam Wilson gets cut in half. Bucky finds himself unfeeling about the whole thing, likely because this version of the characters haven’t had time to bond the way their live-action counterparts have.</p><p>Without Captain America and Iron Man to take the reins, the role of leader falls to, well, no one, really, with this motley group of heroes and side-characters operating as a collective. It seems to work for the team for the most part, though they ignore Peter Parker’s advice not to split up with disastrous results.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5deb4e20-10e5-11ec-9ff4-6b0deeb69f0a" style="height:1071;width:1510;" alt="" data-uuid="92ac3549-87c1-3a2d-8d16-b756b8db0a8f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>In fact, Peter is the star of the show here, despite his actor being unavailable to voice him. Just as he was in <em>Infinity War</em>, the kid is a solid team player who more than pulls his weight in combat. But this is also the first time we get to see other heroes interact with him on a more personal level. He isn’t just Tony Stark’s mascot here, instead the team ends up looking to him for moral support, the way they might have once admired Steve Rogers. It’s a nice glimpse of what Peter can be free of Iron Man’s shadow, a thread that will be more fully explored in this December’s <a href="https://youtu.be/rt-2cxAiPJk"><em>No Way Home</em></a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/443ba430-10e4-11ec-8b39-38c90ac1c6f7" style="height:873;width:1905;" alt="Kurt and Bruce Banner" data-uuid="c6476839-d7e2-3860-8a85-757cd9037597"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>In the <a href="https://youtu.be/0WVDKZJkGlY">teaser for the upcoming Eternals film</a>, one of the characters, Sprite, asks who will lead the Avengers now. Though the answer is unlikely to come out of that particular movie, this most recent <em>What If…?</em> suggests a few intriguing possibilities. While Peter forms the heart of the team here, a lot of the thinking falls to Bruce Banner. He’s a character that’s gone underused in the MCU thus far, thanks to Universal holding the film rights. A lot of his development has had to happen off-screen, but starting with 2018’s <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> and continuing with the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-disney-plus-ms-marvel-she-hulk-moon-knight.html"><em>She-Hulk</em></a> show, he’s gently getting nudged to the forefront of the Avengers. With Captain America, Iron Man and Black Widow dead and Thor off in space, he’s the natural choice to take the reins as one of two OG team members left (and if you’ve seen <em>Shang-Chi</em>, it seems he may already have).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/193d6820-10e6-11ec-9e7f-76ba78e734eb" style="height:861;width:1916;" alt="Bruce Banner and Peter Parker" data-uuid="b360c3e1-b452-3ccb-a0e8-6c841fc5c667"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>Ultimately, like all <em>What If…?</em> episodes this installment doesn’t actually matter to the grander MCU, though its open-ended nature raises the possibility of a sequel — and given how many Marvel Zombies comics are out there, it’s almost guaranteed we’ll see this reality on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/P0ab6Y">Disney+</a> again. But for fans who don’t care for this week’s horror elements the story is still a valuable tease for how a post-blip, second generation Avengers roster could function.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-five-zombies-120013622.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cec4026e-5316-4f47-b28f-dd584c76b941</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 12:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631136357</ingested><modified>2021-09-08T21:26:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e67f5d50-10e3-11ec-bbfe-9d3171d4c154" width="1914" height="866" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e67f5d50-10e3-11ec-bbfe-9d3171d4c154" width="1914" height="866" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bruce Banner, Kurt, Hope Pym, Peter Parker, Sharon Carter, Happy Hogan]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[What if...

It’s not my go-to grocery store, so I usually only pick up an item or two.

Shelves have sensors to detect when shoppers take items — and it’s all pretty amazing. Except when it gets things wrong. At one point, I went in to grab a newspaper (what? I like the supplements?) and some milk. Unfortunately, it added a couple more items to my purchase, and you’re only informed of this when you’re billed after leaving the store. To Amazon’s credit, it was quick to refund me once I flagged the issue through the app. It’s early days for the tech, which is predictably being refined as each shopper passes through its stores. There’s also something convenient about packing away your shopping as you browse.</p><p>I only saw staff monitoring check-ins, as most people were confused by the conceit of the place, and filling shelves, but unions have <a href="https://www.ufcw.org/press-releases/ufcw-amazon-grocery-expansion-with-cashierless-technology-threatens-good-paying-jobs-of-essential-workers/"><ins>said</ins></a> Amazon&#39;s cashierless tech will cost workers jobs at some point. The company says new Whole Foods locations will &quot;employ a comparable number of team members as existing Whole Foods stores of similar sizes.&quot;</p><p>This could be just the start. Amazon signed a deal last year to license its technology to third-party retailers, so even if there’s not a Whole Foods (or Amazon Fresh or Go) near you, you might not need a check-out.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-vulnerability-malicious-office-files-105010735.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Microsoft issues warning on Windows attack that uses malicious Office files</a></h2><h3>Don&#39;t open Office files unless it&#39;s from a source you fully trust.</h3><h3></h3><p>Microsoft is warning that some attackers are actively exploiting a remote code execution vulnerability using malicious Office files.
