In its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2021-Q4/press-release-webcast">Q4 earnings report today</a>, the company reported a 21 percent increase in revenues compared to last year, reaching $46.2 billion. But even more impressive, its profits jumped by 47 percent to reach $16.5 billion. Microsoft&#39;s success is practically a broken record by this point — last quarter it saw <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-q3-2021-earnings-report-pandemic-204921611.html">a 44 percent increase in profit</a>, and before that it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-earnings-q2-2021-214039752.html">grew by 33 percent</a> — but it&#39;s still managing to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-q4-earnings-2021-205140685.html">beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts</a>.</p><p>The key to Microsoft&#39;s growth is the same as it has been for the past several years. Its Intelligent Cloud business is seemingly unstoppable, growing by 30 percent compared to last year. And it&#39;s still seeing plenty of growth with Office, Linkedin and its other business apps, which together have increased revenues by 25 percent. Even its More Personal Computing group, which includes Windows and Xbox, saw its business improve by 9 percent. (Thatcategory saw a few dips in the quarter though: Surface business fell by 20 percent, and Xbox content and services saw a 4 percent drop.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Microsoft&#39;s Q4 earnings aren&#39;t really telling us anything new, as the company&#39;s entire 2021 fiscal year has been strong. The company reported an overall revenue increase of 18 percent for 2021 ($168.1 billion), as well as a 38 percent jump in profit for the year ($61.3 billion). Microsoft&#39;s previous earnings report proved that it made out well during the pandemic, but now it seems like those gains aren&#39;t stopping anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-q4-fy21-earnings-203724611.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">51e4e51b-9a7f-499a-a161-3d1701fd3d5a</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 20:37:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627418297</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T20:38:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1fb5d60-ef19-11eb-b277-3a0c338c7138" width="4865" height="3392" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1fb5d60-ef19-11eb-b277-3a0c338c7138" width="4865" height="3392" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[3D-printed Microsoft logos are seen on a computer motherboard in this picture illustration taken July 22, 2021.

That&#39;s a jump of 62 percent from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-alphabet-q1-2020-earnings-210401873.html">same period last year</a>, when the organization&#39;s revenue dipped due to the onset of the pandemic. Last quarter, Alphabet posted $55.3 billion in revenue. Clearly, the company has long recovered from the slump it faced from the pandemic last year. Like chief financial officer Ruth Porat said on an earnings call, its results are &quot;lapping the impact of COVID on our business.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Like it did last quarter, Alphabet&#39;s net income rose significantly, from about $7 billion in Q2 2020 to $18.5 billion in the same period this year. Most of its money continues to come from advertising and search, while Google Cloud and its &quot;Other Bets&quot; division saw modest revenue growth as well.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement that &quot;a rising tide of online activity in many parts of the world&quot; and &quot;long-term investments in AI and Google Cloud&quot; drove the results. Pichai also said on the company&#39;s earnings call that it set &quot;a number of records this quarter.&quot; Publisher partners earned more than ever from Google&#39;s network, he said, and Alphabet has paid more to its YouTube creators and partners than any quarter in history.</p><p>Pichai also shouted out recent developments in AI across Google&#39;s portfolio, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-hands-on-181528378.html">upcoming Android 12</a>, updated <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">conversation technology LaMDA </a>and more. He also emphasized Google Cloud, detailing developments in security solutions and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-workspace-open-everyone-free-spaces-100004157.html">Workspace</a>, including the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-smart-canvas-productivity-app-172323639.html">Smart Canvas that it showed off</a> at Google I/O.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Pichai said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-available-globally-161554248.html">YouTube Shorts</a> (its TikTok-like feature) broke a new record by surpassing 15 billion daily views. YouTube subscriptions across things like Premium and Music also continue to grow. He also gave an update on self-driving vehicle company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-213249367.html">Waymo</a>, which first launched its services to the public in October 2020. Since then, it&#39;s &quot;served thousands of rides without a human driver,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, since the bulk of Alphabet&#39;s money comes from advertising, much of the earnings call dwelled on how retailers used Google&#39;s product to market their services to consumers. Chief business officer Philipp Schindler also spent some time talking about YouTube&#39;s reach, and how it&#39;s able to reach an audience that traditional TV and broadcast networks don&#39;t.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the company&#39;s Other Bets division, which covers its hardware products, cost a lot more money than it made this quarter, it&#39;s possible some of those investments will pay off in the months to come, since Google typically launches new phones in the fall. Porat closed the call with some statements on outlook, saying, &quot;We believe it&#39;s still too early to forecast the longer term trends as markets reopen, especially given the recent increase in COVID cases globally.&quot; While it&#39;s not guaranteed to continue posting super strong results for the quarters to come, we&#39;re sure Alphabet is going to be okay.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-google-earnings-q2-2021-202832294.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aac89cdd-9d8a-4b35-bd2a-a7d786283bee</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 20:28:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627419479</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T20:58:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95d5ff40-eef5-11eb-bfcd-dec53336397b" width="4388" height="2926" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95d5ff40-eef5-11eb-bfcd-dec53336397b" width="4388" height="2926" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shannon Stapleton / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The outside of Google headquarters is seen in New York City, U.S., June 17, 2021.

The buyer, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-09-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-album.html"><ins>it later turned out</ins></a>, was former pharmaceutical exec and convicted dirtbag <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-13-martin-shkreli-ordered-to-jail.html"><ins>Martin Shkreli</ins></a>.</p><p>Perhaps better known as Pharma Bro, Shkreli became infamous for buying and jacking up the price of life-saving AIDS medication Daraprim from $13.50 to $700 per pill. He was later convicted on securities fraud and securities fraud conspiracy charges and sentenced to seven years in prison. A forfeiture judgment of about $7.4 million was also made against Shkreli, and the government later seized assets to satisfy the judgment — including the album.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All of which brings us to today. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/united-states-sells-unique-wu-tang-clan-album-forfeited-convicted-hedge-fund-manager"><ins>The government has sold</ins></a><em>Once Upon a Time In Shaolin</em>. Prosecutors didn&#39;t say who bought the album or how much they paid, but the sale covers the outstanding balance Shkreli owed the government.</p><p>So, after three years of being locked in a federal vault, and almost four years of being owned by the weaselly Shkreli (who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-06-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-ebay.html"><ins>tried to sell it on eBay</ins></a> before he was incarcerated), the album is once again in private ownership. Although snippets of the album <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-09-wu-tang-ultra-rare-album-stream.html"><ins>have popped up online</ins></a>, you probably shouldn&#39;t expect it to hit Spotify any time soon, unfortunately.</p><p>One of the conditions for the auction sale was that the buyer couldn&#39;t use it for commercial purposes until 2103. It&#39;s unclear whether that stipulation is still in place, but Shkreli was allowed to play it at listening parties. Maybe the new proprietor of <em>Once Upon a Time In Shaolin </em>will feel generous enough to play it for Wu-Tang fans somewhere. Meanwhile, as is the way of things, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-album-141015209.html"><ins>Netflix is making a movie about the saga</ins></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pharma-bro-martin-shkrelis-wu-tang-clan-album-sold-192829283.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">86204623-ba55-4f2e-9586-6e5e25ef61ec</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 19:28:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627414112</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T19:28:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ed4d0dd0-ef0f-11eb-8bb7-7d0672bd4dba" width="5283" height="3523" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ed4d0dd0-ef0f-11eb-8bb7-7d0672bd4dba" width="5283" height="3523" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carlo Allegri / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Former drug company executive Martin Shkreli exits U.S. District Court after being convicted of securities fraud, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, U.S., August 4, 2017.

According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-employees-plan-walkout-wednesday-to-1847362030"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, at least 50 employees will protest the company&#39;s recent actions in person and call on it to improve working conditions for women by at least temporarily leaving their posts on Wednesday, July 28th.

Still, out of a desire to create  “safe and unbelievable experiences for all,” the company is introducing a new silicone cover that fits over the component. Whether you’ve had issues with the insert or not, you can request that Facebook send you the silicone cover for free. To do so, go to the “My Devices” section of your <a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/removable-facial-interface-alert/"><ins>account page</ins></a> and click the dedicated button that’s there.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook is also halting sales of the Oculus Quest temporarily while it works with distributors to add the silicone cover to every Quest 2 package. The company anticipates the headset will be back on store shelves by August 24th. As part of today’s recall, Facebook is also introducing a new 128GB variant of the Oculus Quest 2. It will replace the existing 64GB model, and feature the same $299 price tag as its predecessor. The 128GB model will go on sale on August 24th, the same day the company plans to restart Quest 2 sales.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/quest-2-foam-facial-interface-recall-163432642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2aac1db1-10fc-40be-8020-69c05893639b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:34:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627403677</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T16:34:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0c308010-eef7-11eb-bf95-d05c8071270a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0c308010-eef7-11eb-bf95-d05c8071270a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2 foam insert]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2 foam insert]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix turned a Twitter account into an animated show]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yet another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> account has been turned into a TV show. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix"><ins>Netflix</ins></a> has adapted Chicago Party Aunt (<a href="https://twitter.com/ChiPartyAunt"><ins>@ChiPartyAunt</ins></a>) into an adult animated series of the same name.</p><p>Actor Chris Witaske, who&#39;s perhaps best known for his role in Netflix series <em>Love</em>, is behind the account.

Last week, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-tv-update-features-from-google-tv-160004195.html">Android TV</a> exported some of Google TV&#39;s best features including a watchlist, recommended tuning and detail pages. Now, it&#39;s the turn of the Google TV app on Android, formerly Play Movies &amp; TV, an all-round entertainment hub for streaming, buying and renting movies and TV shows. Courtesy of a new update, the app is getting a fresh design and a raft of new reality, global and live TV programming.</p><p>As if the branding wasn&#39;t convoluted enough, to make things more complicated the service is only available in the US. For everyone else, there&#39;s the Play Movies &amp; TV app, which is limited to digital downloads.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With that out of the way, let&#39;s take a closer look at the new stuff. In terms of new content, Google is adding programming from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discovery-plus-now-available-roku-amazon-fire-181032400.html">Discovery+</a> and Rakuten&#39;s Asian drama streamer Viki, along with kids&#39; shows from Cartoon Network, PBS kids, and Boomerang and live TV from YouTube TV, Philo and fuboTV.&nbsp;</p><p>A new design, meanwhile, should make deciding what to watch that tad bit easier. Google is emphasising movie and TV shows with 16:9 widescreen posters, below which you can find Rotten Tomatoes scores. The company has also improved its discovery algorithm that matches movie and shows to your tastes. You can put it to the test by scouring the new rows of personalized recommendations, including new sub-genres like sci-fi thrillers and summer blockbusters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-tv-update-android-160044153.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6d9c9772-7944-4476-bd5d-4b91c46200ab</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627382415</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T10:40:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/672bbde0-eec5-11eb-98fe-2fbf74880168" width="2880" height="1800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/672bbde0-eec5-11eb-98fe-2fbf74880168" width="2880" height="1800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pinterest is giving creators ways to make money on the platform]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pinterest influencers might soon be able to make a living directly from the platform. The company has <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/introducing-new-ways-for-creators-to-earn-money-and-partner-with-brands-on-pinterest"><ins>revealed</ins></a> its first set of monetization tools for creators.</p><p>Retailers have added hundreds of millions of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-02-pinterest-buyable-pins.html"><ins>Product Pins</ins></a> on the platform, according to Pinterest. Users who click or tap on the pins can buy those products. Pinterest is now rolling out an option for users to tag <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/pinterest-introduces-idea-pins-globally-and-launches-new-creator-discovery-features"><ins>Idea Pins</ins></a> (its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-launches-story-pins-influencers-130047393.html"><ins>version of other platforms&#39; Stories</ins></a>) with Product Pins.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company says users are 89 percent more likely to be interested in buying an item that&#39;s tagged in Idea Pins than ones they see in Product Pins. That&#39;s perhaps because users can see how their favorite creators are using products and maybe take some inspiration from that. Creators can use affiliate links to receive a cut of sales generated though their Idea Pins.</p><p>Pinterest is adding another feature to Idea Pins — a &quot;paid partnerships&quot; label for creators who share branded content. Influencers who create content on behalf of a company can tag the brand in Idea Pins. Once the brand gives the tag the green light, the label will appear. The aim is to improve transparency and make it easier for creators to disclose paid partnerships.</p><p>“Pinterest is the place where creators with inspiring and actionable ideas get discovered,&quot; Aya Kanai, Pinterest head of content and creator partnerships, said in a statement. &quot;With this latest update, we’re empowering Creators to reach millions of shoppers on the platform and monetize their work. Creators deserve to be rewarded for the inspiration they deliver to their followers, and the sales they drive for brands.&quot;</p><p>Product tagging on Idea Pins will initially be available on business accounts in the US and UK. The feature will hit other markets in the coming months. As for paid partnerships, select Pinterest users in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru now have access.</p><p>Other visually focused platforms are focusing on ways to help influencers earn a living (and, crucially, to dissuade them from moving elsewhere).

Either way, you can see all the threads you’re currently taking part in on the sidebar. When you open a thread from a chat channel log, it will appear in another side panel to the right of the interface so you can follow both conversations at the same time.

These won’t appear in a server’s channel listing, and the only way to take part in one is if someone invites you to the conversation. Boosted channels can also make it so that threads archive up to one week after they’re started, instead of 24 hours after the fact. With the introduction of threads, Discord is also adding new permissions. Channel owners can decide who can take part in both public and private threads and manage them as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Discord is starting the rollout of threads today. Community servers can enable the feature early. On August 17th, however, the company plans to enable threads across all servers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/discord-threads-150018618.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20dac71b-0512-488c-9894-220b3cd4b535</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 15:00:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627398300</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T15:05:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/87fc27b0-eedb-11eb-b1ea-83a48cfa5e6b" width="1600" height="1137" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/87fc27b0-eedb-11eb-b1ea-83a48cfa5e6b" width="1600" height="1137" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Discord]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Discord threads]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Discord threads]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Waze will warn you about traffic jams and detours before you drive]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Waze can be helpful for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-10-waze-esri-live-traffic-data-for-us-cities.html">dodging gridlock</a> and other headaches while you drive, but now it&#39;s helping you make a more informed choice before you start moving.

That should smooth out handheld shooting pretty well, though don&#39;t expect miracles for walk-and-talk type vlogging — especially if rolling sensor wobble proves to be an issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Size-wise, the ZV-E10 is smaller than any of the A6000-series cameras at 343 grams and isn&#39;t much larger and heavier than the ZV-1. It lacks an electronic viewfinder, but it&#39;s Sony&#39;s first APS-C mirrorless camera with a fully-articulating flip-out screen — a basic requirement on any vlogging camera these days.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64212810-eee8-11eb-baff-b61f12e08d82" alt="Sony&#x002019;s ZV-E10 brings interchangeable lenses to its vlogging camera series" data-uuid="e242a174-5557-3063-9622-1bdd40262cda"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The ZV-E10 comes with Sony&#39;s latest phase-detect autofocus system, both for video and still shooting. That means you should get incredibly quick subject tracking, along with reliable eye, face and head detect autofocus. It also has an S&amp;Q (slow &amp; quick) feature that lets you record time-lapse and slow motion footage in-camera without the need for any post processing work.</p><p>It borrows several vlogging features directly from the ZV-1. The first is called &quot;product showcase,&quot; a setting that allows it to instantly focus away from your face and onto an object placed in front of the camera. That&#39;s particularly handy for vloggers reviewing products, devices, etc.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/de3ea450-eee9-11eb-badf-efa54e3b6749" alt="Sony&#x002019;s ZV-E10 brings interchangeable lenses to its vlogging camera series" data-uuid="43426e1f-731f-31f6-b8aa-bd63c22d7c1b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The other is a bokeh switch that instantly sets the lowest f-stop available for lighting conditions. That way, you can have the background as defocused as possible, allowing your subject to stand out clearly.&nbsp;</p><p>The ZV-E10 has a built-in, high-quality three-way microphone (left, right and central channels) that&#39;s designed to pick out your voice. That means you can vlog without the need to buy a microphone, though it still won&#39;t match the quality and voice isolation of a dedicated shotgun or lapel mic.</p><p>It also comes with a  hotshoe-attached muff to help block wind noise, and if that&#39;s not enough, a wind noise reduction setting. If you do plan to use your own microphone, it comes with both mic and headphone inputs, and the hotshoe supports Sony&#39;s dedicated digital, multi-channel microphones.&nbsp;</p><div id="561a7b106b7f491595c32d1e71c4081e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z48-5QGetTE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>As for battery life, Sony claims you can shoot for 80 minutes on a charge or 440 photos. With the small body, it has just a single SD card slot and only supports UHS-I speeds — not ideal for burst photo shooting, but fine for Sony&#39;s relatively low XAVC video data rates.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, if you&#39;re into live streaming, you can connect the ZV-E10 directly to a smartphone via the USB-C port and stream directly to YouTube or other services — much as you can with Panasonic&#39;s latest GH5-II. It will also work directly as a webcam, streaming both video and audio (not just video like other cameras) so you can take advantage of its high-quality microphone.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ZV-E10" href="https://fave.co/3zDUlVC">ZV-E10</a> will be available in either black or white by the end of August and will cost $700 for the body, or $800 in a bundle including Sony&#39;s 16-50mm F/3.5-5.6 power zoom lens.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-expands-its-vlogging-lineup-with-the-zv-e-10-mirrorless-camera-142731045.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">577fe4f2-52a3-44c5-9a74-779ead57cb8f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:27:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627402034</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T16:07:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a768330-eeec-11eb-9fbf-1ce709229319" width="2500" height="1579" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a768330-eeec-11eb-9fbf-1ce709229319" width="2500" height="1579" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony mirrorless ZV-E10]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony mirrorless ZV-E10]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AZIO’s colorful IZO collection looks great (and that’s about it)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With tech pretty much everywhere in our lives these days, some people would prefer it matched their personal style and decor. But sometimes practicality gets left behind, resulting in products that look good but don’t work so well. Here at Engadget, for example, we’ve tested a few fancy keyboards that didn’t offer the best typing experience. But despite our misgivings, these “fashion” keyboards continue to be popular with social media influencers. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:AZIO&#x002019;s new IZO collection" href="https://fave.co/3iBAZJQ">AZIO’s new IZO collection</a>, out this summer, tries to be both fashion forward and functional, and it succeeds — to a point.</p><p>The collection has three main components, all of them wireless: a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:AZIO;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:IZO keyboard" href="https://fave.co/3y10Y3V">$140</a> mechanical keyboard; a $70 number pad that also functions as a standalone calculator; and a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:IZO mouse" href="https://fave.co/2UGPTXk">$50</a> mouse. There’s also a matching wrist rest and desk pad. The items are sold separately, and you can snag them in either white, blue or pink. I opted to receive my review units in “baroque rose” because it really is a nice shade of pink, in contrast to the bubble gum shades favored by companies like Razer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d8204ed0-ebeb-11eb-bf98-a6529571c374" alt="Mouse, keypad, keyboard" data-uuid="d64acaec-1691-3efc-b695-1085ff682358"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Regardless of which color you choose, each accessory is embellished with gold accents The keyboard, media dial, escape key and spacebar are all gilded and glossy. They stand out against the matte plastic used on the rest of the deck, and not in a good way. I also suspect that after several months of use, the coating is going to wear away and it’s not going to be pretty.</p><p>The keys are squircle shaped and lightly textured, so they at least feel nice to the touch. The typing… isn’t horrible. It’s actually perfectly fine, with good tactile bounce and a soft click with every press. But despite the blue mechanical switches it still feels a bit spongy compared to the other decks I have here in my office. I’m typing this hands-on with the IZO and it’s fine, but given a choice I’d switch back to my standards in a heartbeat. The IZO feels like a toy, which is disconcerting when I’m here to work. It’s a tenkeyless deck, which makes it great for tight spaces and taking on the go, though I wouldn’t slip it in my bag for fear of scratching it up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f88d8c00-ebeb-11eb-9edf-cc7ba5a6621b" alt="AZIO IZO keyboard in pink" data-uuid="ea78ee88-f5fa-3c88-98a6-e270d5ef62e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you need a number pad, that’ll cost extra. Seventy dollars is kind of steep for those 18 extra keys, and the fact that it can also be used as a calculator doesn’t make the cost sting any less.I will say this for it, though: I love this thing. Not because I use the number pad to do calculations (though I do), but because it’s just so fun to play with. I don’t have it connected or even turned on right now, I just like to randomly pick it up in both hands and play with the buttons. I may find the typing experience a little subpar, but as a fidget toy the numpad is great because it’s just so chunky and clicky, perfect for keeping my hands busy during boring Zoom calls.</p><p>The final piece of the set is the wireless mouse, the most beautiful of the three desk accessories. It’s a rounded rectangular shape, with a gold scroll wheel and stripe across the middle of the mouse, below which is a frosted white plastic bearing the AZIO logo. This is the kind of mouse that could strut around Milan Fashion Week or the beach at Ibiza. Unfortunately, it’s pretty bad as a computing accessory.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17457810-ebec-11eb-bed7-77d267021af3" alt="AZIO IZO mouse in pink" data-uuid="420226aa-020e-303e-aff5-680eca33dcb8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s the hand feel that’s an immediate turnoff. Where most mice curve inward and down on the end facing the user, the better to fit in your palm, the AZIO mouse is straight all the way down, with the rear of the mouse at the same height as the middle. It’s actually one of the smallest mice I’ve tested, but it feels huge in my hand. That’s a big no-no considering it’s a fashion peripheral, presumably meant to appeal to women, who usually have smaller mitts than men.</p><p>The design faux pas don’t end there, either. The DPI button is placed on the bottom of the mouse and it’s a tiny little nub that’s hard to hit, so once you’ve picked a setting you’ll probably want to stick with it. And the pads on bottom have a little too much friction on them to slide across my desk easily. I probably should use a mouse pad with this thing but I haven’t needed one in almost a decade and I don’t see why I should go back now.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/344c31b0-ebec-11eb-bd7b-d68e796f48c5" alt="AZIO IZO keypad in pink" data-uuid="4bb8ed89-0108-3aec-bc5d-5854cedd0cee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>I wouldn’t recommend the mouse and the cost of the number pad is a bit too steep for me to tell you to buy it — even at the currently discounted price of $40. The keyboard is also on sale for $80, which is a little more tempting. But if the color was your main reason for buying it, note that Logitech’s K380 comes in a fetching pale pink, can connect to up to three devices wirelessly and is only <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech K380" href="https://amzn.to/3kQ9CyC">$40</a>. You also have your choice of mice to match, including the stellar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-anywhere-3-mouse-price-specs-availability-070104068.html">MX Anywhere 3</a>. The IZO collection is for people who absolutely need to have a stylish <em>mechanical</em> keyboard — and even then, you might be better off just buying a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Corsair K70" href="https://amzn.to/2W5yjfS">white deck</a> from a company like Corsair and customizing the LEDs to your favorite shade.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/azio-izo-collection-keyboard-mouse-140016265.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93c84e38-cbe1-4944-956a-df8b2cebbfe0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627395146</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T14:12:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7efbd6c0-eee4-11eb-bfef-2237ad004883" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7efbd6c0-eee4-11eb-bfef-2237ad004883" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kris Naudus / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AZIO IZO keyboard and mouse peripherals photographed on a black cloth background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AZIO IZO keyboard and mouse]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok hopes new tools will create kinder, gentler live streams]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TikTok wants to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-streamlabs-live-streaming-integration-165006138.html">encourage more livestreams</a>, and that now includes creating a friendlier environment for the hosts. The social video giant is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-live-features-2021">rolling out</a> a string of new features that include tools to promote kindness. For a start, TikTok will now pop up an alert if you&#39;re about to post a comment the company deems &quot;potentially unkind or harmful.&quot; You can press forward if you&#39;re determined, but TikTok clearly hopes you&#39;ll reconsider any personal attacks.</p><p>Accordingly, the hosts will have more power as well. You can assign a trusted moderator before you start a stream, letting you focus on the show instead of blocking and muting trolls. You can now add up to 200 entries to the keyword filter. In the &quot;coming weeks,&quot; you&#39;ll also have ways for both hosts and viewers to both delete comments and temporarily mute viewers. Someone who committed a minor offense can have a shot at redemption, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s also a focus on improved discovery. An addition rolling out &quot;soon&quot; will improve your ability to find livestreams from the For You and Following pages, not to mention provider quicker access to top and recommended live videos. TikTok also recently launched a scheduling tool for hosts, picture-in-picture viewing and a &quot;Go Live Together&quot; feature that lets two people start broadcasting at the same time.</p><p>The focus on livestreams doesn&#39;t come as a shock. TikTok noted that the number of people hosting and watching live video had &quot;doubled&quot; over the past year, and some of its biggest events have involved livestreams. The Weeknd played a concert through the platform, for instance. While looping videos remain TikTok&#39;s core, the company is more than a little eager to challenge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-venue-app-second-screen-130026040.html">Facebook</a>, Instagram and other services where live video is also growing in popularity.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-live-stream-kindness-discovery-tools-133912505.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c8adade0-c520-497f-923d-b734e9638b16</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:39:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627392862</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T13:34:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a75479d0-eed8-11eb-adf7-bb0375634715" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a75479d0-eed8-11eb-adf7-bb0375634715" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TikTok]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TikTok livestream comment kindness feature]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TikTok livestream comment kindness feature]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nothing's Ear 1 wireless earbuds arrive on August 17th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Nothing">Nothing</a>, the hardware startup from OnePlus co-founder <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carl-pei-leaving-oneplus-235552807.html">Carl Pei</a>, has officially unveiled its first product: the Ear 1 wireless earbuds.

Netflix actually lost 433,000 subscribers in the US and Canada during its second quarter, while Disney is reportedly <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/disney-u-s-growth-slows-sharply-in-first-half-of-2021-internal-data-shows">struggling</a>, too. But, overseas is another story. Thanks to cheap <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-mobile-edition-bharti-airtel-india-111531193.html">mobile-only</a> plans that cater to local viewing habits, streaming services are making gains in places like Asia. Netflix, which has a low-end tier in India that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-netflix-mobile-only-plans-india.html">costs $2.67</a>, nabbed just over a million subscribers in Asia-Pacific in its latest quarter. Now, Disney is looking to build on its mammoth success in India with its own mobile streaming plan that costs $6.70 per year.</p><p>Having rebranded its local service to Disney+ Hotstar last Spring, the company is introducing three tiers in total. Aside from mobile, which lets you watch on one mobile device in HD, there&#39;s Super for $12.08 per year (two devices including mobile, the web and more in HD) and Premium for $20.14 per year (four devices in 4K). The three plans will come into effect on September 1st, Disney announced at a virtual event, according to <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/news/hotstar-disney-plus-india-plans-new-mobile-super-premium-499-899-1499-year-annual-2495963"><em>NDTV</em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Though it&#39;s the opposite of the single monthly and yearly plan Disney+ offers in the US and elsewhere, the shakeup makes sense for India. Going mobile-only sees the company following a tried and tested model aimed at the large chunk of the local population that use mobiles to connect to the internet. The launch also comes just weeks ahead of Disney&#39;s latest earnings report on August 12th, where all eyes will be on Disney+ subscriber numbers.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-india-mobile-plan-130852534.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02f4d768-0204-4e76-95f2-ccd3c932cebc</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:08:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627391334</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T13:09:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cd3b280-eed7-11eb-aefd-07b5af5acea7" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cd3b280-eed7-11eb-aefd-07b5af5acea7" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SPAIN - 2021/07/08: In this photo illustration, a Disney+ Hotstar logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

With the change, advertisers will no longer be able to use “interests” or information gleaned from other services to show ads to Facebook, Instagram and Messenger’s youngest users.</p><p>The change won’t prevent advertisers from reaching teens at all — they can still use broad demographic information like age, gender, and location — but the update will prevent more granular data from being used, including info from<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-20-facebook-shared-data-controls.html"><ins> third-party</ins></a> websites and apps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instagram is also making several changes to make teens on its platform less visible. The app will begin making new accounts private by default for teens younger than 16, though teens as young as 13 can still opt for a public-facing account if they wish. Instagram said that in early tests “eight out of ten young people accepted the private default settings during sign-up,” suggesting the change could lead more teens to have non-public accounts.</p><p>For teens who do opt for public accounts, Instagram is making it more difficult for adults they don’t know to interact with them in the app. The company says it has “developed new technology” that makes it easier to identify “potentially suspicious behavior” in adults who could pose a risk to teens.</p><p>According to Instagram, adults flagged as “potentially suspicious” will be blocked from following teens or commenting on their posts (the app has previously limited adults ability <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-restricts-adult-dms-to-teens-140416475.html"><ins>to direct message</ins></a> teens). These adults also won’t see content from teens in Reels, Explore and other in-app recommendations. The company isn’t sharing many details about how it determines which adults might be sketchy, but said one factor would be adults who get blocked or reported by younger users.</p><p>The changes come as Instagram is vying for younger users. The company has publicly discussed future plans for a version of its service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faceboo-making-an-instagram-for-children-under-13-053133204.html">for children</a> younger than 13 years old. That idea, which the company has said is in early stages, has already prompted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-letter-instagram-for-kids-200635143.html"><ins>pushback</ins></a> from lawmakers and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-for-kids-pushback-from-us-attorneys-general-155919010.html">other officials</a>. But Facebook is still pushing ahead with the idea. In a separate blog post, the company again said it plans to work with experts in child development and online safety as it creates the service, and that it welcomes &quot;productive collaboration with lawmakers.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-limit-targeted-ads-teens-130055774.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c1210f9a-6711-435b-8e91-9ec1a70feba3</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627346432</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T00:41:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cultural Groups]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b45768e0-ee6f-11eb-afeb-3d64c881ad41" width="4437" height="2958" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b45768e0-ee6f-11eb-afeb-3d64c881ad41" width="4437" height="2958" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DeFodi Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[KIRCHHEIM UNTER TECK, GERMANY - MARCH 09: (BILD ZEITUNG OUT) In this photo illustration, The Facebook and Instagram logos on the screen of an iPhone on March 09, 2021 in Kirchheim unter Teck, Germany.

As the company did with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-master-and-dynamic-mw07-plus-review.html">its MW07 model</a>, another version of the MW08 is making its debut today. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:MW08 Sport" href="https://fave.co/3771O3j">MW08 Sport</a> offers all of the features that make the MW08 so good, including 12-hour battery life, excellent sound quality and improved active noise cancellation (ANC). This new Sport option is made with different materials, has more ear tips in the box and it comes with a wireless charging case. However, the additions tack $50 onto the price.</p><p>Instead of the ceramic and aluminum combo that we saw on the MW08, the MW08 Sport pairs the metal accents with sapphire glass. Master &amp; Dynamic says the new material is scratch and shatter resistant which the company argues gives these earbuds the ability &quot;to withstand any workout.&quot; Like the previous version, the MW08 Sport is IPX5 rated, which means they should withstand a sweat session with no issues. There are also some changes for the MW08 Sport&#39;s charging case. The company&#39;s familiar shiny stainless steel was a fingerprint magnet and it didn&#39;t take much for it to begin showing scratches. That material has been replaced with Kevlar fiber, so the case has a more tactile soft-touch coating with a black and gray pattern. And, of course, it should also be more durable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/74589590-ee7c-11eb-b7fe-98a451dac12b" alt="Master &amp; Dynamic MW08 Sport" data-uuid="05d242b2-0969-30c2-8f43-822de5fb4a67"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Master &amp; Dynamic</div></figure><p>More importantly, the included case now supports wireless charging, which is likely the primary cause for the price increase. As you might expect, Master &amp; Dynamic made its own pad to support this feature, an accessory that will debut alongside the MW08 Sport <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:for $69 (&#x0020ac;69/&#xa3;59)" href="https://fave.co/3zHpKX4">for $69 (€69/£59)</a>. The company says wireless charging for the case itself will give you 50 percent battery in 30 minutes and a full charge will take just over an hour and a half. Compare that to 15 minutes for half or an hour for a full charge with a USB-C cable. Charging times for the earbuds in the case are unchanged from the MW08: 50 percent in 15 minutes and an hour for a complete top off.&nbsp;</p><p>The last big change for the MW08 Sport is the selection of ear tips. Like the MW08, Master &amp; Dynamic gives you five sets of silicone tips to help you find the best fit. For the Sport model, the company is also throwing in two sizes of foam tips that offer a more secure fit for workouts. Based on my experience using the MW08 Sport for the last week, the foam tips are more comfortable than the silicone options too.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/27ccd9b0-ee46-11eb-ab2a-a11a57fae78c" alt="Master &amp; Dynamic MW08 Sport" data-uuid="28c4ccbd-db75-3c1b-9806-372318c1ee4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Master &amp; Dynamic</div></figure><p>Inside, the MW08 Sport is unchanged from the the MW08. The earbuds pack 11mm Beryllium-coated drivers to power their stellar sound. Dual-mode ANC returns, giving you the option of blocking as much of the world as possible (ANC Max) or a setting for &quot;less noisy&quot; spots (All Day ANC). The company&#39;s two ambient sound modes are also back, with one dedicated to conversation and the other suited for more general use. The only bummer here is you still have to choose your ANC and ambient sound mode inside of Mater &amp; Dynamic&#39;s app. The on-board controls don&#39;t cycle between the two, but activate your last selection when you turn on either noise cancellation or ambient mode from the earbuds.</p><p>Battery life is also unchanged, and that&#39;s a good thing. The MW08 Sport offers 12 hours of battery life on the buds themselves with 30 additional hours in the charging case.&nbsp;</p><p>The new materials, additional ear tips and wireless charging bring the cost of the MW08 Sport up to $349. That&#39;s $50 more than the MW08. In addition to black and white colors that are similar to the MW08, navy and green options are available on the MW08 Sport.

The automaker has revealed during its most recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sets-delivery-record-by-building-and-shipping-200000-vehicles-in-q-2-213045738.html">earnings call</a> that it has pushed back the truck&#39;s arrival — yet again — to 2022, three years after its original launch target in 2019. Last year, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-semi-delayed-to-2021-222022916.html">announced</a> that it had to delay the vehicle&#39;s release to 2021 but didn&#39;t elaborate on what prompted the decision and if it was primary due to the pandemic. Now, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/tesla-delays-semi-truck-to-2022-cybertruck-back-burnered-for-model-y/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Tesla told shareholders that the Semi truck will be delayed due to the limited availability of battery cells and global supply chain challenges.</p><p>The whole statement reads:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;We believe we remain on track to build our first Model Y vehicles in Berlin and Austin in 2021. The pace of the respective production ramps will be influenced by the successful introduction of many new product and manufacturing technologies, ongoing supply-chain-related challenges and regional permitting.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To better focus on these factories, and due to the limited availability of battery cells and global supply chain challenges, we have shifted the launch of the Semi truck program to 2022. We are also making progress on the industrialization of Cybertruck, which is currently planned for Austin production subsequent to Model Y.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As <em>TechCrunch</em> notes, Tesla executive Jerome Guillen also left the company in June, just a few months after he started leading the trucking division. While the automaker didn&#39;t say whether his departure was in any way connected to the Semi&#39;s delay, Guillen used to lead Tesla&#39;s entire automotive business until he was made president of the Heavy Trucking unit in March.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-16-tesla-unveils-its-vision-of-the-future-of-trucking.html">announced</a> the Semi back in 2017, promising an electric big rig with a 500-mile range and technologies that include Enhanced Autopilot. It&#39;s been traveling all around the US and has apparently been capable of doing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-26-tesla-semi-truck-travels-cross-country-alone.html">cross-country trips</a> on its own without escorts since 2018, relying entirely on Tesla&#39;s existing Supercharger network. Elon Musk told staff in an internal email last year that the Semi is ready to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-semi-elon-musk-volume-production-153933911.html">enter mass production</a>, but the company&#39;s readiness doesn&#39;t mean anything without the truck&#39;s components.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delays-semi-truck-2022-102502178.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aebfbae8-bdd4-4c79-883d-64c9a87cc12a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 10:25:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627381628</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T10:27:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/65bc1430-eeb8-11eb-9a3f-142d8b690772" width="1600" height="985" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/65bc1430-eeb8-11eb-9a3f-142d8b690772" width="1600" height="985" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's second-gen Echo Buds fall to Prime Day lows at Best Buy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2nd-gen-review-130018884.html">Echo Buds</a> have dropped to below $100 for the first time since Prime Day. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Best Buy" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/P0KePQ">Best Buy</a> is offering the wired charging model of the active noise-canceling earbuds for $80, down from their normal price of $120. If you prefer wireless charging, that particular model is back down to $100, a savings of $40. The Alexa-powered buds were already affordable, but the latest deal could sway those still on the fence. Especially considering that they were only released in April.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Amazon Echo Buds at Best Buy - $80" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/P0KePQ">Buy Amazon Echo Buds at Best Buy - $80</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Amazon Echo Buds (Wireless charging case) at Best Buy - $100" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/e4qyNX">Buy Amazon Echo Buds (Wireless charging case) at Best Buy - $100</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon improved its Echo Buds in all the right places with the second-gen model. With the right tweaks in the Alexa app, you can boost the audio, and take full advantage of the big bass, courtesy of that new 5.7mm high-performance driver. Amazon&#39;s digital assistant can also complete a range of tasks, from firing up music and podcasts to setting reminders and even fetching transit info for some US cities.</p><p>The overhaul also extends to the design. Both the earbuds and the charging case are 20 percent and 40 percent smaller, respectively. At this price, however, you can expect some cutbacks. One of the few areas that remains the same is the battery life, which offers five hours overall and two hours from just a 15-minute charge. The only other shortcoming is that the buds don&#39;t always block out noisy backgrounds on calls. But, with a little in-app customization, you can crank up your voice to help overcome that.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-deal-092943719.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3b7bcfc-812b-488e-bc6e-6c5433dce439</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 09:29:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627386161</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T11:43:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/61522d90-eebc-11eb-ae5d-8c005fc10918" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/61522d90-eebc-11eb-ae5d-8c005fc10918" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Echo Buds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Echo Buds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel will build chips for Qualcomm as part of its ambitious foundry plans]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, Intel unveiled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html">detailed plans</a> for its future chip technology, describing how it plans to catch rivals TSMC and Samsung by 2025.

Samsung thinks it has an answer. The company will start taking pre-orders for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2021-tv-lineup-availability-150003304.html">long-teased</a> Odyssey Neo G9 display on July 29th for $2,500. Yes, you could buy a nice PC for less than the cost of this curved, 49-inch beast — although you might have good reasons to buy this over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-gaming-monitor-odyssey-g-7-28-4-k-144-hz-084535416.html">smaller, flatter</a> Odyssey screens.</p><p>As you might have guessed, the use of mini-LED delivers very high contrast ratios for an LCD monitor. Samsung claims a black level of just 0.0004. However, you&#39;re also getting extremely bright HDR thanks to a peak brightness of 2,000 nits that makes many TVs seem dim by comparison. Customizable lighting effects help add to the flash.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You should also see the same 5,120 x 1,440 resolution, 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms pixel response time from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-curved-gaming-monitors-us-prices-120014874.html">last year&#39;s Odyssey G9</a>, not to mention connectivity that includes two HDMI ports, DisplayPort and a pair of USB 3.0 connections.</p><p>You&#39;re clearly getting features that are hard to match. However, it&#39;s also apparent that Samsung is targeting a fairly narrow audience — The Neo G9 is meant for well-heeled gamers who want the most immersive non-VR experience possible. It could easily hit the sweet spot if you&#39;re in that demographic, but creative pros (and anyone on a budget) will probably want to look elsewhere.</p><div id="aa9477bf83e74f7498b24436f6701912"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKH1VUFCS-w?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-price-pre-order-020000540.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3fc3f15-25fd-4b55-ac78-3360ba194e75</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627309360</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T14:22:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/675f0c80-ee0d-11eb-af77-b9881b362301" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/675f0c80-ee0d-11eb-af77-b9881b362301" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 mini-LED curved gaming monitor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 mini-LED curved gaming monitor]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
