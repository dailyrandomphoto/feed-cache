Specifically, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-lioness-2-ai-orgasm-vibrator-data-collection-ces-2020.html">Lioness smart vibrator</a>, which gathers bio-data like body temperature and pelvic pressure. Liemhetcharat said she was partly inspired by the <a href="https://perifit.co">Perifit</a> kegel exerciser, which also uses games and a device to help people strengthen their pelvic floor. The game, an endless runner called <em>You Are What You Eat</em>, has been in beta since then. Today, Liemhetcharat has released the Android version, which you can now <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AtasFun.YouAreWhatYouEatLioness">download from the Google Play Store</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Liemhetcharat told Engadget that <em>You Are What You Eat</em> is based on her family&#39;s favorite activity. &quot;Our running joke is that we eat everything,&quot; she said. By itself, the game is an endless runner, with the objective of eating as many creatures as possible before dying. You begin as a blob, then grow and morph depending on what you ingest. That will also affect what you can continue to consume, as some creatures will subsequently become &quot;inedible&quot; based on what you&#39;ve become. A <a href="https://allisonliem.org/youarewhatyoueat/lioness_1d28/">WebGL version of the game</a> is available.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8da3b4d368e64ed1beffa37dbc2ebf8c"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTmYVeCyw2I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>But for those who own the Lioness smart vibrator, you can use it to control your slimeball. Squeeze the dildo&#39;s head (where the pressure sensors are) to jump, and do that twice to fly or jump twice. The device will also vibrate in response when you do those things or eat something.</p><p>Those on iOS won&#39;t be left out — Liemhetcharat told Engadget that a version for the iPhone is coming soon, too. So far, the game itself is simple, but the most intriguing aspect is its use of the bio-sensing vibrator as a controller. As a proof of concept, <em>YAWYE</em> is fairly straightforward, though we&#39;ll have to wait for medical professionals to weigh in before we can say with any certainty if it can be helpful in strengthening pelvic floor muscles.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/you-are-what-you-eat-lioness-smart-vibrator-game-223046404.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83c794f4-5357-4d65-abf7-ba42ffb6e19b</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 22:30:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642717847</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T22:31:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e63ad8a0-7a3e-11ec-affb-5634e936248e" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e63ad8a0-7a3e-11ec-affb-5634e936248e" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Allison Liemhetcharat]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot from the game "You Are What You Eat" featuring some trees, two pink creatures on the bottom left and the words "This creature has ears, so you will grow ears when you eat it" at the top.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[You Are What You Eat game screenshot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA's Swift Observatory may have suffered an attitude control failure]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-fast-radio-burst-in-milky-way-002145743.html">Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory</a> has run into difficulties after 17 years of largely smooth service.

However, it has increasingly been used as a catch-all observer across multiple wavelengths, spotting solar flares and hard-to-find stars.

They not only have to measure their blood glucose levels and inject the right amount of insulin, but carry all the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-apple-diabetes-products-in-stores.html">relevant equipment</a> with them. MIT and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital researchers might soon eliminate many of the headaches, though. They&#39;re <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/all-one-diabetes-insulin-0120">developing</a> all-in-one devices (not pictured) that measure glucose, calculate the necessary insulin dose and inject you accordingly.</p><p>The first device includes the blood-drawing lancet, glucose test strips and an insulin needle. Users would first take a photo of their meal using a smartphone app to estimate the food volume and carbohydrate levels. After that, they&#39;d start the automated process of collecting blood, calculating glucose (again through the app) and delivering the appropriate amount of insulin.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The second gadget would only need one needle jab — it would build the glucose sensor into the insulin needle and inject the appropriate amount of insulin. You&#39;d have to wait five to ten seconds, but you wouldn&#39;t have to stick yourself twice.</p><p>The technology is still some ways off. While the first device would use parts that were already FDA-approved, it hasn&#39;t been tested in humans. The second, meanwhile, uses a new sensor type that will likely require more work to be testable with humans. Scientists have filed patents for both devices and are hoping to work with companies on further development.</p><p>There&#39;s a strong motivation to bring these devices to market, at least. People with diabetes would only need to use one device at meals, and with the hybrid sensor/needle might suffer less pain. That, in turn, could encourage consistent treatment that improves your overall wellbeing.</p><div id="0ec4baba0b224944b492478db00574c7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMSgdLa4aYs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-diabetes-device-blood-glucose-insulin-injection-205524756.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1005f400-8d26-4493-85cc-2f2beb0eae69</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 20:55:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642716081</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T22:01:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Diabetes]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f024cea0-7a27-11ec-97d7-a1c076c0aef1" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f024cea0-7a27-11ec-97d7-a1c076c0aef1" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JGalione via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Woman wearing a glucose sensor checking her blood sugar level using a smartphone app. Tottori, Japan]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Woman wearing a glucose sensor checking her blood sugar level using a smartphone app]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok joins Instagram in testing creator subscriptions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Soon after Instagram started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creator-subscriptions-test-193856198.html"><ins>rolling out paid subscriptions</ins></a> for creators, TikTok says it may be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/tiktok-begins-testing-support-for-paid-subscriptions/"><ins>following suit</ins></a>.

In a call with reporters, Facebook’s Global IO Threat Intelligence Lead, Ben Nimmo, said that it’s not the first time the company has caught Iran-linked fake accounts targeting Scotland, but that the latest network stood out for its “artisanal” approach to the fake personas.</p><p>“What was unique about this case was the effort that the operators took to make their fakes look like real people,” Nimmo said. He noted the accounts spent considerable time posting about their “side interests,” like football, in an attempt to boost their credibility. Some of the accounts also lifted profile photos from real celebrities or media personalities, and regularly updated the images in order to appear more real. Other accounts used fake photos generated by AI programs.</p><p>Overall, Facebook says that the fake accounts weren’t particularly successful as the most popular account had only reached about 4,000 followers, about half of whom were actually located in the UK. “In a way, this is more like an old fashioned pre-internet influence operation, creating detailed fake personas and trying not to be noticed,” Nimmo said.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-cib-report-iran-scotland-fake-accounts-190006227.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">524815a0-2635-4906-b429-b55cc8b646b5</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642707869</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T19:44:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/22b22620-7a22-11ec-b54e-36d4444a3caa" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/22b22620-7a22-11ec-b54e-36d4444a3caa" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this photo illustration a Facebook logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen with a computer keyword in the background in Athens, Greece on January 18, 2022.

Senators Mike Lee, John Cornyn, Ben Sasse, Tom Cotton, Thom Tillis, and Marsha Blackburn <a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1484225457834926082?cxt=HHwWhIC9zZXMg5kpAAAA">all voted against it</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2992/text">The American Innovation and Choice Online Act</a>, which was sponsored by Senator Amy Klobuchar, would prohibit Amazon from promoting its own Amazon Basics gear over similar products in search results. Similarly, Apple and Google would be barred from pushing their in-house apps over those from third-party developers in their respective app stores. The bill passed out of both the antitrust subcommittee and the primary judiciary committee with the support of that vote and will now be put forth on the Senate floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unsurprisingly, the platforms impacted by these proposed regulations are none too pleased with the recent proceedings. Apple&#39;s Tim Cook <a href="https://macdailynews.com/2022/01/18/apple-ceo-tim-cook-personally-lobbying-against-the-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act/">has reportedly been personally lobbying against the bill</a> while <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-statement-on-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act">Amazon has released the following statement</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There’s a reason why small businesses who sell on Amazon are asking Congress to take a look at the “collateral damage” that will fall on them and their customers, should the American Innovation and Choice Online Act become law. This bill is being rushed through the legislative process without any acknowledgment by its authors of its unintended consequences. As drafted, the bill’s vague prohibitions and unreasonable financial penalties—up to 15% of U.S. revenue, not income—would jeopardize our ability to allow small businesses to sell on Amazon. The bill would also make it difficult for us to guarantee one or two-day shipping for those small businesses&#39; products—key benefits of Amazon Prime for sellers and customers alike. The bill’s authors are targeting common retail practices and, troublingly, appear to single out Amazon while giving preferential treatment to other large retailers that engage in the same practices. We urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject Senator Klobuchar and Senator Grassley’s bill and refuse to rush through an ambiguously worded bill with significant unintended consequences.</p></blockquote><p>A similar bill has already passed the judiciary committee&#39;s counterpart in the House though the President has not yet weighed in regarding his support of these proposals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senator-klobuchars-major-tech-reform-bill-advances-out-of-committee-185350924.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">476e5438-b427-487c-961c-307dc355c459</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:53:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642715900</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T21:58:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f02c7fb0-7a3b-11ec-bf37-ae6fc87697a9" width="3000" height="1943" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f02c7fb0-7a3b-11ec-bf37-ae6fc87697a9" width="3000" height="1943" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ELIZABETH FRANTZ via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Senator Klobuchar sits behind a microphone at an official hearing.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Senator Klobuchar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New 'Wallace & Gromit' and 'Chicken Run' movies are coming to Netflix]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a hiatus of more than a decade, the world’s favorite fictitious British inventor (or possibly second after Q from James Bond) and his lovable canine sidekick are making a comeback.

Gone are the days of the beloved CZ series, while the current lineup lacks the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-04-casio-and-the-sleng-teng-riddim.html">lo-fi charm</a> of classic keyboards like the SK-1 and VL-1. But for the last few weeks the company has been <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/casio-new-synth-2022">teasing</a> what seemed like a return to real-deal synths, possibly with a <a href="https://musictech.com/news/gear/casios-new-aix-powered-synth-could-feature-a-vocoder-too/">vocoder</a>.</p><p>Well, bad news: The <a href="https://www.casiomusicgear.com/products/casiotone-series/ct-s1000v">CT-S1000V</a> is not a return to Casio’s analog glory days. Nor is it a vocoder. And the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$450" href="https://fave.co/3fFU38P">$450</a> list price is a little hard to swallow.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="undefined"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nassE9xtaXc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>So what exactly is the CT-S1000V? It looks like a midrange Casiotone that uses the company’s flagship AiX engine, with vocal synthesis tossed in as a bonus. In short, it’s a singing keyboard. Frankly, the novelty of being able to whip up some lyrics in the companion app, send them to the CT-S1000V, and then play the words as a melody was more than enough to pique my interest. I’m a sucker for vocoders, over-the-top autotune and talkboxes, so a singing synth is right up my alley.</p><p>Before we dig too far into the vocal synthesis side of things, let’s quickly cover the AiX engine and the hardware. AiX made its debut in 2018 and its strength supposedly lies in recreating acoustic sounds. And look, credit where credit is due: The piano sounds on this are pretty decent. Can I say the same about the other acoustic instruments represented here, like violins, guitars or trumpets? No. But there are enough quality sounds, including some recreations of classic Casio synth tones, to keep you entertained for a while.</p><p>Don’t come to the S1000V expecting a truly customizable synth, though. While there are some tweaks that you can make, this is not the keyboard for someone looking to learn synthesis or get into sound design. That should be immediately obvious, however, when you look at its front panel. The controls are minimal. Physically it has much more in common with the $250 <a href="https://fave.co/3InF5k1">CT-S400</a> than it does with the $480 <a href="https://fave.co/3qNwxNz">CT-X5000</a> (the closest Casio has to a traditional synth).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb83c70-7a18-11ec-a674-7ba39da5099e" alt="Casiotone CT-S1000V" data-uuid="1f20bb69-53dc-3970-b6b2-b8ac5b470412"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>I haven’t played a modern Casio in some time, but I do have to say, the speaker system is impressive. Because the CT-S1000V is clearly aimed at budding pianists and home entertainment, being self-contained is a huge plus. While the built-in speakers on other keyboards often seem like an afterthought, Casio clearly put effort into them here. When you switch over to the drum and rhythm presets, it’s really quite shocking how much bass you get from the kicks.</p><p>On the whole, the CT-S1000V feels well built. It’s plasticky and the full-sized keys are a tad springy, but it feels solid and the click wheel that serves as your primary tool for navigating the interface is satisfying. Casio did make some strange decisions, though. For instance, the mod knob above the pitch wheel. Mod wheels and mod strips? Sure. But a mod knob? In this configuration, where the placement would suggest it’s a performance tool, seems <em>very </em>odd.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb7c741-7a18-11ec-abcf-29f7ddc464f8" alt="Casiotone CT-S1000V" data-uuid="fc4de7ae-6f53-354d-ac85-2e894cdd7533"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The keyboard also comes with a Bluetooth adapter in the box, but it can only be used for streaming audio and MIDI data. It can’t connect to the companion Lyric Creator app. There are no dedicated MIDI ports on the back and, while it can supposedly be used for MIDI over USB I was unable to get it to work. There are, however, two pedal inputs on the back (one of which can be used for expression), plus ¼-inch stereo audio outs and ⅛-inch jacks for audio in and headphones. There’s also a pair of USB ports: one USB-A specifically for the Bluetooth adapter and a micro-USB (sigh) connector for transferring lyrics from the app on your phone.</p><p>The app is very well designed and thorough, and lyric transfers over USB using a camera kit adapter with my aging iPhone X were almost instantaneous. Casio says transfer over Bluetooth isn’t supported because it would simply be too slow, but just having it as an option would be nice.</p><p>In the app you can either type out or dictate phrases and it will do its best to automatically parse the text. Your mileage may vary, though. Computers aren’t always the best at reproducing human pronunciation and the CT-S1000V is no different. For example, “Engadget” was automatically broken down as “en-gadget”. But when the keyboard sang it back, it became “engage.” I had to go in and manually tweak the lyric to be “En-gad-jet” for it to sound right.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb81560-7a18-11ec-accf-745c2d5407ec" alt="Casiotone CT-S1000V" data-uuid="d4e8d6de-6ab3-353d-9fe2-12ee2417cdd5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>You can really dive deep and customize the phonemes if you want, and punch in specific timings using standard music notation. But there’s no avoiding the fact that getting lyrics to sound right requires a lot of trial and error, which would be less of an issue if you could preview the rendered vocals on your phone before transferring them to the keyboard. Right now it’s just a lot of back and forth.</p><p>On the keyboard itself, you have two primary ways of playing back lyrics: Either in Phrase mode or in Note mode as individual syllables. The former will play back the words using the timing you programmed in. As long as you&#39;re holding keys down, it will sing the lyrics to you. The one issue here is that playback will start over from the beginning if you ever let go of the keys. With syllable playback you have more control over timing and it’s a bit easier to knock out a melody (at least for someone like me who can’t really play piano). But it’s still important that your syllables be broken down just right or the timing will be off when you try to play back a vocal lick.</p><p>There are 22 different voices for you to pick between that range from synthetic choirs, to demonic growls, to talkbox emulations. Some of them get pretty same-sounding, but the variety is welcome. There are a few ways to tweak the voices, including changing the “age” and “gender”, though they dramatically alter the core tone of each.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6d65f6bcd662452b9604e0439139710a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb83c71-7a18-11ec-9bef-0a1b59de16b2" alt="Casiotone CT-S1000V"></section><p>One last feature worth mentioning is the S1000V’s sampling capabilities. There are two different sampling modes: melody and drum. The latter lets you assign samples to individual keys to create custom drum kits. It’s also probably the easiest of the sampling methods to use. Melody, on the other hand, lets you play back a single sample chromatically across the keyboard by slowing it down or speeding it up. This latter trick is a fun and simple way to create custom instruments, and it’s part of what gave Casio’s SK series its charm.</p><p>But it’s worth noting that the sampling process here is slightly more cumbersome than on those old-school instruments. There’s no dedicated sampling controls on the front, you have to do a little menu diving. And there’s no built-in microphone for quick and dirty recording, you need to use the ⅛-inch jack around back, or a Bluetooth connection. It’s a nice tool to have, but I do wish it were featured more prominently and the interface a little less obtuse.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb7c740-7a18-11ec-adf6-4f0f8ee63f52" alt="Casiotone CT-S1000V" data-uuid="724e0a88-1a44-3c94-b469-4c58dfdcfb8b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Casio deserves credit for doing something somewhat unique in building a singing keyboard. Sure, it’s a bit gimmicky to type out (or dictate) your favorite song and then play it back using a synthesized choir. But it’s undeniably fun. And including the ability to record custom samples, and layer them with the keyboard’s built-in sounds is a welcome feature.</p><p>It’s hard to overlook the $450 price, though, especially considering the limited sound design controls. The CT-S1000V is probably best suited for someone learning to play piano who wants a <em>fun</em> keyboard with a bit of versatility to practice on. But its price is a bit steep for what feels like mid-range Casiotone. You can get a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-sp-404-mkii-hands-on-dragging-an-iconic-sampler-into-the-modern-age-070043439.html">more capable sampler</a> for around the same price, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-microfreak-vocoder-synthesizer-limited-edition-220640296.html">Arturia&#39;s MicroFreak</a> delivers limited vocal synthesis and a real vocoder for less. Obviously, the Casio has advantages over those — quality built-in speakers, expansive full-sized keyboard — but you&#39;ll have to decide how much those features are worth in terms of tradeoffs and price.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/casio-casiotone-ct-s1000v-fun-singing-keyboard-hands-on-181016051.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5c5c422e-f9b8-4ce5-a4b7-fa98bec236d5</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:10:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642702252</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T18:11:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb6dce0-7a18-11ec-9ea7-eb94118ac2b7" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb6dce0-7a18-11ec-9ea7-eb94118ac2b7" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Casiotone CT-S1000V]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Casiotone CT-S1000V]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AR and VR hardware sales more than doubled in the US this holiday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Virtual (and augmented) reality appear poised to take off after years of modest demand.

This new hardware is a technical marvel, packing many of the features that most wrist-worn devices take for granted. But the need to keep the cash rolling in has seen Oura, like Fitbit, Apple, Wahoo and others, pivot to a recurring-revenue model. Oura says that this is key to shift from the idea of buying a device that never changes, to supporting its broader goals of building an evolving fitness ecosystem.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0b903560-7944-11ec-b9fe-61535a9da23e" alt="Image of the inside of the Oura Ring (v3)" data-uuid="720b286c-d652-32d0-8275-defe9e2508b5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Before we get into the specifics of this new Oura ring, let’s take a moment to remember that this device is still a marvel of engineering. Taking the sensors from a smartwatch or fitness tracker and shrinking them into a ring is worthy of enormous praise. For all of its imperfections, it’s amazing to see Oura push the limits of what is capable in such a small form factor. And there’s much more tech crammed in this time around, despite the size and weight remaining the same as the second-generation version. The headline features these new sensors enable include continuous heart-rate tracking, temperature monitoring, blood oxygenation and period prediction.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The sizing process is the same for pretty much every smart ring I’ve ever tried: The company sends you a set of plastic dummy rings you have to wear for a couple of days. Once you’ve determined the correct fit, which is tight and secure around the base of your index finger, but not to the point where it’s uncomfortable, you can order the real thing. This actually was the most stressful part of this review, since I felt that one size was too loose, the other too tight, but I opted for looseness rather than sacrificing a digit to the gods of fitness tracking. Oura says that the index finger is the best place for its ring, but you can stick it elsewhere if you prefer.</p><p>Unfortunately, the one thing you can’t do much about is the size of the ring itself which is a bit too big. I’m a big-ish guy with big-ish hands, but it feels a bit too ostentatious on my fingers, enough that people notice and ask me what it is as soon as they spot it. If you have more slender hands, I’m sure you might have a similar issue with folks pointing it out. I suspect that the smart thing to do is visit <a href="https://www.instagram.com/partsof4/">Parts Of 4</a> to get some more adornments to balance out the look.</p><h2>Software</h2><p>Without a screen, Oura is yoked tightly to the iOS or Android app where all of this data will be displayed. The Oura app is clean and tidy, only giving you the deepest data when you go looking for it. The app breaks down all of the information generated from your finger and compresses it into three scores, which are shown on the homescreen. These are for Readiness, Sleep and Activity, representing how prepared you are to face the day, how well-rested you are and how much exercise you’re doing.</p><p>The only other thing you’ll find on the homescreen is a breakdown of your heart rate across the day, showing you where the peaks and troughs are. You’ll also get advice on your ideal bedtime, which is useful when you’re working late nights and need to juggle sleep with getting things done. You’ll also get periodic reminders to move if the app detects you’ve been still for a while, and advice when it’s time for you to wind down for the day.</p><p>Go into one of the categories, like Readiness, and you’ll get scores for your recovery index, sleep, as well as your HRV balance, body temperature and resting heart rate. You can also see that my figures dropped quite substantially during a three-day period when I got food poisoning from a New Year’s Eve takeaway meal. During that period, I was given plenty of warnings telling me I wasn’t rested or well enough to do much else – not that I felt like I was gonna go for a run or anything.</p><p>As part of Oura’s plan to add extra value to its platform, the company is adding a series of video and audio guides for meditation, breathwork and sleeping. These guides, which are essentially guided meditation audio tracks, can be backed with a white noise option of your choice. You can pick the hum of a train station, the crunch of a forest stroll, the sound of the tide lapping at the land or rainfall, amongst others. These are a thing for people who find those things useful to fall asleep and feel restful but I, personally, do not find them that great.</p><p>That said, where Oura differs from its rivals in this space is that it’ll break down your vital signs during your meditation. If you’re wondering how to get better at meditating then you’ll be guided to more appropriate tracks that’ll help prod you toward nirvana.</p><p>Oura is working on adding more features to the Ring v3 over the next year, including more content as well as more accurate sleep and period tracking. These will not actually appear as new features so much as they are behind-the-scenes improvements in the underlying systems. Finally, at some point this year, the ring will be able to identify your blood oxygenation (SpO2) while you sleep in order to help detect disorders like sleep apnea.</p><h2>In use</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/526ac9f0-7944-11ec-97ff-4f9abb1a59bd" alt="Image of the Oura Ring V3 on its charging plate." data-uuid="4b370404-2a61-3ced-a04c-6866f66a1208"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The best thing about the Oura ring is that, once you’ve worn it a few days, you quickly start to ignore its presence. And while you’re not paying attention, it begins worming its way into every corner of your life, learning your working patterns and getting ready to make helpful suggestions. If you feel like crap in the morning but don’t have the mental wherewithal to comprehend why, you’ll be told as soon as you look at your phone. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing here that other platforms don’t do as well, but this is certainly an elegant implementation of the idea.</p><p>Sleep tracking is generally fine, by which I mean it works by tracking movement and therefore can’t tell when you’ve been rudely awoken but haven’t moved. As part of this new pivot, however, Oura is promising that the sleep tracking will soon become vastly more accurate as a consequence of behind-the-scenes changes. This will not be readily visible to users, however, since all you’ll get is a pop-up telling you that things just got more accurate. Still, it offers a fairly good indicator for how the night went, although I find the activity tracking to be a little more on the generous side. Yesterday morning, for instance, it told me that my morning shower was a strength training workout with plenty of burned calories for my trouble. Similarly, it’ll tell me around lunchtime that I need to take a half-hour brisk walk to finish my activity for the day, and then by early evening, having done nothing more than stand at my desk, make dinner and put my kids to sleep, it’ll tell me I’ve completed my goal.</p><p>One of the features that Oura is tempting its users with is Workout Heart Rate, which I find inadvertently amusing. Because the ring is so chunky, and it has such a hard edge, that I really don’t find it comfortable to wear during workouts. For instance, if I’ve got a pair of free weights, or I’m doing an incline push up on a Smith machine bar, the ring just pushes into the fleshy parts of my hand. For most of the proper “gym” workouts I’ve done, the ring has had to come off, lest I tap out too early or draw blood from the chubby parts of my fingers. But for more ring-friendly jobs, like running, walking, or cycling, you should find this to be a big help.</p><p>In terms of vital-signs tracking accuracy, I think it’s always wise to remember that wearables will not be as inch-perfect as a clinical-grade device. But in a number of random spot-tests, the Oura offered the exact same figures as the Apple Watch on my wrist. In fact, Oura’s reputation for accuracy has always been pretty high, and one of the reasons that the company hasn’t released some of these features is to ensure they’re ready to go when they do arrive.</p><p>Oura quotes battery life at seven days, although I rarely managed to get past five without having to drop it on the charging plate. Certainly, real-world stamina is a bit far from what the company is saying, but then it’s hardly a deal breaker since you can charge it full in two hours. It’s become common for me to take the ring off while I’m standing at my desk on Monday and Friday mornings and let it re-juice while I’m working.</p><h2>Economics</h2><p>The third-generation Oura ring will set you back $299, which gets you the ring in one of four finishes: Silver, Black, Stealth or Gold. In the box, you’ll receive the charging plate and a USB-C cable, and as part of the deal, you’ll get a six-month trial of Oura’s subscription service. Membership, which costs $5.99 a month for new users, will entitle you to “daily health insights,” “personalized recommendations,” as well as more video and audio sessions. Any existing Oura user who upgrades to the new ring will get a lifetime membership thrown in for free.</p><p>I want to be fair here and say that I understand why Oura is pivoting to this recurring revenue model. It’s not as if other companies in this space, like Fitbit, aren’t doing the same in the hope of bolstering their bottom lines. And that’s before we get to talk about how much lock-in the Apple Watch gets as a consequence of Fitness+. But I also think there’s a difference between the sort of product that those rivals are offering compared to Oura’s product.</p><p>After all, Apple and Fitbit can both offer coaching both on their devices and on bigger screens, which Oura can’t. Not to mention that Oura is really only able to offer guided audio clips (and short videos) through its app. And that while Apple and Fitbit are selling their devices as (having the potential to become) Capital-F Fitness gear, the Oura really isn’t. But, then again, that’s not what Oura is pitching here – it’s for the meditator, the runner, the cyclist, who doesn’t want to strap something beefy to their wrist.</p><h2>Wrap-Up</h2><p>Here’s the problem with reviewing Oura: It’s not a device that every fitness person will love. If you want something with more versatility, you’d buy a smartwatch and have done with it. Oura is more of a subtle product, for people who want to be less ostentatious about their health, or simply want something that slips into their lives and does the job. Honestly, since I’m not a gym bro, I really like the data the ring offers me without any fuss or muss.</p><p>As for the subscription, it’s likely that Oura will have to keep squeezing as many new features and insights as possible out of this new hardware. Between that, and vastly improving its currently slender content library, it’s worth it if you’re a paid-up member of the Oura family. But, and this is more a comment on the industry as a whole rather than a slight against Oura itself, I do find this need for every company to squeeze some rental income out of their users to be a little bit grating.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oura-ring-version-3-150032257.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4bfda2b-579a-4214-89c2-7c226573a354</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 15:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642692415</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T15:27:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd04bf00-7a03-11ec-994f-a73647b31fc8" width="1844" height="1157" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd04bf00-7a03-11ec-994f-a73647b31fc8" width="1844" height="1157" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Oura Ring V3 displayed on someone's finger with their hand palm-down on a table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oura Ring V3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[What we bought: A rice cooker whose greatest trick isn't actually rice]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Every month, Engadget features what our editors are currently into, whether it be </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-squadrons-vr-campaign-scoping-irl-153054256.html"><em>video games</em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-were-listening-to-mockery-manor-podcast-140004760.html"><em>podcasts</em></a><em> or gadgets. These are not official reviews; they’re simply our first-hand experiences. This week, Senior Editor Nicole Lee gives her take on the Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker.</em></p><hr><p>A long-standing joke among my family and friends over the past couple of decades is that I’m not a true Asian. Why? Because I didn’t have a rice cooker. Since rice is a staple of the Asian diet, rice cookers are commonplace in most Asian households. But for years, I refused to get one. That is, until recently, when I finally gave in and got a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:$198 Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker" href="https://amzn.to/33pJZyk">$195 Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker</a>. And ironically, what I ended up liking most about it isn’t rice at all.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The reason I held off was mostly that I didn’t think I needed it. Since I only live with my husband, I told myself I didn’t need a single-purpose appliance. After all, I could already make rice on the stove with just a saucepan. I’ve become adept at making small portions of rice over the years. Plus, it only takes 18-or-so minutes. A rice cooker, on the other hand, can typically take 35 minutes or longer. So even though I enjoy rice enough to make it regularly, I just couldn’t quite justify the seeming inconvenience.</p><p>This, however, was challenged over this past winter break. We had our family over on Christmas Eve, so I ordered takeout from a local Chinese restaurant. At one point, we ran out of rice, so I set about making more on the stove. I had to make rice for around 10 people, which I’m not used to doing. Long story short, my calculations were off, and the rice I made ended up crunchier than I would like. Of course, my family didn’t complain, but I was still a little upset with myself. That’s when I reconsidered getting a dedicated rice cooker.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/474c7f90-7990-11ec-9bd3-8c1203b5fecb" alt="Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker" data-uuid="216cf6c5-2664-34df-bc7c-f90612147a83"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>After some research, I opted for the Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker. Sure it’s expensive – you can easily get <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:basic models for less than $50" href="https://amzn.to/3GLpzxP">basic models for less than $50</a> – but I wanted one that can cook all kinds of rice such as short-grain and medium-grain white rice, long-grain jasmine rice, sweet (or sticky) rice, brown rice and more. More importantly, I wanted a cooker with “fuzzy logic” (yes, that’s an industry term), which essentially means that the device has a computer chip. This gives it the smarts to adjust temperature and cook time to accommodate other variables, such as human error (like what I experienced over Christmas), to ensure perfectly cooked rice every time.</p><p>I’ve now had it for a few weeks, and I love it. It really does make cooking rice so much easier. Instead of having to fuss over the stove, I can just rinse the rice, add water, push a button and walk away. It also has a “Keep Warm” function that lasts over five hours, giving me plenty of time to prepare dinner as the rice cooks. It also comes with a handy guide that tells you the proper rice and water ratio for all the different kinds of rice. On top of that, it has a timer so you can have the rice ready whenever you want it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b09af6c0-7990-11ec-b3dd-5ab838673902" alt="Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker" data-uuid="780de57b-d3f6-380b-86a5-48a719d45b89"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>But I’d argue the killer function of the Neuro Fuzzy isn’t rice at all. I’ve discovered that it actually makes amazing oatmeal from steel-cut oats. I learned about this from an NYT Cooking recipe for “<a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019528-rice-cooker-steel-cut-oats">Rice Cooker Steel-Cut Oats</a>,” (link requires subscription) and it is really such a game changer for me. Steel-cut oatmeal usually takes 20 or so minutes to make, and I don’t usually have time for it in the mornings. But with the rice cooker, I just dump in one cup of oats followed by four cups of water and a teaspoon of salt before I go to bed, set the timer for 8AM, toggle the menu to the Porridge setting, press Cook, and I get to wake up to fresh oatmeal every morning. What’s more, the resulting oatmeal is the best I’ve ever had. The texture is so creamy and smooth, making it the perfect vehicle for both sweet and savory applications. I like mine with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CYZybe9vS3N/">spam, spinach and furikake</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, and it admittedly sounds silly to talk about a rice cooker this way, but the Neuro Fuzzy is just <em>adorable</em>. Its long oval shape gives it a rounded, egg-like appearance that I find aesthetically pleasing. It also plays a tune whenever it starts or ends cooking. My favorite design feature, however, is its power cord: it’s retractable! This way you can store it away without a nest of cables to contend with.</p><p>Perhaps the only real downside of the Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker is that it’s pretty slow. White rice takes around 40 or so minutes to cook, while brown rice can take 90 minutes or longer (stovetop timing on the other hand, ranges from 18 minutes for white rice to 45 minutes or so for brown rice). Still, that’s a small price to pay for perfectly cooked rice, creamy morning oatmeal and, hopefully, no more ruined Christmases.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zojirushi-neuro-fuzzy-rice-cooker-irl-144543841.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">72c15ce3-be63-4960-baca-0114428b1fd4</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:45:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642695226</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T16:14:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[US International News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/805a5d20-7990-11ec-bced-3e1baea8896f" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/805a5d20-7990-11ec-bced-3e1baea8896f" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy rice cooker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why airlines and telecoms are fighting over the 5G rollout]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rollouts of new wireless technologies and standards have not always gone well. When the GSM system debuted, it <a href="https://www.rcrwireless.com/19950724/archived-articles/gsm-hearing-aid-debate-ignites-into-war">caused hearing aids to buzz and pop with static</a> while early cell phone signals would <a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/cell-phones/magnets-cell-phones-and-smart-watches-may-affect-pacemakers-and-other-implanted-medical-devices">occasionally disrupt pacemakers</a>. Today, as carriers expand their 5G networks across the country, they are faced with an equally dangerous prospect: that one of 5G’s spectrum bands may interfere with the radio altimeters aboard commercial aircraft below 2,500 feet, potentially causing their automated landing controls to misjudge the distance from the ground and crash.</p><p>Sticking the landing is generally considered one of the more important parts of a flight — which is, in part, why you never hear people applaud during takeoff. As such, the FAA, which regulates American air travel, and the FCC, which controls the use of our telecommunications spectrum, have found themselves at loggerheads over how, when and where 5G might be safely deployed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>5G is shorthand for 5th generation, referring to the latest standard for cellular service. First deployed in 2019, 5G operates on the same basis as its 4G predecessor — accessing the internet and telephone network via radio waves beamed at local cell antennas — but does so at broadband speeds up to 10Gb/s. However, because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_band_(IEEE)">5G can operate on the C band spectrum</a>, there’s a chance that it can interfere with radio altimeters if within close proximity to airports, especially the older models lacking sufficient RF shielding.</p><p>“The fundamental emissions may lead to blocking interference in the radar altimeter receiver,” a 2020 study by <a href="https://www.rtca.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/SC-239-5G-Interference-Assessment-Report_274-20-PMC-2073_accepted_changes.pdf">aeronautics technical group RTCA</a>, observed. “The spurious emissions, on the other hand, fall within the normal receive bandwidth of the radar altimeter, and may produce undesirable effects such as desensitization due to reduced signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), or false altitude determination due to the erroneous detection of the interference signal as a radar return.”</p><p>So when the FCC sold a range of C band in the 3.7 GHz to 3.98 GHz frequency range <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-announces-winning-bidders-c-band-auction">last February for a cool $81 billion</a>, the airline industry under the umbrella of Airlines for America (which represents American Airlines, Delta, FedEx and UPS) <a href="https://www.5gtechnologyworld.com/5g-altimeter-interference-aviation-versus-telecoms/">took umbrage</a>. These concerns prompted the FAA to issue a warning about the issue <a href="https://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgSAIB.nsf/dc7bd4f27e5f107486257221005f069d/27ffcbb45e6157e9862587810044ad19/%24FILE/AIR-21-18.pdf">last November</a> and led Verizon/AT&amp;T to push back their plans to launch 5G service on C Band by a month.</p><p>This warning, in turn, prompted the CTIA (the wireless industry’s main lobbying arm) to <a href="https://www.5gandaviation.com/">file its counterargument</a> shortly thereafter, asserting that <a href="http://v/">aircraft already safely fly into and out of</a> more than 40 countries that have broadly deployed 5G networks, such as Denmark and Japan. “If interference were possible, we would have seen it long before now,” CTIA President, Meredith Attwell Baker, insisted in a November <a href="https://morningconsult.com/opinions/5g-vs-air-safety-the-faas-false-choice/"><em>Morning Consult</em></a> op-ed.</p><p>However, those countries have also taken steps necessary to mitigate much of the potential issues, such as lowering the power of 5G cell towers, moving towers or simply pointing their receivers away from landing approaches.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/807ad1b0-7975-11ec-bdda-a3ecb5b35e47" alt="it&#39;s a graph with lines and circles and a drawing of an antenna." data-uuid="f32c0336-939c-37a6-ad7b-2d128f9e2f97"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAA</div></figure><p>What’s more, a causal relationship between the 5G rollout and misbehaving altimeters has yet to be established.</p><p>&quot;The C-band is closer to the frequencies used by airplane altimeters than previous 5G deployments,&quot; Avi Greengart, lead analyst at Techsponentia, told Tom’s Guide. &quot;In the US, the 5G we’ve been using has either been used before for prior wireless networks, or it is on really high frequencies with no ability to penetrate a piece of paper, let alone an airplane.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There is a 200MHz buffer zone between C-band and altimeter frequencies, and the part of C-band that is opening up this week is even farther from that point,” he continued. “Additionally, similar frequencies are already in use in Europe with no problems observed. If the airplane’s altimeter filters are working properly, there should be no interference whatsoever.&quot;</p><p>Despite the CTIA’s efforts, the FAA (along with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg) in late December <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2021-12/12.31.2021%20-%20DOT%20and%20FAA%20Letter%20to%20ATT%20and%20Verizon%20.pdf">requested Verizon and AT&amp;T delay their primary rollout by two weeks</a>, starting on January 5th and extending to January 17th, to give the government time to <a href="https://www.faa.gov/5g">further investigate the issue</a>. Unsurprisingly, those complex issues were not resolved within the given time frame, causing the airline industry to look towards the supposedly falling heavens and Chicken Little even harder.</p><p>In a letter obtained by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-major-us-airline-ceos-urge-action-avoid-catastrophic-5g-flight-2022-01-17/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Airlines for America argued the skies would be beset by utter “chaos” amid “catastrophic” failures if 5G were deployed, potentially stranding thousands of passengers overseas. &quot;Unless our major hubs are cleared to fly, the vast majority of the traveling and shipping public will essentially be grounded. This means that on a day like yesterday, more than 1,100 flights and 100,000 passengers would be subjected to cancellations, diversions or delays.&quot;</p><div id="30469a80dfcf4936af5a0ebb5b39ed8f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Full airline CEO letter <a href="https://t.co/NeXVJbFhzQ">https://t.co/NeXVJbFhzQ</a><a href="https://t.co/ws5Y5HKx1X">pic.twitter.com/ws5Y5HKx1X</a></p>— davidshepardson (@davidshepardson) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidshepardson/status/1483148794690740224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>&quot;We are writing with urgency to request that 5G be implemented everywhere in the country except within the approximate two miles of airport runways as defined by the FAA on January 19, 2022,&quot; the airline CEOs leaders argued. &quot;To be blunt, the nation&#39;s commerce will grind to a halt.&quot; The airlines also objected to potential incurred costs related to better shielding their avionics (which helped alleviate the previous issues with hearing aids).</p><p>For its part, United Airlines told <em>Reuters</em> that it faces &quot;significant restrictions on 787s, 777s, 737s and regional aircraft in major cities like Houston, Newark, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago.&quot; That’s about 4 percent of the carrier’s daily traffic. These restrictions would apply to cargo aircraft as well as passenger planes, which will likely further exacerbate the nation’s current supply chain woes.</p><p>The FAA has conceded that 5G cellular technology could potentially cause issues but stopped short of the airline industry’s apocalyptic predictions. “Aircraft with untested altimeters or that need retrofitting or replacement will be unable to perform low-visibility landings where 5G is deployed,” the agency said in a statement, directing airlines that operate Boeing 787s, for example, to take extra precautions when landing on wet or snowy runways as 5G interference could prevent the massive airfcraft’s thrust reversers to fail, leaving it to stop using brake power alone.</p><p>AT&amp;T is none too happy with the FAA’s course of action either. &quot;We are frustrated by the FAA&#39;s inability to do what nearly 40 countries have done, which is to safely deploy 5G technology without disrupting aviation services, and we urge it to do so in a timely manner,&quot; an AT&amp;T spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>The FAA is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-5g-buffer-zones-airports-133305569.html">already considering the airlines’ request for buffer zones</a> and, on January 8th, <a href="https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/2022-01/50%20Airports%20with%205G%20Buffer.pdf">released a list of 50 airports</a> across the country where it plans to implement them. The agency also notes that it has cleared five models of radio altimeter to operate within low-visibility areas where 5G systems operate. These models are installed in more than 60 percent of aircraft flying in the US including the Boeing 737 - 777, Airbus’ A310 - A380, and the MD-10/-11.</p><p>&quot;We recognize the economic importance of expanding 5G, and we appreciate the wireless companies working with us to protect the flying public and the country’s supply chain. The complex U.S. airspace leads the world in safety because of our high standards for aviation, and we will maintain this commitment as wireless companies deploy 5G,&quot; Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, said in a statement on Tuesday.</p><p>This leaves the FAA in a tight spot. With the two week delay having already expired, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-c-band-5g-rollout-182958225.html">Verizon is moving ahead with its 1,700-city, 100 million-customer rollout</a>. AT&amp;T is doing so as well, though on a more limited basis in select parts of eight metro areas including Detroit, Chicago, Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston. The agency has pledged to continue to investigate the issue and regulate based on its findings though it has not yet disclosed what steps it plans to take next for doing so.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/5-g-rollout-faa-airlines-carriers-c-band-143026349.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a28be2f-1e48-4ff9-abbd-9fcd5c27fafb</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:30:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642697273</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T16:48:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Airline Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/43a4c400-7932-11ec-9fce-20910f055bf4" width="4000" height="2557" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/43a4c400-7932-11ec-9fce-20910f055bf4" width="4000" height="2557" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[5G words and an airplane toy are placed on a printed U.S. flag in this illustration taken January 18, 2022.

This could also help Meta prevent third-party platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opensea-nft-insider-trader-resigns-190502174.html">OpenSea&#39;s</a> market from gaining too strong a hold if NFTs prove to be more than a short-lived trend.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-nft-creation-sales-141156280.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eeb36dfd-ddaf-40d9-abfd-11fbe579fea6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:11:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642687918</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T14:12:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/18fe8380-3e0e-11ec-a7fd-4876e8bc97fb" width="3908" height="2545" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/18fe8380-3e0e-11ec-a7fd-4876e8bc97fb" width="3908" height="2545" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A 3D printed Facebook's new rebrand logo Meta and Facebook logo are placed on laptop keyboard in this illustration taken on November 2, 2021.

The Android 11-powered Sikur One, which was developed with the help of Brazilian manufacturer Multilaser, follows the Zero Trust approach to security.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/zero-trust-security/">Zero Trust concept</a> is, in a nutshell, self explanatory. It assumes that no one can fully be trusted from a security perspective. A company or organization typically has control over a Zero Trust setup, which requires users to be authorized, authenticated and continuously validated for them to retain access to apps and data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Sikur One is designed primarily for corporate and government use, with organizations having the ability to control each device in line with their policies. Sikur says the device is compliant with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gdpr/">European GDPR</a> and Brazilian LGPD data privacy standards.</p><p>Using a system called <a href="https://www.sikur.com/solutions/passwordless-authentication/">Sikur ID</a>, the Sikur One can carry out a password-less authentication token function. The company says that will prevent malware and phishing attacks. The phone can be locked or wiped remotely if it&#39;s lost or stolen. Users can restore data from the cloud on another device.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4ef84aa0-78a3-11ec-a9ad-3f8ffc0cde82" alt="Sikur One" data-uuid="df48445f-4132-376f-926d-215cae2b6500"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sikur</div></figure><p>Data is encrypted at the source Users won&#39;t be able to install apps from unsecured third-party stores and Sikur One will switch off location services by default. The company will strip out unneeded system applications, while the Sikur One will be up to date with over-the-air patches. The company says that won&#39;t leave &quot;any room for commonly exploited vulnerabilities.&quot; There&#39;s no USB file transfer support either.</p><p>The Sikur One uses Sikur Messenger as the standard communication platform, encompassing messaging, file storage, file sharing and voice and video calls. All data is stored in a private cloud.</p><p>Despite the security measures, Sikur CEO Fabio Fischer says the smartphone has &quot;the same usability as a regular device.&quot; The Sikur One has access to all apps on the Google Play Store, but the organization in charge of the device can determine what kinds of apps can be downloaded or whether users can install their own apps at all.&nbsp;</p><p>On the hardware side, the Sikur One has a 6.5-inch screen, an octo-core processor, 4GB of memory and 128GB of onboard storage (which is expandable by up to 512GB using a memory card). It has a 4,000 mAh battery and dual SIM support, as well as 4G, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity. The device has a triple camera array on the rear and a 3MP front-facing lens. In addition, there&#39;s a fingerprint sensor and support for facial recognition.</p><p>Sikur One builds on the company&#39;s previous handsets, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-12-archos-sikur-granitephone.html">GranitePhone</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-27-sikurphone-encrypted-data-cryptocurrency-pre-order.html">SikurPhone</a>, which it released in 2015 and 2018, respectively. Although those were also intended for organizations, consumers were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-07-sikur-granitephone-secure-encrypted-smartphone.html">still buying the GranitePhone</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Sikur will offer its latest model to the public as well via its sales channel partners. Pricing varies by country, but the Sikur One costs around $274. That covers the cost of the device as well as a one-year license for Sikur Messenger and mobile device management. After the first 12 months, organization will need to pay $145 per user per year for those features.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sikur-one-android-11-smartphone-zero-trust-multilaser-140031318.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">798b3829-d2b2-497d-ba73-0a65944b2ee1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 14:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642628005</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T21:33:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1bdf8ac0-78a3-11ec-b7f9-f36723560b46" width="999" height="699" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1bdf8ac0-78a3-11ec-b7f9-f36723560b46" width="999" height="699" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sikur]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A hand balancing the Sikur One smartphone on one corner.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sikur One]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon one-day sale knocks up to 40 percent off Anker chargers and accessories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can grab a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:bunch of Anker accessories" href="https://amzn.to/357pPJP">bunch of Anker accessories</a> from Amazon for up to 40 percent off just for today only.
