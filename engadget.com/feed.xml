Influencers and other advertisers with more than 100,000 followers in the country must notify the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) at least 10 days before plugging crypto assets. They&#39;ll face fines of up to ‚Ç¨300,000 (around $342,000) for breaching the rules, which come into force on February 17th.</p><p>Influencers need to disclose if they receive payment for talking up cryptocurrencies. If that&#39;s the case, they&#39;ll need to provide clear and impartial warnings about the risks of crypto, including the fact that investments aren&#39;t regulated. The rules also cover companies that promote crypto assets, as well as PR companies they hire.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>‚ÄúIf influencers weren‚Äôt covered there would be a backdoor to avoid regulation,&quot; CNMV chief Rodrigo Buenaventura told the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a119dc9e-189d-4a87-ae02-a81a37260196"><em>Financial Times</em></a>. &quot;This is new terrain, for us and for them, and there will be moments of friction but that always happens when you bring in rules for something that wasn‚Äôt regulated before.‚Äù</p><p>It&#39;s believed to be the first time a European Union country has brought in such directives. EU members have yet to agree on how to regulate crypto across the bloc. In the meantime, Buenaventura notes, member states are tackling some crypto-related matters, including how they&#39;re advertised.</p><p>Some influencers who have plugged crypto assets and related products have found themselves in hot water. In July, French authorities fined a reality TV star ‚Ç¨20,000 ($22,800) for ‚Äúmisleading commercial practices‚Äù over a Bitcoin trading site ad on Snapchat. Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather were this month <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kim-kardashian-floyd-mayweather-sued-alleged-crypto-scam-092422470.html">named as defendants</a> in a class-action lawsuit that accuses them of taking part in a &quot;pump and dump&quot; scheme.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spain-influencers-cryptocurrency-promotion-rules-advertising-172028187.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aae314e7-32f2-4f57-9c47-ee13cd7d1cb6</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 03:18:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642452246</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T20:44:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/920a5870-f891-11eb-89eb-471087e7869f" width="4874" height="3109" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/920a5870-f891-11eb-89eb-471087e7869f" width="4874" height="3109" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Representations of the virtual currency Bitcoin and Ethereum stand on a motherboard in this picture illustration taken May 20, 2021.

In October, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-fired-20-employees-harassment-cases-112540361.html">said</a> more than 20 people had departed and at least another 20 had been disciplined.</p><p>The game publisher was supposed to share a summary of that information publicly before the holidays, according to the report.

It‚Äôs also 50 percent quieter than its Intel predecessor thanks to a more efficient thermal design. The 24-inch model also comes with an excellent 4.5K display that covers the entire DCI-P3 color gamut. Another handy upgrade is the included 1080p FaceTime camera.

That said, we think the 8-core GPU model is a better value. In addition to a more capable GPU, it comes with two extra USB-A ports (its more affordable sibling only has USB-C connectivity), Gigabit Ethernet and a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID. Those might seem like small additions, but they add a lot to the useability of the machine.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-24-inch-amazon-sale-172019869.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8159844e-a5ad-4d2a-aa6d-89c98f97dfe5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 17:20:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642438533</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T16:55:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/f4fdb100-b752-11eb-ab79-10956a28523a" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/f4fdb100-b752-11eb-ab79-10956a28523a" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iMac M1 24-inch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iMac M1 24-inch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 models are up to 15 percent off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve been waiting for a decent deal on an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a>, now might be the time to take the leap.

Revolutionaries sought to break the nation free from its past, specifically from the clutches of the Catholic church, and point France towards a more glorious and prosperous future. They did so, in part, by radically transforming their measurements of the passage of time.</p><p>Throughout the 18th century, most French folks were Catholic as that was the only religion allowed to be openly practiced in the country, and had been since the revocation of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Edict-of-Nantes"><ins>Edict of Nantes</ins></a> in 1685. As such, the nation had traditionally adhered to the 12-month Gregorian calendar ‚Äî itself based on even older, sexagesimal (6-unit) divisible systems adapted from the Babylonians and Egyptians ‚Äî while French clocks cycled every 60 minutes and seconds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But if there was little reason to continue using the established chronology system aside from tradition, the revolutionaries figured, why not transmute it into a more rational, scientifically-backed method, just as the revolution itself sought to bring stability and new order to French society as a whole? And what better system to interpose than that of the decimal, which already governed the nation‚Äôs weights and measures. So, while it wasn‚Äôt busy abolishing the privileges of the First and Second Estate, eliminating the church‚Äôs power to levy taxes or just <a href="https://revolution.chnm.org/d/392/"><ins>drowning nonjuring Catholic priests en masse</ins></a>, France‚Äôs neophyte post-revolution government set about reforming the realm‚Äôs calendars and clocks.</p><p>The concept of decimal time, wherein a day is broken down into multiples of 10, was first suggested more than thirty years prior when French mathematician, Jean le Rond d&#39;Alembert, <a href="http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1756.encyclopedie0311.6994586"><ins>argued</ins></a> in 1754, ‚ÄúIt would be very desirable that all divisions, for example of the livre, the sou, the toise, the day, the hour, etc. would be from tens into tens. This division would result in much easier and more convenient calculations and would be very preferable to the arbitrary division of the livre into twenty sous, of the sou into twelve deniers, of the day into twenty-four hours, the hour into sixty minutes, etc.‚Äù</p><p>By the eve of the Revolution, <a href="https://archive.org/details/dcouvertedtalon00collgoog/page/n8/mode/2up"><ins>the idea had evolved into</ins></a> a year split into 12 months of 30 days apiece, their names inspired by crops and the prevailing weather in Paris during their occurrences. That there are 365 days in a year is an immutable fact dictated by the movement of the Earth around our local star. So, 12 months of 30 days apiece resulted in 5 days (6 in a leap year!) left over. These, the revolutionaries reserved for national holidays.</p><p>Each week was divided into 10 days, every day was split into 10 equal hours, those were split into 100 minutes, with each minute divided into 100 seconds (roughly 1.5 times longer than conventional minutes) and each second into 1000 ‚Äútierces.‚Äù Individual tierces could also be divided into 1000 even tinier units, called ‚Äúquatierces.‚Äù The implementation of tierces would also lead to the creation of a new unit of length, called the ‚Äúhalf-handbreadth,‚Äù which is the distance the twilight zone travels along the equator over the course of one tierce, and equal to one billionth of the planet‚Äôs circumference ‚Äî around 4 centimeters.</p><p>Decimal time was formally adopted by <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Time_and_the_French_Revolution/y7fEHa7eHYEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1"><ins>National Convention decree in 1793</ins></a>, ‚ÄúThe day, from midnight to midnight, is divided into ten parts, each part into ten others, and so forth until the smallest measurable portion of duration.‚Äù As such, midnight would be denoted as 00:00 while noon would be 5:00.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/adaf6f80-7572-11ec-9cf7-0e1ed884f638" style="height:471;width:473;" alt="A clock face with decimal and conventional demarcations" data-uuid="823b6058-abd4-395e-a5de-41d0f53b8430"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Public Domain</div></figure><p>At midnight of the autumn equinox on September 22nd of that year, France‚Äôs Gregorian calendar ushered in 1st Vend√©miaire Year II of the French Republican calendar. From there on, every new year would begin at midnight of the Autumn equinox, as observed by the Paris Observatory.</p><p>‚ÄúThe new calendar was based on two principles,‚Äù a 2017 exhibition at the International Museum of Watches, <a href="https://journal.hautehorlogerie.org/en/decimal-time-the-revolution-that-never-was/"><em><ins>Looking for Noon at Five O‚ÄôClock</ins></em></a>, noted. ‚ÄúThat the Republican year should coincide with the movement of the planets, and that it should measure time more accurately and more symmetrically by applying the decimal system wherever possible. Non-religious, it advocated a rational approach and honored the seasons and work in the fields.‚Äù</p><p>The main advantage of a decimal time system is that, since the base used to divide the time is the same as the one used to represent it, the whole time representation can be handled as a single string.</p><p>On one hand, this system offered the clear advantage that both the numerical base used to define the time and the numerical base used to divide it are the same number. For example, quick, how many seconds are there in three hours? The answer, most people will Google, is 10,800 ‚Äî 60 seconds/minute x 60 minutes/hour x 3 hours. In decimal time, you simply get 30,000 ‚Äî 3 hours x 10,000 seconds/hour.</p><div id="a6716291bab44ccb83415c3fea065f1e"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/KncbFme" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>However, due to an oversight in its otherwise logical design on account of gaps in astronomical knowledge, the Republican calendar struggled to properly accommodate leap years. ‚ÄúThe four-year period, after which the addition of a day is usually necessary, is called the Franciade in memory of the revolution which, after four years of effort, led France to republican government, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Time_and_the_French_Revolution/y7fEHa7eHYEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1"><ins>National Convention decreed</ins></a>. ‚ÄúThe fourth year of the Franciade is called Sextile.‚Äù</p><p>Problem is that leap years, if we‚Äôre counting new years by midnights on the autumnal equinox in Paris, don‚Äôt consistently happen every four years. By equinox measure, the first leap year of the Republican calendar would actually have to occur in year III while the leaps in years XV and XX would happen half a decade apart.</p><p>There were also more practical issues with swapping the nation‚Äôs chronology over to an entirely new system, like the fact that people already had perfectly good clocks which they‚Äôd have to replace, were decimal time to remain in effect. It was also wildly unpopular with the working class who would only receive one day of rest out of 10 using the Republican calendar (plus a half day on the fifth), rather than the existing Gregorian one-day-in-seven, not to mention that the ten-day week played havoc with traditional Sunday religious services, seeing as how Sunday would cease to exist.</p><p>Overall, the idea simply failed to capture public support ‚Äî despite edicts demanding the creation of decimal-based clocks ‚Äî and was officially suspended on April 7th, 1795. The French then took a quick crack at metric time, which similarly measured time‚Äôs passage in factors of ten but based its progression in conventional seconds (aka 1/86400th of a day). Of course all of these efforts were rendered moot when Napoleon declared himself emperor in 1804, made peace with the Vatican and reinstituted the Gregorian calendar, thereby relegating both the Republican calendar and decimal time to the dustbin of history.

However, the UK Home Office is reportedly planning an ad campaign to mobilize public opinion against end-to-end encryption using what critics called &quot;scaremongering&quot; tactics, according to a report from <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/revealed-uk-government-publicity-blitz-to-undermine-privacy-encryption-1285453/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The UK government plans to team up with charities and law enforcement agencies on a public relations blitz created by M&amp;C Saatchi advertising agency, the report states. The aim of the campaign is to relay a message that end-to-end encryption could hamper efforts to curb child exploitation online.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We have engaged M&amp;C Saatchi to bring together the many organizations who share our concerns about the impact end-to-end encryption would have on our ability to keep children safe,&quot; a Home Office spokesperson told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in a statement. The government has allocated ¬£534,000 ($730,500) for the blitz, according to a letter sent from the Home Office in response to a freedom of information request.&nbsp;</p><p>The campaign may include elements designed to make the public &quot;uneasy,&quot; according to a slideshow designed to help it recruit non-profit coalition partners. That includes a proposed stunt with adult and child actors placed in a glass box as it fades to black. It also involves a &quot;social media activation where we ask parents to write to Mark [Zuckerberg] via their Facebook status.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>One slide noted that &quot;most of the public have never heard&quot; of end-to-end encryption, meaning they can &quot;be easily swayed&quot; on the subject. It also states that the government &quot;must not start a privacy vs safety debate.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Privacy advocates called the plans &quot;scaremongering&quot; and said that a lack of end-to-end encryption could have the opposite intended effect. &quot;Without strong encryption, children are more vulnerable online than ever. Encryption protects personal safety and national security‚Ä¶ what the government is proposing puts everyone at risk,&quot; Internet Society&#39;s Robin Wilton told <em>Rolling Stone</em>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-government-is-reportedly-planning-ad-campaign-attacking-end-to-end-encryption-101610703.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d30437b-ffc2-4ed5-a2fa-097ad935942b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 10:16:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642418627</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T11:23:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b565ae80-777d-11ec-bdfb-ffe00afc91bf" width="3311" height="2220" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b565ae80-777d-11ec-bdfb-ffe00afc91bf" width="3311" height="2220" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Hird / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A general view shows the headquarters of Britain's Home Office in central London January 15, 2007.

The STI E-RA Concept hints at Subaru&#39;s upcoming track vehicle with 1,073HP of total power from its four Yamaha motors, extensive downforce and all-wheel drive mated to a &quot;unique&quot; torque vectoring system that maximizes grip and stability.</p><p>While the 60kWh battery is relatively small, Subaru is confident the E-RA can thrive on the track. It&#39;s hoping to set a N√ºrburgring lap time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds at some point in 2023. That&#39;s not as quick as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-03-vw-id-r-breaks-nurburgring-efficiency-record.html">VW&#39;s ID.R</a> (6 minutes 5 seconds), but it&#39;s comfortably ahead of road cars like Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-intrigue-at-the-nurburgring-as-tesla-unofficially-beats-porsche.html">Model S Plaid</a> (7 minutes 35 seconds).

Subaru didn&#39;t discuss under-body changes, but the upgraded Solterra has a roof spoiler, skirt spoilers and other customizations to signal its performance ambitions.</p><p>However much the E-RA represents Subaru&#39;s motorsport plans, it&#39;s also serving as a declaration of intent. Like VW&#39;s racer, it shows the company is serious about EVs and can produce high-performance cars in addition to everyday people haulers. The challenge is to translate lessons learned from concepts like this to regular vehicles. Subaru is late to EVs compared even to incumbents like VW, Mercedes and GM, and it may need to move quickly if it wants to counter the electrification efforts of its rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/subaru-sti-e-ra-concept-electric-race-car-213630682.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5f98962-82ac-4c6c-95ef-1f34416111bb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 21:36:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642368991</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T03:43:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cb17fa40-7709-11ec-a4be-a9544de38301" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cb17fa40-7709-11ec-a4be-a9544de38301" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Subaru]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Subaru STI E-RA Concept electric race car]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Subaru STI E-RA Concept electric race car]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Safari exploit can leak browser histories and Google account info]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple device users appear to be vulnerable to a significant browser privacy flaw. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/16/safari-bug-leak-browsing-history-info/">According</a> to <em>9to5Mac</em>, FingerprintJS has <a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/indexeddb-api-browser-vulnerability-safari-15/">disclosed</a> an exploit that lets attackers obtain your recent browser history, and even some Google account info, from Safari 15 across all supported platforms as well as third-party browsers on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. The IndexedDB framework (used to store data on many browsers) is violating the &quot;same-origin&quot; policy that prevents documents and scripts from one location (such as a domain or protocol) from interacting with content from another, letting appropriately coded websites deduce Google info from signed-in users as well as histories from open tabs and windows.</p><p>The flaw only compromises the names of the databases rather than the content itself. However, this would still be enough for a malicious site owner to grab your Google username, discover your profile picture and otherwise learn more about you. The history could also be used to piece together a rudimentary profile of the sites you like. Private browsing won&#39;t defeat the exploit, FingerprintJS said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked Apple for comment. FingerprintJS said it reported the issue on November 28th, however, and that Apple hadn&#39;t yet addressed it with security patches honoring same-origin policy. Until then, the only solution may be to either use a third-party browser on Macs or block all JavaScript, neither of which is necessarily an option.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/safari-webkit-exploit-browser-history-google-account-200711732.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3d8fe56-eb30-4ef0-a821-19730c7be124</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 20:07:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642363633</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T01:58:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0fe9a3a0-7703-11ec-9ddf-d35fd3b1c7e7" width="2000" height="1311" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0fe9a3a0-7703-11ec-9ddf-d35fd3b1c7e7" width="2000" height="1311" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro with Safari browser]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro with Safari browser]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Walmart may offer a cryptocurrency and NFTs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Walmart apparently doesn&#39;t want to be left out of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ap-nft-marketplace-photojournalism-134011058.html">the crypto rush</a>. <em>CNBC</em> has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/16/walmart-is-quietly-preparing-to-enter-the-metaverse.html">learned</a> Walmart filed several trademark <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=97197301&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">applications</a> with the USPTO in late December for selling virtual goods, and in another filing said it would provide a cryptocurrency as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">NFTs</a>.

As <em>The Guardian</em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/ukraine-says-evidence-points-to-russia-being-behind-cyber-attack">reports</a>, Ukraine&#39;s digital transformation ministry has blamed Russia for the hack, accusing the country of fighting a &quot;hybrid war&quot; meant to &quot;destabilize&quot; an already tense situation and erode trust in the Ukranian government. While officials didn&#39;t elaborate on the evidence linking the attack to Russia, Microsoft shared details late Saturday that suggested a hostile nation was responsible.</p><p>The company&#39;s Threat Intelligence Center noted that the code was purely destructive malware disguised as ransomware. It had a ransom note, a Bitcoin wallet and an encrypted messaging identifier, but no recovery mechanism ‚Äî in fact, it wipes the Master Boot Record (the hard drive element that tells a PC how to load the OS) and downloads malware meant solely to corrupt files. All known targets are in Ukraine, and there aren&#39;t any tangible links between this campaign and other groups.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Russia denied any involvement in the cyberattack.

It wasn&#39;t yet clear if there were other victims in Ukraine or beyond. However, it&#39;s safe to presume the timing of the attack is problematic regardless of the perpetrator. Ukraine and its allies have been worrying for months about signs of a looming Russian invasion, and the US on January 14th claimed Russia was planning a false flag operation that would help it justify that invasion. The cyberattack appears to be exacerbating those tensions, and may have weakened Ukraine&#39;s government infrastructure at a critical moment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ukraine-blames-russia-for-cyberattack-151210108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">915658f9-c30e-45cd-bd2d-b0034156478f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 15:12:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642345931</ingested><modified>2022-01-16T15:12:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/864b49d0-76d7-11ec-a62b-6fba360166d7" width="3840" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/864b49d0-76d7-11ec-a62b-6fba360166d7" width="3840" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2022/01/14: In this photo illustration, a warning message in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish languages is displayed on a smartphone screen.

New York resident Alejandro Vivar <a href="https://www.law360.com/newyork/articles/1455512/apple-sued-for-fraud-over-headphone-charging-capacity">has filed</a> a potential class action lawsuit over allegations <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-16-beats-powerbeats-pro-review.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> design defects prevents the wireless earbuds from charging properly. As it&#39;s reportedly too easy to lose contact between the buds and their charging case, one of the earpieces either won&#39;t charge &quot;consistently&quot; or quickly drain its charge. Apple committed fraud by misrepresenting battery life and failing to address issues it supposedly knew about, the plaintiff said.</p><p>Vivar&#39;s attorneys suggest a combination of the case design and an insufficiently sturdy ear &quot;gasket&quot; (the piece that goes into your ear) may be responsible. Customers have had to resort to inserting a &quot;wedge&quot; to keep the charging pins in contact, according to the lawsuit. The lawyers also reject Apple&#39;s claims the Powerbeats Pro are sweat- and water-resistant, arguing that sweat corrodes the charging contacts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The lawsuit calls for Apple to &quot;correct&quot; the situation, compensate affected users and pay unspecified damages. If the lawsuit is fully certified as a class action, it would cover both New York customers as well as those in Georgia, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota and Virginia.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Apple for comment.

Researchers at Northwestern University (including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engage-game-boy-211023869.html">battery-free Game Boy</a> creator Josiah Hester) have <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2022/01/fitbit-for-the-face-can-turn-any-face-mask-into-smart-monitoring-device/">developed</a> a &quot;FaceBit&quot; face mask sensor that can track a wide range of health data from inside an N95 mask. The magnetically-attached unit can gauge your heart rate using the subtle head movements from blood pumping, and can detect leaks or a poor fit by looking for sudden dips in mask resistance.</p><p>Those measurements, in turn, can help the sensor detect a slew of other conditions. Heart and breathing data could let you know when you&#39;re stressed and need a break. And while the sensor won&#39;t replace an N95 fit test (to verify a proper seal), it&#39;s capable enough to help you maintain that fit over the course of a long day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You might not have to charge the sensor, either. While there is a battery in the prototype, the sensor uses breathing force, heat, motion and the Sun to extend the mask&#39;s longevity to 11 days. Hester eventually wants the mask to be battery-free.</p><p>FaceBit will need to go through clinical trials and other tests before it&#39;s ready for real-world use. However, Hester&#39;s team has already <a href="https://facebit.health/">released the project</a> code and hardware to the public to help others build and verify it.  While you probably won&#39;t buy one of these for personal use, it could be crucial for hospitals eager to keep workers safe and prevent burnout over long shifts.</p><div id="24e5ecf3cc234d6b8c743235c72cf70e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zENpI85PDA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebit-smart-face-mask-sensor-205238551.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5048bf1-a45e-4dbb-98c4-bee1b2ae6cd2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 20:52:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642280237</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T01:58:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/16b07800-7639-11ec-b59d-12297d33e9d3" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/16b07800-7639-11ec-b59d-12297d33e9d3" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Northwestern University]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['FaceBit' smart face mask sensor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['FaceBit' smart face mask sensor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mac and Linux games leave Humble Bundle‚Äôs Trove after January 31st]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re on Humble Bundle and use a Mac or a Linux computer, you may want to download all the games you can from the service&#39;s Trove before the month ends.

The Humble Trove is a catalog of over 70 DRM-free games that you can access, so long as you have a Choice subscription. A few days ago, Humble <a href="https://www.engadget.com/humble-choice-subscription-change-214917516.html">announced</a> that it&#39;s simplifying its subscription service by offering a single $12 monthly plan that gives you permanent copies of all the games for that month.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to getting access to Trove, you&#39;ll also also be able to play the Humble Games Collection with a more modern collection of titles starting in February if you subscribe. To be able to access the games in the Humble Trove and Collection, though, you will have to download the service&#39;s new app. That new app is Windows only, leaving you out completely in case you&#39;re a Mac or Linux user. Humble has already started <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/humblebundles/comments/s2iqka/if_youre_not_on_windows_bye_bye_trove/">sending users an email</a>, reminding them that they only have until January 31st to download games if they&#39;re not on Windows.

The proposed hardware would disrupt the tracking on heat-seeking missiles by steering infrared laser energy toward the oncoming projectiles.</p><p>The courier service pointed to &quot;several&quot; foreign incidents where attackers used portable air defense systems against civilian aircraft. While there weren&#39;t specific examples, <em>NBC</em> pointed to Iran shooting down a Ukranian airliner in January 2020 (reportedly due to mistaking the jet for a cruise missile) and a Malaysian flight brought down by Russia-backed Ukranian separatists in July 2014.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>FedEx first applied for the laser system in October 2019.
