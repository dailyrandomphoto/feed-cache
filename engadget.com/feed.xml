From security cameras to smart light bulbs, pretty much any internet-connected device that you can control via an app is enough to get you started on your smart home journey. But before you dive in, we advise taking a few preliminary steps. For one, don’t try to outfit your entire smart home in one go. Not only can this be quite expensive, we think it’s generally best to buy just one or two items first to see if you like them. From there, you can figure out if you want to buy more devices, making sure that they’re compatible with one another. Below are our suggestions for the best of each smart device category, with alternate suggestions where appropriate.</p><h2>Before you start, pick a voice assistant</h2><p>While plenty of smart home devices are platform agnostic, there are some — smart speakers and smart displays in particular — that require you to choose your voice assistant. Currently, that means deciding if you’ll use the Google Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa on a regular basis. (I’ll address Siri in a moment.) They’re both compatible with various smart home products from light bulbs to robot vacuums, but there are certain devices that work best with either Google or Amazon. Nest products, for example, are more compatible with Google-powered speakers and displays. They can still work with Amazon devices, but certain features might be disabled. The same holds true with Amazon products: They work better if they’re in the same ecosystem.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So how do you choose between Alexa and Google Assistant? It really depends on your personal preferences. Do you listen to Audible, watch Prime Video and tend to do a lot of shopping on Amazon? Then you might lean toward an Alexa-powered product. Do you use a lot of Google services like YouTube and Google Podcasts? A Google-powered device might be best.</p><p>If you want a voice assistant that’s great at answering questions, Google Assistant tends to be better than Alexa. Amazon’s helper, on the other hand, currently supports more smart home products. The company’s smart speakers and displays also support the Zigbee smart home protocol, and some devices even have built-in smart home hubs. Both Google and Amazon devices can sync with your calendar, though Google’s tend to work better with Google services. Plus, if you already have an Android phone, you might be more comfortable with Google Assistant anyway.</p><p>But what about Siri? Apple’s assistant is an option as well, but it doesn’t have the same level of device support as Google and Amazon. The HomePod mini and the (now discontinued) HomePod are the only Siri-compatible speakers on the market at the moment, too. That said, it’s not too hard to find HomeKit-compatible gear as more third-party companies add support for it, but you currently have a smaller pool of devices to choose from.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h3>Best smart speaker: Sonos One</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/914b9040-7a8c-11ea-9ee7-aa6c14e6afb5" alt="Sonos One smart speaker." data-uuid="77872500-1368-45aa-9f4c-36cc0673f1ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham</div></figure><p>Our recommendation for the best smart speaker is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Sonos One" href="https://fave.co/31LNvla">Sonos One</a>. It’s compact enough to fit in most areas in your home, but more importantly, it delivers excellent audio quality that’s superior to a lot of other smart speakers out there. When tuned properly to the acoustics of your room — which requires the iOS app — the sound is fantastic, with punchy bass and clear highs. Unfortunately, the Android app doesn’t have TruePlay tuning (Sonos has not said whether it’s in the works), but the speakers should still sound admirable. It’s also compatible with a slew of  streaming services, including major ones like Spotify and Pandora.</p><p>The main benefit that a Sonos speaker brings over the competition is that it’s a gateway to a multi-room audio setup that you can build out over time. It’s also convenient if you plan on building a home theater setup later on, as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-18-sonos-one-review.html">One</a> integrates well with Sonos soundbars. On top of that, the Sonos One supports both Alexa and Google Assistant, so you don’t have to worry about picking one voice assistant over the other.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/31LNvla" id="ac81c869b45542adb77c867ca0fda046" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sonos;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Sonos One at Sonos - $219</a><h3>Runner-up: Amazon Echo Studio</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/84def960-de40-11ea-9df7-585cf9572509" alt="Amazon Echo Studio" data-uuid="6d7ee036-22bd-4f67-9ea9-23309a9cdc72"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re not interested in a multi-room audio setup, we also like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon&#x002019;s Echo Studio" href="https://amzn.to/3otXvYe">Amazon’s Echo Studio</a>. The price is comparable to the Sonos One and the audio quality is on par, too. As you can imagine, this is an especially compelling choice if you already know you’d prefer Alexa over Google Assistant.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3otXvYe" id="018e24208e9945aab93d1ef21611dde5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Echo Studio at Amazon - $200</a><h3>Best $100 smart speaker: Amazon Echo</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/305a54e0-2b4b-11eb-bd76-0fc9e489604d" alt="Amazon Echo 2020" data-uuid="3331f9e3-8e89-3715-a411-6bf1969da330"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>For those with tighter budgets, there are a handful of smart speakers around $100. We <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-smart-speakers-guide-google-amazon-echo-sonos.html">recommend</a> picking up one of the three latest smart speakers from either Google, Amazon or Apple. Out of the three, we think the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo" href="https://amzn.to/3FdU1zQ">Echo</a> has the best audio quality. Our colleague Nate Ingraham <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-2020-review-130046336.html">said</a> its bass is impressive and the mid-range frequencies are pretty powerful. You can also pair two together to get even better stereo sound.</p><p>That said, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nest Audio" href="https://fave.co/3n7vHsW">Nest Audio</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HomePod mini" href="https://fave.co/3CcfPcS">HomePod mini</a> are no slouches either. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-review-140030652.html">HomePod mini</a> sounds balanced, while the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-review-143012511.html">Nest Audio</a> has pretty good bass tones. Again, it all comes down to which assistant you prefer.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FdU1zQ" id="1d546d78cee04b39b1f9240e264b075d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Echo at Amazon - $100</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3n7vHsW" id="23a918a3579f442998ce28bc53a7d8ee" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Audio at B&amp;H - $100</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3CcfPcS" id="11fa7e1d68744fecac5994f2ce4597ef" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy HomePod mini at B&amp;H - $100</a><h3>Best Alexa smart display: Echo Show 8</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/718974a0-d591-11eb-adfb-3160cf0ccb0c" alt="Amazon Echo Show 8" data-uuid="dbe3e9b2-eee0-3ca3-a0d4-07164d89344e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The best Alexa-powered smart display is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 8" href="https://amzn.to/3F8skbs">Echo Show 8</a>. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3wEsFj7">Echo Show 5</a> is a little too small, while the Echo Show 10 and its rotating screen take up too much space. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Echo Show 8</a>, on the other hand, is perfectly sized for most rooms in the house. Like other Alexa-powered smart displays, it supports plenty of video streaming services including Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix and it comes with a couple of built-in browsers that you can use to surf the web. Unfortunately, it doesn’t support YouTube, which is a pretty notable omission considering how ubiquitous the service is. As a workaround, you can access it via the aforementioned browsers, but the experience isn’t as smooth as if it were a native app.</p><p>You can use the Show 8 to make video calls with any phone or tablet with the Alexa app. Alternatively, it supports Skype, Zoom and Amazon’s own Chime service. Like the Nest Hub Max, the Show 8 also has an optional face-tracking feature that follows your movements around the room during a call.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3F8skbs" id="503548899051458db79ff330a4e246b8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Echo Show 8 at Amazon - $130</a><h3>Best Google smart display: Nest Hub (2nd gen)</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/61ad4ec2-90aa-11eb-bfbf-573fb1ae35ef" alt="Google Nest Hub 2021 (2nd gen) photo.

It has a 7-inch screen, which makes it just big enough to fit in most rooms in the house. The size also makes it work well as a digital photo frame. You can set it up to pull in pictures of friends and family from your Google Photos library, and there’s a smart algorithm that automatically uses the best shots while avoiding the blurry ones. As you might expect, you can also use the display to watch YouTube, Netflix and other streaming services.</p><p>Plus, a smart display without a camera is great if you want to place it in more intimate places like the bedroom, where you might be more protective of your privacy. If you place it by your bedside, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">Nest Hub</a> also has a sensor that can track your sleep patterns, if you opt in.</p><p>If you prefer a display with a camera, we recommend splurging on the higher-end <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nest Hub Max" href="https://fave.co/3pNUOCW">Nest Hub Max</a>. Its built-in camera can be used for video calls with Google Duo, Google Meet and Zoom. It also has an optional face-tracking feature that lets the camera follow you around during calls. One benefit of the camera is that it gives you the option for Face Match, a feature that automatically recognizes individual members of the house and then displays the information that’s pertinent only to them, like calendar alerts.</p><p>Additionally, the camera adds a unique gestures feature that lets you play and pause media simply by holding up your hand to the screen, which is convenient if you need to stop the music without having to shout across the room. The Nest Hub Max also has better audio quality than the Hub thanks to its larger speakers.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3wHhGp9" id="38b68d24b5ce4340a364331a4bddff54" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub at B&amp;H - $100</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3pNUOCW" id="57bace0447e945a09c3067c4cb5a8d52" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub Max at B&amp;H - $230</a><h3>Best smart lights: Philips Hue</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/5574d7a0-0d69-11eb-a5d9-6907f548d61e" alt="Philips Hue smart light bulbs" data-uuid="02e675c4-0dd2-30fb-bc04-78a9c7e9eb7d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon / Philips</div></figure><p>One of the easiest entry points to the smart home is to swap out some of your existing light bulbs with smart ones. Smart light bulbs let you control your lighting remotely, either via an app and with your voice. They add automation and scheduling to the mix, so you can have them turn on and off at certain times of the day. Some also let you adjust their brightness and color temperature, or even let you create a custom light scene.</p><p>Our favorite smart lighting products come from Philips Hue, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:White and Color Ambiance LED Smart Button Starter Kit" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjRaO6">White and Color Ambiance LED Smart Button Starter Kit</a> is a particularly good entry point as it includes three Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance 60W LED smart bulbs; a Hue hub that lets you control up to 50 lights; and a Smart Button if you want to have the option of turning off the lights without having your phone around.</p><p>This kit offers lots of versatility in lighting styles; you can change not just the brightness but also the color temperature and experiment with all different shades of the rainbow, decking out your room in whatever light scene you desire. If that seems a little too daring, Philips offers alternatives: The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit" href="https://amzn.to/3CeFthg">Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit</a> lacks the color option, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hue White Starter Kit" href="https://amzn.to/3wDkCmw">Hue White Starter Kit</a> won’t let you adjust the color temperature.</p><p>The main reason we prefer Philips Hue bulbs is that they’re widely supported across smart home ecosystems. Not only can you find them pretty much anywhere, but they’ll work with Google, Amazon and Apple’s HomeKit. Since all the bulbs connect to the Hue hub via the Zigbee protocol (and not your home’s WiFi), it tends to be more reliable and it won’t slow down your home internet connection either.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjRaO6" id="9fe2ec724416420ba4f7f91a1ba5627c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Philips Hue starter set at Best Buy - $130</a><h3>Best budget smart lights: Cync by GE</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/49403500-582d-11ec-bef3-22d267ca3d71" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="GE Cync smart light bulbs" data-uuid="fa1de799-ca8a-35b7-9c23-8b292251791c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GE</div></figure><p>If you’re not quite ready to dive into a whole lighting ecosystem or you just prefer a more affordable alternative, we suggest GE’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart LED Bulb" href="https://amzn.to/3C9FSlg">Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart LED Bulb</a>. Formerly known as C by GE, these bulbs don’t require a connecting hub: just screw in the bulb, connect it with the app, and you’re done. It, too, offers an array of lighting options in all manner of colors, and you can set schedules as well. Cync’s Direct Connect system works with both Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa, but you’ll need to get a hub if you want to connect to Apple’s HomeKit.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3C9FSlg" id="a7246528c47d498ca150aa29cba2bfde" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Cync by GE (2 pack) at Amazon - $24</a><h3>Best security camera: Wyze Cam V3</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/84afa940-582d-11ec-ae89-7810615a538c" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Wyze Cam V3" data-uuid="5e45531c-e029-37c2-a2ee-1179c8569172"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Wyze</div></figure><p>Security cameras are helpful for catching intruders, nabbing porch pirates or just keeping an eye on your pet while you’re out of the house. Our favorite is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wyze Cam V3" href="https://amzn.to/3wEvSiF">Wyze Cam V3</a> for its wide range of features along with its affordable price. Plus, thanks to its IP65 waterproof rating it can be used either indoors or outdoors, and it has color night vision that’s capable of recording nighttime video in full color.</p><p>Like previous-gen models, it sends alerts to your phone whenever it detects sound or motion. You can also customize Motion Detection Zones that allow you to adjust just how sensitive you want it to be. It also offers 24/7 continuous video recording that you can store via a 32GB microSD card (not included).</p><p>We especially like that the Wyze doesn’t require a subscription; free cloud storage is included with the purchase, and you’ll always have access to the last 14 days of recording on the app. Be warned, however, that the free account can only hold 12-second clips every five minutes. If you want it to record unlimited motion, consider upgrading to a Cam Plus subscription, which includes additional features like alerting you if it detects a person or a package. Fortunately, it’s inexpensive at $2 a month or $15 a year.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3wEvSiF" id="0c4e455f1d3546ac8428322ecb234593" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Wyze Cam V3 at Amazon - $36</a><h3>Best wireless security camera: Blink cameras</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/2d0766e0-327e-11eb-9fb5-f5f70d69930a" style="height:1280;width:1920;" alt="Blink Outdoor and Indoor cameras" data-uuid="aa2aeee8-9d34-3dd5-8180-35356b8c3035"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>There’s a lot to like about the Wyze Cam V3, but it needs to be plugged in.

They both run on AA batteries, so you can place them anywhere you want, and they’ll run for around two years before you need to replace the batteries. The Blink Outdoor is weather resistant, but otherwise both cameras are the same. They both have night vision, motion detection and two-way audio. You can store clips in the cloud via the Blink Subscription Plan or you can also save events locally to a Sync Module 2 via a USB flash drive (sold separately). Unfortunately, Blink works with Alexa only, which could be a non-starter for some.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3wE8UYS" id="ed24a17cfe3a44c9a13873dcd4f6794d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blink Indoor at Amazon - $70</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3c87ah2" id="2b710ffa1b014510a96e6d3c8deaaa71" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Blink Outdoor at Amazon - $90</a><h3>Best doorbell camera: Arlo Essential Video Doorbell</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/60d237f0-800a-11eb-8f6f-b663ffc7fde9" style="height:1241;width:2000;" alt="Arlo video doorbell" data-uuid="443fe154-d8a4-3f2a-8f30-1639f91f85be"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>If you want a camera specifically for your front door, a doorbell camera makes more sense than a standalone option.

There’s also two-way audio so you can talk to whoever’s at the door.</p><p>A highlight of this doorbell is that it comes with a three-month trial to Arlo’s Smart subscription service, which includes a motion detection feature that can tell the difference between a person, package, vehicle or animal. Senior Editor Devindra Hardawar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">said</a> that he really appreciated the package alerts; it did a good job of telling him whenever UPS dropped off a box.

We recommended it in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a> as it did a great job cleaning hard and carpeted surfaces. (We liked the Shark Ion RV761, too, but the Roomba 694 is a newer model.) Plus, the app is really easy to use for luddites and the tech savvy alike. And just in case you don’t have access to the app — maybe you left your phone in another room, for example — the Roomba 694 has manual controls as well.</p><p>One of the reasons the Roomba 694 cleans so well is that it has a three-stage system that tells it to suck up dirt while also navigating around obstacles. When it encounters an especially filthy area, it focuses in on it, making sure it’s clean before moving on. You can also manually instruct it to clean a specific spot in case you need it. And if you prefer to talk to your robot vacuum, the Roomba 694 works well with both Alexa and Google Assistant.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HgVKpz" id="4a6535ec304448c9aa6601316bb3c014" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba 694 at Amazon - $275</a><h3>Best high-end robot vacuum: iRobot Roomba i7+</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/4d25a5d0-dd70-11ea-b7ff-ddeb3a0d2525" style="height:1028;width:1600;" alt="iRobot Roomba i7+" data-uuid="7819e0d4-2ec1-4e5f-8a74-23637c74a45d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you don’t mind spending more money on an even better robot vacuum, we recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba i7+" href="https://amzn.to/3qxI1oK">Roomba i7+</a>. It cleans both carpet and hard floors well, but it’s quieter and smarter.

But the coolest thing about the i7+ is that after each job, it automatically empties its bin into a clean base that can hold about 30 jobs worth of dirt. In short, the i7+ is worth the splurge if you want a robot vacuum that doesn’t require a lot of attention.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qxI1oK" id="6bd61a452eb74e98b92483f21f9136b0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba i7+ at Amazon - $529</a><h3>Best Smart Plug: Wyze Plug</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5cc30f70-582e-11ec-b35f-0d2584546d53" style="height:1500;width:1500;" alt="Wyze Plug" data-uuid="36ac3a51-4035-3bd9-b6a1-6a02efd32b71"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Wyze</div></figure><p>Smart plugs are the easiest way to add a bit of connectivity to your home without spending a ton of money.

The best one we’ve tried is from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wyze" href="https://amzn.to/3c8klyx">Wyze</a>, thanks largely to its easy-to-use app. We were able to fly through the installation process; pairing was seamless and connecting it to WiFi was simple as well. We especially love that it offers two-factor authentication (the rest of the smart plugs we tried did not have this). You can schedule it to go on and off at different times and days. The Wyze Plug works with Alexa, Google Assistant (though you’ll have to go through the Google Home app to pair it) plus the IFTTT service.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3c8klyx" id="ebc52e6598a94e6c88516034a961a27d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Wyze Plug (2 pack) at Amazon - $20</a><h3>Another smart plug option: TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6abeecc0-582e-11ec-b9a9-305eacd03ad0" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="TP-Link Kasa Smart Plug Mini" data-uuid="ea8b2758-d577-3889-a470-7213b4f832d1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TP-Link</div></figure><p>Another solid option is TP-Link’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3n5diNr">Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini</a>. We didn’t find the app as easy to use — installation was not as seamless as the Wyze — but once you get past that, it’s still just as capable. Just like with the Wyze Plug, you can schedule the plug to turn on and off at certain times and days of the week. On top of that, the Kasa actually offers scheduling around sunrise or sunset times, a feature that the Wyze lacks.

Anyone with an LG set running webOS 5.0 or 6.0 (that is, 2020 or newer) can use the cloud gaming service to play <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed</em> or <em>Madden</em> without requiring a media device or PC as a go-between. You&#39;ll need a compatible gamepad, but that shouldn&#39;t be an issue when the Stadia Controller and common console pads should work either wirelessly or through USB.</p><p>Not surprisingly, LG suggests one of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-g1-series-oled-tvs-ces-2021-133053674.html">OLED TVs</a> for Stadia thanks to the fast pixel response times, low latency and (for Stadia Pro subscribers) 4K HDR visuals. They&#39;re certainly not required, though, and it&#39;s arguably the lag from game streaming that will make the larger difference.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Stadia is available through the LG Content Store in all 22 countries where the service already exists. You probably won&#39;t buy a TV with Stadia in mind, but this significantly widens the number of sets where native support is an option — you might be more inclined to try it if the barrier to entry is that much lower.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-lg-smart-tv-release-date-152718368.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">64752abf-fae3-4f24-b1b0-f52414eb4087</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 15:27:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638976469</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T15:14:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/786150b0-5834-11ec-befe-fc6ff23c8f2b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/786150b0-5834-11ec-befe-fc6ff23c8f2b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Stadia on LG Smart TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Stadia on LG Smart TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Polestar will increase its EV's horsepower with a €1,000 software update]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/polestar/"><ins>Polestar</ins></a> has <a href="https://media.polestar.com/global/en/media/pressreleases/642344"><ins>released</ins></a> an over-the-air update that boosts the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-ev-drive-video-133035906.html"><ins>Polestar 2&#39;s</ins></a> torque and horsepower.

The feature is part of Facebook parent Meta&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html">$1 billion investment</a> in creators that includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creators-challenges-affiliate-commission-193917455.html">bonuses</a> for Instagram influencers and an expansion to the Stars program <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10114137082634871">announced yesterday</a> by CEO Mark Zuckerberg.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest feature of professional mode profiles is the addition of the Reels Play <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/programs/bonuses">bonus program</a> that allows creators to earn up to $35,000 a month based on views of qualifying reels (videos). Previously, that program was only open to users with Pages. It&#39;ll be invitation-only for professional profiles to start with, with more information about how to create reels <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/reels-for-facebook">here</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of Reels, Facebook is planning to add the ability to create longer, 60 second reels, save drafts mid-creation and create compositions from multiple clips. Those features are coming &quot;soon&quot; and it&#39;s planning to expand Reels to more countries next year, too. Professional Mode also lets profiles see the same kind of post and audience analytics data that Page users get, including shares, reactions and comments. You can also see your follower growth over time.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s a caveat that, not surprisingly, involves privacy. Once you turn on professional mode, &quot;anyone can follow you and see your public content in their feed,&quot; Facebook said. However, you&#39;ll still be able to limit specific posts or updates to friends only.</p><p>Facebook is playing catchup to rival platforms with the creator community, particularly TikTok, which recently passed 3 billion downloads and is ahead of Facebook in user engagement. On top of the new profiles, it recently introduced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/facebooks-new-website-lets-fans-buy-stars-without-paying-the-app-stores-commissions/">Stars store website</a> that lets creators earn cash from followers without paying app store commissions.

We called one of the latest, the SN30 Pro+, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-8bitdo-sn30-pro-plus-controller-impressions.html">near-perfect Nintendo Switch controller</a> and now you can get that accessory at its best price yet. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sn30 Pro+" href="https://amzn.to/31wILjS">SN30 Pro+</a> is down to $40 today as a Lightning Deal on Amazon, which means you have roughly six hours from the time of writing this to grab it before the price goes back up to $50. This is the same deal we saw on Black Friday, so if you missed it then, you have another opportunity to get it today.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/31wILjS" id="4b9c6ef95ef44a09a0444cff60c0d9a3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 8Bitdo SN30 Pro+ at Amazon - $40</a><p>The SN30 Pro+ will look familiar to those who loved the SNES. It has a similar design to that console&#39;s controller with a D-pad, circular A, B, X and Y buttons and start and select buttons in the middle. But it also has handles for better ergonomics, along with analog sticks and two more buttons. It&#39;s well-built and lightweight, making it easy to throw into a bag and take with you when you want to play with your Switch on the go. While plenty of people will want to use it with Nintendo&#39;s console, the SN30 Pro+ is also compatible with PC, macOS, Android, Steam and Raspberry Pi.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not only did we find the SN30 Pro+ to be even more comfortable than Nintendo&#39;s own Switch Pro Controller, it also has the added benefit of a removable battery pack. It&#39;ll last about 20 hours on a single charge, but in a pinch, you can take out that pack and replace it with AA batteries instead. That&#39;ll come in handy on long flights, camping trips and other situations in which you can&#39;t charge up for a while. We also appreciate that the <a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate-software.html">8BitDo Ultimate Software</a> lets you personalize the controller a bit further by remapping buttons and creating custom profiles.</p><p>The few gripes we had with the SN30 Pro+ were its somewhat tedious syncing process with the Switch (but thankfully you only have to do that once), its lack of a headphone jack and its lack of support for iOS, Xbox and PlayStation. However, if you&#39;re looking for a stocking stuffer for the gamer in your life, the SN30 Pro+ is hard to beat at this sale price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/8-bitdos-sn-30-pro-plus-controller-drops-to-40-for-today-only-133621646.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c346769f-65d3-4033-bc65-9476f32d180d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 13:36:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638970585</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T13:36:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2Fbeac8c50-deca-11e9-bbf5-6f5eb40d32bc&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=afa5d5a9e07e12a37648a5ccd33b6b96dcadcf6f" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2Fbeac8c50-deca-11e9-bbf5-6f5eb40d32bc&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=afa5d5a9e07e12a37648a5ccd33b6b96dcadcf6f" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[8Bitdo&#39;s SN30 Pro+ controller drops to $40 for today only]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple was reportedly forced to halt iPhone and iPad assembly for the first time in a decade]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple was forced to cease <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone</a> and iPad production for several days when it was supposed to kick into high gear, according to a report from <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/Apple-s-nightmare-before-Christmas-Supply-chain-crisis-delays-gift-deliveries"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a>. It&#39;s no secret that Apple hasn&#39;t been immune to the global supply chain shortages despite its enormous purchasing power. The tech giant previously lowered its iPhone 13 production goals for the year and had to cut back on the iPad&#39;s production to allocate more parts for its mobile flagship devices. But this is reportedly the first time in a decade that the company had to cease operations at its factories during China&#39;s Golden Week.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple factories typically ramp up production during the Chinese holidays that take place at the beginning of October, running 24 hour shifts so that it can keep up with holiday shopping demands. This year, though, it reportedly gave its workers some time off instead. A supply chain manager told the publication that it made no sense to pay workers overtime for working during the holidays when there were very limited component and chips to work with. As a result, people who may be thinking of getting a new iPad or a new iPhone as a Christmas gift for loved ones or themselves may not get it in time for the season.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Nikkei Asia</em> says that supply chain issues started way before the pandemic, when Chinese companies blacklisted by the United States hoarded inventories to survive crackdowns. That said, the COVID-19 lockdowns implemented in Malaysia and Vietnam due to the Delta variant heavily affected the production of numerous electrical components and chips.&nbsp;</p><p>In many cases, bottlenecks weren&#39;t caused by the lack of a device&#39;s most expensive components, but its cheaper peripheral parts. Component manufacturers that don&#39;t have as much purchasing power as tech giants fall to the back of the list when it comes to raw materials, after all. For the iPhone 13 Max, for instance, tiny peripherals that only cost a few cents each are what&#39;s causing the delay.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple chief Tim Cook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/apple-aapl-q4-2021-earnings.html">previously said</a> that the company lost $6 billion for the quarter ending in September due to supply chain constraints, and that he believes that it could lose more in the final quarter of the year. It still remains to be seen if Apple would still enjoy the same level of demand by the time it has the components to manufacture its devices. <em>Nikkei Asia</em> says Apple told suppliers that demand persists for the iPhone 13 and to reaccelerate their component production for November, December and January. According to a previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-warned-suppliers-slowing-demand-iphones-070948347.html"><em>Bloomberg report</em></a>, though, Apple warned suppliers that demand for its biggest revenue source has already weakened just before the holidays.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-forced-to-halt-iphone-ipad-assembly-131714897.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e8fd40c-67ed-4bef-9f0d-b1f6dbb935ac</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 13:17:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638969623</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T13:20:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9f506060-5822-11ec-bf5b-acf849375663" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9f506060-5822-11ec-bf5b-acf849375663" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The Hubble telescope wakes up from 'hibernation']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#39;s Hubble telescope has been in a month-long nap since going into system failure in late October. However, early yesterday, the agency announced it is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-hubble-telescope-is-operational-again-155710162.html">waking Hubble up</a>. NASA says the telescope is now functioning as normal, with all four active instruments collecting data.</p><p>On October 23rd, NASA first noticed Hubble&#39;s instruments weren&#39;t receiving messages from the telescope&#39;s control unit. NASA ended up putting the telescope into a sort of safe mode while it tried to figure out what happened. That safe mode takes a long time to come out of because of the sensitivity of Hubble&#39;s hardware. Rapid power or temperature changes aren&#39;t good for its lifespan. The telescope is now 31 years old — Hubble may be nearing the end of its useful life in space. NASA will use the telescope till the end, though, planning to use it in tandem with the Webb telescope, which is expected to finally launch on December 22nd.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-premium-memberships-announcement-160019679.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Discord gives server owners the tools to put channels behind a paywall</a></h2><h3>The company is testing Premium Memberships with a small group of users.</h3><h3></h3><p>Discord has started testing a feature called Premium Memberships.

According to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/12/nintendos-switch-oled-dock-can-now-be-purchased-separately"><em>Nintendo Life</em></a>, the gaming giant revealed the dock would be sold as a standalone item when the OLED Switch was launched. And it has been available in European stores since the beginning of December, but now you can also get one in the US and Canada.

You&#39;d have to have or buy your own LAN/ethernet cable, though, since the dock doesn&#39;t come with one. It also doesn&#39;t include an AC Adapter and an HDMI cable, but it can receive software updates.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can snap up a dock from Nintendo&#39;s store in the US or in Canada for $70.

Marvel movies were as popular as ever, with <em>Eternals</em> holding the top spot for trending films, followed by <em>Black Widow</em>. <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em> are also in the list, along with other hits for the year, such as <em>Dune</em> and <em>Red Notice</em>.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Squid Game</em> captured the attention of people everywhere, and it&#39;s joined by <em>Bridgerton</em>, <em>WandaVision</em>, <em>Cobra Kai</em> and <em>Loki</em> in the top trending TV shows list.

Verizon (Engadget<em>&#39;s</em> former parent company) collected users&#39; location, web browsing and mobile application usage data to send them marketing messages or offers under Selects, though subscribers could opt out if they wanted to. As <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/12/verizon-ignored-users-previous-opt-outs-in-latest-push-to-scan-web-browsing/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> notes, the carrier recently replaced its Selects program with the Verizon Custom Experience Plus and Custom Experience programs.

The carrier also wrote that it keeps browsing information for no more than 6 months. It keeps location and phone number information for approximately one year.&nbsp;</p><p>To remove themselves from the program, users will have to opt out again. While we&#39;re sure a lot of subscribers wouldn&#39;t appreciate being enrolled into marketing programs they previously chose not to participate in, it&#39;s at least easy to unsubscribe.

The organization recently conducted an investigation where it created a series of fake accounts to test the safeguards Instagram has in place to protect young people from potentially deadly pharmaceuticals.</p><p>While hashtags like #mdma are banned on the platform, TTP found it was easy to skirt those restrictions with an account tied to a minor. Using MDMA as an example, the organization found it could employ terms like “mdmamolly” to find people who were selling the substance. In fact, the app’s search algorithm made it easy to find those hashtags, with its autocomplete feature pointing researchers in the right direction.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make matters worse, once someone follows even just one account belonging to an alleged drug dealer, Instagram’s recommendation algorithm will suggest the user follow similar profiles. Despite Instagram&#39;s <a href="https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119"><ins>Community Guidelines</ins></a> prohibiting “buying or selling non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs,” TTP found many drug dealers operate openly on the platform.</p><p>Separately, TTP says Instagram did not take decisive action against the content it found on the platform. The organization claims it submitted 50 posts to the company for review. Of those, Instagram said 36 (or 72 percent) did not violate its Community Guidelines, despite what TTP says were “clear signs” of drug dealing activity. At the time of publishing, the company had only banned one account flagged by TTP. However, when the organization went to check on that profile, it was still up on Instagram along with all of its violating content.</p><p>“We prohibit drug sales on Instagram. We removed 1.8 million pieces of content related to drug sales in the last quarter alone, and due to our improving detection technology, the prevalence of such content is about 0.05 percent of content viewed, or about 5 views per every 10,000,” Stephanie Otway, a spokesperson for Meta, told Engadget. “We’ll continue to improve in this area in our ongoing efforts to keep Instagram safe, particularly for our youngest community members.”</p><p>The report comes just one day before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-adam-mosseri-congress-testify-184609082.html"><ins>Adam Mosseri</ins></a> is slated to testify to the Senate about Instagram’s impact on young users. The platform has faced increasing scrutiny in recent weeks following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html"><ins>testimony from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen</ins></a>. According to Haugen, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html"><ins>Meta, then Facebook</ins></a>, knew from its own internal research Instagram was harmful to many teens and yet the company disregarded those warnings. TTP’s findings are likely to inform some of the questions the consumer protection subcommittee asks Mosseri on Wednesday.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-tech-transparency-project-report-211735946.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">09d23590-6192-419a-a0e5-a5b595eb1e6f</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 21:17:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638911859</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T21:17:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/30e23da0-e979-11eb-bbaf-60938b4d69ff" width="4109" height="2560" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/30e23da0-e979-11eb-bbaf-60938b4d69ff" width="4109" height="2560" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

The company estimates the malware has infected approximately one million Windows PCs globally, which would make it one of the largest known botnets to date.</p><p>A botnet is a network of computers or internet-connected devices all infected by malware that is under the control of a single party. In this case, Google traced Glupteba to at least two individuals based out of Russia. The company is suing them in hopes it will “set a precedent, create legal and liability risks for the botnet operators, and help deter future activity.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At times, the company says it saw the network grow by about 1,000 devices per day. The malware that adds a computer to the Glupteba botnet is usually found hidden on sketchy websites that offer free software. According to Google, Glupteba’s operators used the malware to steal personal data, mine cryptocurrencies and funnel other internet traffic through the infected machines.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/07/google-glupteba-botnet-hack/?utm_campaign=wp_main&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, the hackers also used some of Google’s own services to distribute the malware. The company suspended more than 1,000 accounts that had been used to spread Glupteba.</p><p>“We don’t just plug security holes, we work to eliminate entire classes of threats for consumers and businesses whose work depends on the Internet,” the company said. “We have teams of analysts and security experts who are dedicated to identifying and stopping issues like DDoS, phishing campaigns, zero-day vulnerabilities, and hacking against Google, our products, and our users.”</p><p>Google coordinated with internet infrastructure providers to disrupt the botnet, but warns it has so far only succeeded in stopping it temporarily. Glupteba uses blockchain technology as a failsafe against a complete shutdown. When it doesn’t hear from its owners, the software is programmed to automatically use data encoded on the Bitcoin blockchain for instructions on how to reconnect.</p><p>“Unfortunately, Glupteba’s use of blockchain technology as a resiliency mechanism is notable here and is becoming a more common practice among cyber crime organizations,” Google said. “The decentralized nature of blockchain allows the botnet to recover more quickly from disruptions, making them that much harder to shutdown.” The company says it’s working with its partners to make the internet more resilient to such attacks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-disrupts-glupteba-botnet-202342050.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">257af264-77f4-4590-bb71-2ff6a9aadd9d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 20:23:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638908628</ingested><modified>2021-12-07T20:24:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Internet & Networking Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/0e7b3510-16a2-11ea-bbfe-5fc9911d4886" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/0e7b3510-16a2-11ea-bbfe-5fc9911d4886" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JHVEPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mountain View, California, USA - March 28, 2018: Google sign at Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley.
