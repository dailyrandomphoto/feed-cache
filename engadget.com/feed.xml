The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh6-development-announcement-140038779.html">$2,500 GH6</a>, due to arrive later this year, has major upgrades like 4K 120p and even 5.7K video. The other is the model I’m reviewing today, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-10-bit-60p-video-140057920.html">$1,700 GH5 II</a>.</p><p>As the name suggests, the GH5 II is more of a refresh, with the same 20-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor. However, it has an all-new processor that delivers significant improvements in speed, video quality and AI smarts. Best of all, it’s $300 less than the GH5 was at launch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The big question is whether it’s worth getting this model, waiting for the GH6, or even purchasing an older GH5 that’s now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Mirrorless-Megapixel-DC-GH5-Accessories/dp/B079TC31FC/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=panasonic+gh5&amp;qid=1633010814&amp;sr=8-4">steeply discounted</a>. To find out, I tested the GH5 II’s new features, video quality, autofocus and more — here’s what I found out.</p><h3>Body and handling</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0b3f2bd0-3730-11ec-9ffe-034a1b3053bd" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="35f45301-980c-3cb3-949d-ddd1cf4783b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re already familiar with the GH5, you’ll be very comfortable with the GH5 II — the bodies are nearly identical. That’s a good thing, because it still out-handles many newer cameras, thanks to the excellent grip and logical control positions.</p><p>There are a few key changes, though. While the rear display is a little smaller at 3 inches instead of 3.2 inches, it has slightly more resolution and is significantly brighter. That fixes one of the biggest issues with the GH5: its relatively dim display.</p><p>The electronic viewfinder (EVF) carries the same 3.68 million dot resolution and .76x magnification, but has double the refresh rate at 120Hz. That makes a noticeable difference in image quality; more so than a resolution bump in my opinion. However, it also drains the battery a touch faster.</p><p>Another nice improvement is the addition of USB-C PD compatibility that can charge the battery more quickly. And it comes with a more powerful DMW-BLK22 battery, the same one found in the company’s full-frame S5 camera. While it’s still CIPA-rated for 410 shots like the GH5, it delivers a few more minutes of video recording.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/316938a0-3730-11ec-8fbe-ec6d9268d555" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="17cd8e31-431c-397a-ba01-d4f14b7ced74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The GH5 II has better menus than the GH5, gaining those introduced on the GH5s. It’s a color coded, tabbed menu system with hints to find the option you’re looking for. It also has the info panel from Panasonic’s pro Varicam models (also available on the GH5s), that show important settings at a glance. Another feature for pro shooters is dual zebra controls that let you check two levels at once, like highlights and skin tones.</p><p>As with the GH5, the new model has dual UHS II card slots, but they now support the maximum V90 (300 MB/s) speeds. That’ll ensure stable capture if you’re using the new All-I 4K video settings at up to 400 Mbps, or let the buffer clear faster if you’re snapping photos.</p><h3>Video performance</h3><p>There are several subtle, but important changes to the video capabilities of the GH5. A key one is an update to the image stabilization system. It now delivers up to 6.5 EV of shake protection, up by 1.5 EV over the GH5. When working with compatible lenses and using the IS boost mode, it’s designed to provide more steady shots, even if you’re walking or moving.</p><p>No in-camera stabilization system is ever going to beat a gimbal. However, the GH5 II does a better job than most mirrorless cameras I’ve tried at smoothing out walking or running, provided you’re reasonably careful. More importantly, it makes handheld camera pans and other motion smoother than the GH5 does. If you need some extra stabilization, there’s an electronic mode that does help, though it crops in slightly.</p><p>Another key change is with the autofocus system. In general, continuous autofocus for video is faster and smoother than before, though you’ll still see a tiny bit of hunting or wobble that’s unavoidable with a contrast-detect-only AF system. As before, the system works better at higher frame rates when it has more information to work with.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/82b52430-3730-11ec-9fae-b3e7740ba060" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="cd30be5e-f983-3673-ac26-862eee30c01f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The GH5 II also brings some AI autofocus smarts that couldn’t be added via firmware to the GH5 because of its relatively old processor. It offers double the face and eye-tracking speeds, and can pick up focus when a face is tilted away from the camera. It can recognize heads and human bodies, making tracking more feasible if a person is turning or moving towards or away from the camera. It adds new animal tracking features that can handle most pets and some types of wildlife, as well.</p><p>With these features enabled, it’s easier to keep someone in focus if they or you are moving. Again, this works best at higher frame-rates, but overall, the improved focus hit rates make the camera more practical for vlogging or run-and-gun work, especially for solo operators. Animal tracking is also pretty useful, particularly if pets and/or kids are running around.</p><p>Is the GH5’s subject tracking as good as on Canon or especially Sony’s latest mirrorless cameras? No, because both of those brands use phase-detect systems that can nail focus directly without any wobble. Sony’s latest models, particularly the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">A1</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7s-iii-mirrorless-camera-review-140041536.html">A7S III</a>, also have uncannily fast tracking capabilities that Panasonic has yet to match. Still, the new model is a big step up from the GH5 and certainly good enough for many types of projects.</p><h3>Video quality</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ad4d3980-3730-11ec-aefb-a18108dccf82" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="883625b7-0d4f-3a48-adca-7b8907b1e6a5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Video made the GH5 popular, as it was far ahead of the competition for the price when it first arrived. Five years on, it’s getting pretty old, though, so a new processor helped Panasonic boost the GH5 II’s specs in line with what it’s done on full-frame models like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-s5-full-frame-mirrorless-review-140006301.html">S5</a>.</p><p>To that end, the new model now offers 10-bit 4:2:0 4K and C4K (4,096 x 2,160) video at up to 60 fps, rather than just 8-bit video at 60p as before. That makes it better for slow-mo or high frame-rate video if you want to use log or HDR video settings. Like the GH5, it can also handle 6K 30p anamorphic (4,992 x 3,774) with 10-bit, 4:2:0 color settings. And where All-I capture was limited to 24/25 fps on the GH5, the GH II can now do it at up to 30 fps.</p><p>Though the GH5 II comes with VLog-L shooting out of the box, it&#39;s limited to 12 stops of dynamic range rather than 13 like Panasonic’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-mirrorless-camera-lumix-bgh1-163525921.html">BGH1 box camera</a> and other recent models. Panasonic also introduced two new video modes, Cinelike D2 and Cinelike V2, that let you shoot log-like video with less hassle. Those deliver slightly more saturated colors and improved skin tones than the original Cinelike D and V modes.</p><p>Like other newer models, the GH5 II shows a red frame around the screen while recording, along with aspect ratio guides and a TikTok-style portrait video mode.  With the same sensor, the GH5 II has pretty much the same readout speeds, so as before, rolling shutter is present but well controlled.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/62cf1860-3730-11ec-bdff-8ba32f7298ca" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="f4a10862-ffc3-3dcf-89d3-c6a23d2b33a8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The GH5 II can now capture video simultaneously to an external recorder over the HDMI port, unlike the GH5. However, it can’t capture RAW video like the S5, for instance. Hopefully, that and the limited VLog-L dynamic range will be addressed in future firmware updates.</p><p>With all those tweaks, the GH5 II delivers sharp video with high levels of color accuracy for demanding work. It handles skin tones well and colors are natural and accurate. Low-light shooting is not its strong point, though, due to the smaller sensor size. For that, you’d be better off with either the GH5s or one of Panasonic’s newer full-frame models.</p><p>The new video quality changes are subtle, but could be helpful for certain types of work. Overall, it delivers the video quality everyone liked from the GH5, plus a little more.</p><h3>Live Streaming</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/53ed5270-3731-11ec-bf7f-1cc652ccecd8" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="de71b920-c14b-392f-9191-857baebd917e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>A key new feature for the GH5 II is the ability to broadcast live on the web, either using WiFi or a USB-C. The latter will require a firmware update that essentially allows the GH5 II’s USB-C port to be used as a wired LAN connection, however.</p><p>You can either stream to a smartphone via WiFi using the Lumix Sync app, or stream directly over WiFi without the need for a PC or phone. The latter requires you to use the Lumix Network software for PC or Mac to write your streaming settings to an SD card. Since it uses the RTMP/RTMPS standard, it supports YouTube, Facebook and other services. Better still, it supports camera audio as well as video.</p><p>Live streaming does require a robust connection, however, as I struggled to maintain a livestream in the countryside with a 16 Mbps connection. You won’t want to use the maximum 1080p 60 fps settings unless you have internet speed well above 16 Mbps.</p><h3>Photos</h3><section data-eng-breakout="ccd8c65a80324179a12754d860d7fb81" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/73100e40-3731-11ec-bdb5-7d64568fbb8e" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers"></section><p>With the same sensor as the GH5, the GH5 II delivers much the same image quality and photo shooting specs, including 12 fps burst shooting speeds. Where it has improved, though, is in the autofocus features, particularly with tracking.</p><p>The G9 was always a better photo camera than the GH5, as it had a noticeably quicker autofocus system. However, the GH5 II’s new processor means faster AF calculations, so the hit rate with continuous burst shooting is higher. It can also do face and eye tracking more quickly, and as with video, can handle head and body tracking, too.</p><p>With those changes, I was able to get more burst action shots in focus than I could with the GH5, whether shooting people, dogs or horses. At the same time, it tends to nail exposure more accurately than the original model.</p><p>Image quality is largely along the same lines as video, with low-light capability that gets pretty noisy above ISO 3200 or so, but sharp, color-accurate photos in good light. As before, it’s best not to let your highlights get too blown out as they’re difficult to recover when shooting RAW.</p><h3>Wrap-up</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/91c64ca0-3731-11ec-bedf-c47f454a2751" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="e7abee3b-dd6b-3694-ac4d-4ff286aab26c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The GH5 II is a worthy upgrade to the original, bringing enough improvements and new technology to justify its existence. Given that the all-new GH6 model is coming soon as well, it’s clear that Panasonic is still committed to small sensor, video-centric mirrorless cameras.</p><p>Video has modestly improved, and it’s better for handheld shooting thanks to the improved stabilization. Autofocus is still a drawback but it’s faster and more reliable than before. It would be nice if it supported RAW external capture, but that’s probably not a dealbreaker for most users. It can handle stills reasonably well, though it’s not the camera’s strong point.</p><p>Other cameras have caught up with the GH5 II in terms of video performance, but most, like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-r6-review-almost-perfect-140051632.html">Canon R6</a> ($2,500) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikons-latest-z-6-ii-firmware-unlocks-4-k-60-fps-recording-110552464.html">Nikon Z6 II</a> ($2,000) are more expensive. Fujifilm’s $1,700 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-t4-mirrorless-camera-review-140024236.html">X-T4</a> is a better choice if you want a larger sensor and shoot a lot of photos, but it lacks the streaming capabilities. Its biggest rival may be the original GH5 that can now be found for $1,300, if you don’t need the video streaming or other features. In any case, the GH5 II is now the best Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera for video. At least until the GH6 comes along.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-review-speed-streaming-powers-164600927.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e5cacee-5a87-4ea8-97fc-fccdd8fb90c4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:46:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635439037</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T16:37:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a2517240-372f-11ec-87bf-5e60fd7762ec" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a2517240-372f-11ec-87bf-5e60fd7762ec" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard ends forced arbitration for harassment and discrimination claims]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following months of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-activision-walkout-184945869.html#"><ins>pressure from employees and workers</ins></a>, Activision Blizzard says it will no longer employ forced arbitration in sexual harassment and discrimination claims. CEO Bobby Kotick announced the policy change in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211028005446/en/A-Letter-From-CEO-Bobby-Kotick-Regarding-Progress-and-Commitments-Made-at-Activision-Blizzard"><ins>letter to employees</ins></a> the company shared on Thursday. Kotick said the publisher will also implement a new company-wide zero-tolerance harassment policy. In the future, any employee who is found to have violated the rule will be fired immediately. Additionally, they’ll forfeit any future compensation, including equity awards.</p><p>“Our goal is to have the strictest harassment and non-retaliation policies of any employer, and we will continue to examine and tighten our standards to achieve this goal everywhere we do business,” Kotick said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The executive outlined three other steps Activision Blizzard will take to create a safer and more diverse workplace. Over the next 10 years, it will invest $250 million in programs that create opportunities in tech and gaming for under-represented communities. Additionally, the company to plans to hire more women and non-binary people. According to Kotick, approximately 23 percent of all employees at Activision Blizzard identify as part of those groups. Its goal is to increase that number by 50 percent to more than one-third across the entire company within the next five years. Kotick also promised the company will share annual reports on progress it makes toward pay equity.</p><p>Separately, the executive said he has asked Activision Blizzard’s board of directors to reduce his total compensation to $62,500 per year until it feels like he has met the diversity and safety goals outlined above.</p><p>Today’s announcement sees Kotick and Activision Blizzard meeting many of the <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1433466353726361603?s=20">demands</a> employees put before the company when they began protesting its actions in the wake of California’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html"><ins>sexual harassment lawsuit</ins></a>. When employees first staged a walkout in July, they demanded the end of forced arbitration, greater pay transparency and new hiring policies designed to increase representation across the company. “This is a great start, and there’s still work to do,” <a href="https://twitter.com/blizzjess/status/1453734464308211714">said Jessica Gonzalez</a>, one of the employees involved with the A Better ABK advocacy group. “We can lead the charge as an industry standard.

It earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-review-143012511.html">score of 87</a> from us and we considered it to be a steal at its normal $100 price point. Not only does it have solid sound quality on its own, but two paired together in stereo mode sound even better. We also like its minimalist design and how speedily the Google Assistant responds to commands.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Either of the Nest Hubs on sale would make great additions to your smart home, but which you choose will likely depend on how much you value affordability and sound quality. The second-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">Nest Hub</a> is a great deal at $50 because you&#39;re getting a faster device overall, much improved audio quality and new sleep tracking abilities. For the latter, if you put the Nest Hub next to your bed, it&#39;ll track how long you&#39;ve been asleep and even if you snore during the night. And regardless of where it sits in your home, the smart display can show video camera feeds from Nest Cams, so you can see who&#39;s at your front door without actually answering it.</p><p>As for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">Nest Hub Max</a>, it&#39;s the better choice if you want a smart display that can also hold its own against some high-end speakers. It includes two front-facing tweeters and a rear-facing woofer and they work together to pump out strong, clear sound. It&#39;s not a replacement for a couple of Sonos speakers spread throughout your home, but it&#39;s one of the best options if you want one device that can be your main speaker and smart display.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-hits-new-low-of-60-at-bh-photo-150717380.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0dc978d5-0f49-4380-b519-6402f20fc86a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 15:07:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635433780</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T15:09:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/31e02730-9bbd-11eb-bfaa-c7494697b3e8" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/31e02730-9bbd-11eb-bfaa-c7494697b3e8" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Audio smart speaker sitting on a wooden tablet next to a green plant, against a blue wall.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Nest Audio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple TV+ is coming to Comcast devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-apple-tv-app-amazon-fire-tv-stick.html">Apple TV app</a> has reached its final frontier: your cable provider&#39;s set-top box. <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/apple-tv-plus-comcast-xfinity-video-platforms-1235099517/">According</a> to <em>Variety</em>, Comcast used its latest <a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/events/event-details/q3-2021-comcast-corporation-earnings-conference-call">earnings call </a>to reveal that the Apple TV app will be available on Comcast&#39;s platforms in the &quot;coming months.&quot; Viewers with Xfinity X1 set-tops, Flex streaming hubs, XClass TVs and (in the UK and Europe) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sky-smart-tv-glass-comcast-095543008.html">Sky Glass</a> sets will have access to Apple TV+, in-app channels (like AMC+ and Showtime) and Apple&#39;s usual video purchases and rentals.</p><p>In exchange, Comcast is bringing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-14-comcasts-all-in-one-xfinity-stream-app-arrives-february-28th.html">Xfinity Stream</a> app to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">Apple TV hardware</a>.

But now you can get one of Shark&#39;s most advanced models for the lowest price we&#39;ve seen. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum" href="https://amzn.to/3GxOMfs">Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum</a> with clean base is 47 percent off, bringing it down to $319. That&#39;s more than $280 off its normal price and the lowest we&#39;ve seen it — not to mention that also makes it even cheaper than most iRobot devices that come with clean bases, even when they&#39;ve been on sale.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GxOMfs" id="6372afd8974f4916b8e5ff731b09b34f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Shark IQ RV1001AE at Amazon - $319</a><p>We&#39;ve been fans of Shark&#39;s robot vacuums since one of its cheaper models made it into our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a>. Originally priced at $600, the RV1001AE is one of Shark&#39;s higher-end robo-vacs with powerful suction and a self-cleaning brush roll. The latter ensures that hair won&#39;t get tangled in the brush, making this vacuum a good pick for pet owners. In addition to Shark&#39;s IQ navigation, it also maps out your home as it cleans so you can tell it to only clean the living room or the kitchen by using the mobile app. And if you don&#39;t want to bother with manual cleanings, you can set a schedule in the mobile app, too, and let the robot do all the work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This robot vacuum also cleans itself — it&#39;ll automatically empty its bin into the clean base that comes with it. Yes, you&#39;ll have to empty the base once every month or so, but that&#39;s much more convenient than having to remember to dump out the robot&#39;s contents every time. Also, Shark&#39;s clean base is bagless, so you don&#39;t have to buy proprietary liners like you do with other robots that come with similar bases.</p><p>If you can live without the clean base, a few other <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark vacuums" href="https://amzn.to/3vWWPh5">Shark vacuums</a> — both robot and not — are on sale right now, too. Of note is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark IQ AV970" href="https://amzn.to/3BoERVK">Shark IQ AV970</a>, which is down to $250. That&#39;s $150 off its normal price and close to its all-time low of $230. It has many of the same features as the RV1001AE, including a self-cleaning brush roll, IQ navigation and Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Aside from the clean base, you&#39;ll have to forgo home mapping with this model, but you&#39;ll get an extra-large dust bin, which allows the robot to suck up more dirt and debris before you need to empty it.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3BoERVK" id="48ede0ab78f840b4a37e423b3a503408" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Shark IQ AV970 at Amazon - $250</a><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sharks-self-emptying-robot-vacuum-is-nearly-half-off-today-133007846.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cdeb78bd-041e-4ff6-b4e3-bce586036334</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 13:30:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635425424</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T12:50:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8c41330-37ec-11ec-b3f1-fb67d2b61a26" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8c41330-37ec-11ec-b3f1-fb67d2b61a26" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shark]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[McDonald's and IBM could bring AI-powered drive-thrus to more restaurants]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>McDonald&#39;s might not be the only restaurant experimenting with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-10-mcdonald-plans-to-bring-ai-voice-technology-to-its-drive-thrus.html">AI-based order taking</a> in the near future. <em>Restaurant Dive</em><a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/mcdonalds-will-sell-mcd-tech-labs-to-ibm/608978/">reports</a> McDonald&#39;s is <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/ourstories.IBM-McD-Tech-Labs.html">selling</a> its McD Tech Labs to IBM in order to &quot;further accelerate&quot; work on its automated voice ordering systems.

While the fast food chain saw &quot;substantial benefits&quot; for both customers and staff, it was clear the system needed improvement. It was only about 85 percent accurate, necessitating human intervention for nearly a fifth of orders. CEO Chris Kempczinski said it would take more than a year or two to implement the technology on a broader scale, and indicated that McDonald&#39;s routinely bought companies (like the AI firm Apprente) for short stints before spinning them out with partners who can expand the technology — it clearly sees IBM as key to making AI drive-thrus a success, at McDonald&#39;s and elsewhere.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear whether or not restaurant employees should be thrilled.

It&#39;s <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/1028_mirrorless_01.htm">Nikon&#39;s first camera</a> to use a stacked sensor with built in memory that allows for very fast readout speeds. In fact, Nikon is so confident in the electronic shutter that it has abandoned the mechanical shutter entirely, so the Z9 is the first high-end professional camera without one.</p><p>With that high-speed sensor (which has the same megapixel count as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z7-ii-review-140054141.html">Z7 II</a>), the Z9 allows a flash sync of up to 1/200th of a second, which looks like the fastest sync speed ever for an electronic shutter. That should also make it very resistant to rolling shutter, which is crucial if the camera is to be used for sports or action photography.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The faster sensor allows JPEG burst shooting at up to 30 fps, or RAW photos at 20 fps. If you&#39;re willing to drop down to 11 megapixels, you can shoot photos at an astounding 120 fps. As with other stacked sensor cameras, the Nikon Z has much improved buffering, letting you capture up to 1,000 frames at once with either JPEG or the new HE (high efficiency) RAW compression algorithms.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9041d3a0-37ee-11ec-9d7f-3ffb91bd348b" alt="Nikon officially unveils the 45.7-megapixel Z9 with 8K video and 20 fps burst speeds" data-uuid="60437871-cff7-3b83-971e-066ba17897fe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>Nikon&#39;s autofocus (AF) system is also all-new, and makes even more extensive use of AI algorithms. Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canons-24-megapixel-eos-r-3-can-shoot-raw-photos-at-30-fps-100003365.html">Canon&#39;s EOS R3</a>, it can now track a wide range of subjects, including the eyes, faces and bodies of people, along with dogs, cats and birds, planes, trains, motorbike and bicycles. And unlike other AI cameras, there&#39;s no need to tell it what you&#39;re shooting — the camera will figure that out if you set it to &quot;Auto&quot; (or, you can set the subject type manually). It also offers a &quot;3D tracking&quot; system much like you can find on Nikon&#39;s DSLRs. All of this falls into line with the Z9&#39;s purpose as a sports/action/wildlife photography camera.</p><p>Nikon has also improved its in-body stabilization system (which it calls &quot;vibration reduction&quot; or VR). Now, it can combine in-body and lens stabilization system for steadier video or fewer blurry photos. This will only be available with several lenses to begin with, however, namely the Nikkor Z 70-200m F/2.8, Z MC 105mm f/2.8 VR and freshly announced Z 100-400mm F/4.5-5.6 VR S.&nbsp;</p><p>Video performance is equally impressive, as Nikon teased <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikons-z-9-with-8-k-video-capability-is-set-to-arrive-later-this-year-080539577.html">earlier this year</a>. The Z3 will be able to capture 8K at 30p at launch, along with oversampled 4K 30p from an 8K capture that should be incredibly sharp. If you don&#39;t mind pixel binning or line skipping, it will also be able to capture 4K at up to 120 fps.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="77040aec-9604-4f9c-8a84-61170e1f15d3"/><p>To start with, you&#39;ll be able to capture these formats at up to 10-bit with H.264 or H.265 long GOP codecs. On top of that, Nikon is offering the very useful option of capturing video with ProRes 422 HQ compression, which is much easier to edit straight out of the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Things will get even more interesting later on, though. Nikon plans to introduce a future firmware update that will enable 12-bit 8K 60fps capture in a new, proprietary N-RAW format or using Apple ProRes RAW HQ capture at 4K/60p. Nikon promises that you&#39;ll be able to capture the oversampled 4K/30p for more than two hours at &quot;normal&quot; temperatures.&nbsp;</p><p>The Z9 has a large pro-style body with controls about where you&#39;d expect them, other than a repositioned play button and AF button near the front. It uses dual CFexpress Type B slots (backward compatible with XQD) for maximum performance for video and burst photos. The new large, EN-EL18d battery is rated for up to 740 shots per charge with the LCD, or 700 shots with the EVF enabled.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/31f75680-37ee-11ec-bbf2-6c1cd8c748a7" alt="Nikon officially unveils the 45.7-megapixel Z9 with 8K video and 20 fps burst speeds" data-uuid="03854cbc-249c-311d-8db3-a17e8f5a5f10"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>It has a 3.69 million dot OLED viewfinder with just a 60 fps refresh rate, but Nikon said that it always delivers that speed and never downgrades it no matter what you&#39;re doing. It uses a multi-direction rear LCD and not a fully-articulating screen, but you can tilt t he screen up to face yourself.</p><p>With the Z9, Nikon has taken some of the best aspects of Canon&#39;s EOS R3 and the Sony A1 and married them into a single, large body. It falls a bit short of those models in terms of shooting speed, and the electronic viewfinder isn&#39;t too impressive on paper. However, Nikon seems to have vaulted ahead of both Sony and Canon in terms of video specs, particularly when the firmware update arrives — though we&#39;ll have to wait and see if video autofocus is up to snuff. The Nikon Z9 will arrive by the end of the year in the US at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$5,500" href="https://fave.co/3Eol6j9">$5,500</a> for the body only.&nbsp;</p><div id="2691fcb5a5d94a54957eaabab3572fce"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RzGxEJisrxw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Along with the camera, Nikon also launched two new apps, <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/1028_software_03.htm">NX MobileAir and NX Tether</a>. NX MobileAir allows photographers to transmit images to a smartphone at high speeds via USB cable, then upload them over 5G. It also supports image-editing functions like trimming and IPTC metadata editing. The NX Tether app, meanwhile, allows for tethered studio shooting so photos to be tweaked immediately after shooting.</p><p>Nikon also <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/1028_lens_02.htm">announced</a> a pair of zoom lenses, the Nikkor Z 24-120mm F/4 S and Nikkor Z 100-400mm F/4.5-5.6 models ($1,100 and $2,700 respectively), along with the FTZ II FX lens adapter. In addition, the company updated its Z <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/1028_lens_04.htm">lens roadmap</a> with a 400mm f/2.8 TC VR model and, down the road, 600mm and 800mm models. There&#39;s no word yet on when those will arrive.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nikon-officially-unveils-the-45-megapixel-z-9-with-8-k-video-and-20-fps-burst-speeds-125237569.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0ca215fb-7b49-411e-980b-c871f176bf6a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 12:52:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635432396</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T14:46:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5aa173f0-37ed-11ec-bb6a-878deca41d53" width="2000" height="1117" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5aa173f0-37ed-11ec-bb6a-878deca41d53" width="2000" height="1117" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nikon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nikon officially unveils the 45.7-megapixel Z9 with 8K video and 20 fps burst speeds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nikon officially unveils the 45.7-megapixel Z9 with 8K video and 20 fps burst speeds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Android 12L is Google's latest tablet effort]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google hasn’t given up on Android tablets.

Its latest software update <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/27/tesla-launches-remote-sentry-mode-live-view-premium-connectivity-feature/">includes</a> a feature called Sentry Mode Live Camera Access, which will allow owners to remotely view their car&#39;s surroundings when parked. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-09-teslas-sentry-mode-has-already-caught-a-suspected-carjacker.html">Sentry Mode</a> is Tesla&#39;s integrated surveillance system that uses a 360 dash cam to record damage and any attempted break-in. It has resulted to arrests of people who attempted to steal Teslas in the past, but owners haven&#39;t been able to use it to view their car&#39;s current surroundings until now.</p><p>In its update notes, Tesla says the live camera function is end-to-end encrypted and cannot be accessed by the company. To enable or disable it, owners need to go under Safety &amp; Security in Controls. According to <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/27/tesla-launches-remote-sentry-mode-live-view-premium-connectivity-feature/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, however, owners must have an active <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-07-tesla-starts-charging-for-premium-connectivity.html">Premium Connectivity</a> subscription to activate live view. The subscription package gives them access to satellite maps and live traffic visualizations, as well as media streaming and web browsing on data. It does cost $10 a month, but owners can sign up for free trial before paying for the service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At this point in time, live camera is only available to iOS users who can view the footage around their cars via Tesla&#39;s app. The automaker has unfortunately yet to announce when its Android app will also get the capability.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sentry-mode-live-view-091026473.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb29c7a7-e2d4-4aed-ab5c-28eaa3390aec</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 09:10:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635408644</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T08:10:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/38c3c450-0a2e-11ec-afef-cb72bb49b07f" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/38c3c450-0a2e-11ec-afef-cb72bb49b07f" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[winhorse via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hong Kong - August 13, 2021 : People walk past the Tesla official showroom in Queens Road East, Wan Chai, Hong Kong.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Showroom in Hong Kong]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony has sold 13.4 million PS5s]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony&#39;s PlayStation 5 sales remain relatively steady and strong, despite widespread supply shortages, with 3.3 million units sold in fiscal Q2 compared to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-ps5-10-million-sold-144729654.html">2.2 million last quarter</a>. That brought total sales up to 13.4 million units, Sony <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/archive.html">announced</a>. Game sales were also up significantly at 76.4 million units compared to 63.6 million in the previous quarter, due in large part to third-party sales.</p><p>All told, this amounted to a healthy 27 percent boost in gaming revenue to 645.4 billion yen ($5.68 billion). However, operating income of 82.7 billion yen ($728 million) was down compared to last quarter by 3.4 billion yen ($29 million). Sony&#39;s fiscal year ends on March 31, 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So how can profit be lower when sales and revenue are up? While Sony did sell more games last quarter, first-party titles dropped very significantly, from 10.5 million last quarter to 7.6 million in Q2. That was offset in numbers by third-party games, but those don&#39;t tend to be as profitable. Both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-buys-zenimax-bethesda-id-arkane-131006192.html">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-19-sony-interactive-snaps-up-spider-man-developer-insomniac-games.html">Sony</a> have acquired gaming studios to boost their Xbox/PS first-party titles, but Microsoft has been more prolific in that regard.&nbsp;</p><p>And while PS5 sales were up, PS4 units dropped considerably, down to just 200,000 from a half a million the quarter before. Other factors that Sony mentioned are a &quot;loss resulting from strategic price points for PS5 hardware that were set lower than manufacturing costs.&quot; That means that Sony may have sold the PS5 with minimal or negative profits this quarter as it attempted to navigate around chip shortages. However, in August, the company said it was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ps5-no-longer-selling-at-a-loss">no longer</a> selling the PS5 at a loss.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the drop in quarterly income, Sony&#39;s gaming division appears to be on pretty solid footing. In its August earnings call, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki told investors that its PS5 sales target is set higher than the 14.8 million unit sales achieved by the PlayStation 4 in its first year. Based on today&#39;s figures, PS5 sales are closely tracking that trajectory.</p><p>The company also said at the time that it had secured enough components for 22.6 million units sold by March 2022. That would be enough to meet its sales projections, but if sales really explode during the holidays, it may not have a lot of margin for error — meaning shortages could continue through next year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-134-million-ps5s-084114658.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2bab9ba0-b9da-4144-a72f-827bbb38dd55</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 08:41:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635420718</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T11:32:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/58115730-37c1-11ec-bfba-667c8280e1fd" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/58115730-37c1-11ec-bfba-667c8280e1fd" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony has sold 13.4 million PS5s]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony has sold 13.4 million PS5s]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Star Trek: Prodigy’ centers technology by focusing on those who don’t have it]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains moderate spoilers for the first episode and slight spoilers for episode two of ‘</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek: Prodigy" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/n12OYa"><em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em></a><em>.’</em></p><p>How do you make a series that can draw in newcomers while still appealing to long-time fans?

The idea is to keep Star Trek fans from dropping their subscriptions to Paramount+ during the downtime, something that was fairly common during <em>Discovery</em>’s first three seasons.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ef1a9730-3763-11ec-b5fe-7dc4933d8c37" style="height:1202;width:2910;" alt="Pictured: Environmental coverage of the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Prodigy .

And that’s where the deeper ties to Trek lore come in. Though Voyager spent seven years in the Delta Quadrant, the ship’s mission to get back to Federation space meant it couldn’t stick around in any one place too long, or return to previous locales. There’s a ton left to explore — as well as plenty of room for Prodigy’s creators, Dan and Kevin Hageman, to populate their own corner of the universe.</p><p>First, they have to introduce their main characters, and that’s what ‘Lost and Found’ is largely dedicated to doing. Our cast of misfits, led by Dal (voiced by Brett Gray), lives on a mining colony populated by prisoners and orphans. It’s the last place anyone would want to be, especially a Star Trek character, which is why the main drive is to just get off this bleak rock. But right away the series makes its point about being far from Federation space and technology, as the inhabitants can’t even talk to each other due to a lack of universal translators. That system has been how, for over 55 years, Star Trek has managed to populate its cast with aliens who all speak English. It’s the future! Different languages aren’t a problem!</p><div id="6ded429095d343f49f76765bc22e338f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-1VLAt_UjU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Except here, they are. It keeps the characters from even knowing each other’s names, which makes the discovery of the <em>USS Protostar</em> and its built-in translator the perfect opportunity for everyone to re-introduce themselves to each other and thus, to the audience. And, when Dal and Rocktok discover a lost Starfleet ship buried under the surface of the planet, the ship itself may fill them with awe, but it’s the translator that truly elicits the most enthusiastic reaction: Rocktok calls it “magic.” It’s a rather fitting introduction to a franchise with a goal to “seek out new life and new civilizations,” in how it puts the connection between these disparate aliens up front.</p><p>When I saw the pilot at New York Comic Con <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-first-look-183049340.html">a few weeks ago</a>, I compared it to shows like <em>Clone Wars</em> and <em>Rebels</em>. The Star Wars influence that J.J. Abrams brought to the Star Trek franchise is still present in <em>Prodigy</em>, notably in its action sequences and score, the latter composed by frequent Michael Giacchino collaborator Nami Melumad. Giacchino is best known for his work on various Pixar and Star Trek films, and he also supplies the main theme for <em>Prodigy</em>. You can hear his influence on Melumad’s score, which does a great job of blending a quirky style with the signature Trek leitmotifs.</p><div id="5654405eac214090b0555ebfac963ae8"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bm9Zv8D70hA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The final action sequence feels like pure Star Wars, as the <em>USS Protostar</em> makes its way off the planet and Dal is trapped on its hull, battling the villainous Drednok. The bad guy’s insect-like cyborg body reminds me of General Grievous — if the general could turn into a giant gun, that is. It’s the kind of thing that works best in CG and, like <em>Lower Decks</em> before it, <em>Prodigy</em> seems more than willing to embrace the extra freedom offered by animation as a medium. We’re long past the clunky microfiche displays and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_non-humanoids_(23rd_century)#Alfa_177_canine">cosplaying dogs</a> of the original series.</p><p>That freedom is probably best illustrated in the character of hologram Captain Janeway, voiced by Kate Mulgrew (of course). It’s been over 20 years since <em>Voyager</em> last graced the small screen, and Mulgrew has kept busy on shows like <em>Warehouse 13</em> and <em>Orange is the New Black</em>. But in the Star Trek universe, it’s only been six years (though an exact date is never given on-screen in <em>Prodigy</em>). Animation means they can easily erase the decades from Janeway without resorting to the creepy live-action simulacrums seen in <em>Rogue One</em> of Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia.</p><div id="75b15dc6009244ccb45c9541f1791597"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp2MfWFF2Wk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Hologram Janeway makes her debut at the end of today’s pilot episode, but she’ll make a much fuller appearance in next week’s ‘Starstruck.’ That’s where the new “cadets” get to explore the ship and learn more about the distant “Federation.” While there’s still plenty of banter and conflict between the characters, the real star of the second episode is the ship itself — what it looks like, and what it’s capable of. While there is a plot — which I won’t divulge details of — it serves as a showcase for all the different features of this new prototype ship. You can almost imagine Janeway as a car salesman, slapping the hood of the <em>Protostar</em> and saying “this baby’s warp core can travel to so many planets.”</p><p>Star Trek has always been a humanist franchise, devoted to exploring social themes and dilemmas. It also has a tendency to take its technology and the “post-scarcity utopia” for granted. <em>Prodigy</em> goes against the grain by showing from the start how technology can change lives.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-first-episode-lost-and-found-070033462.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28afb0c2-e566-46b9-b5b0-81b41cc36261</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 07:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635367336</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T20:42:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3509a530-3762-11ec-bfff-73234ee97e27" width="2910" height="1308" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3509a530-3762-11ec-bfff-73234ee97e27" width="2910" height="1308" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nickelodeon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pictured: Environmental coverage of the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Prodigy .

That&#39;s 10 percent higher from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-q3-2020-012410766.html">same period</a> last year. It also reported an operating profit of 15.82 trillion Korean won or U$13.5 billion, which is 26 percent higher than the previous quarter&#39;s.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the pandemic, the tech giant&#39;s semiconductor business posted 26.4 trillion won or US$22.6 billion in revenue, thanks to a strong demand for computers due to companies implementing work-from-home arrangements. Its DRAM sales, mainly for servers, continue to grow and is the leading factor for the division&#39;s stellar performance. Samsung says it was able to do business as usual despite the global shortage in chip components &quot;by flexibly operating its product mix.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to its chip business, Samsung&#39;s mobile division also contributed greatly to its record-breaking third quarter. It saw an improvement from the previous quarter, with its 28.42 trillion won or U$24.2 billion in revenue, thanks to strong sales of its mass-market lineup and its flagship models. The latter includes its new foldable devices, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-drops-to-850-at-amazon-samsung-week-deals-143712131.html">Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>, though the company admitted that the bigger marketing investments for its foldables affected the division&#39;s total profits.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s also thanks to the high demand for its phones that Samsung&#39;s display business was able to post 8.86 trillion won or US$7.5 billion in revenue. Display earnings were up from the previous quarter primarily due to the higher demand for small to medium OLED panels despite a sluggish demand for bigger panels.</p><p>Samsung remains optimistic for the fourth quarter, as well as for next year, but it didn&#39;t provide specific guidance for its chip business due to the ongoing component supply issue affecting various industries. It expects continued high demand for PCs and servers, nonetheless. For the fourth quarter specifically, it&#39;s expecting even higher earnings &quot;due to expanded supply of SoCs and related products for launches of new 5G smartphones in 2022.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-q3-earnings-chip-mobile-record-high-030342880.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83f6b95f-9f4c-4683-a1a2-39b51c55038d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 04:10:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635394309</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T04:11:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/11a79e70-d24b-11eb-be8f-cf4a23cb519b" width="4074" height="2716" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/11a79e70-d24b-11eb-be8f-cf4a23cb519b" width="4074" height="2716" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JHVEPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toronto, Canada - May 16, 2020: Samsung store at Eaton Centre in Toronto, Canada.

The newly <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-e803d79216fbe40bc5b04c733e09d303-the-mercedes-benz-sustaineer-an-innovation-driver-for-sustainable-urban-mobility">unveiled</a> Sustaineer delivery van concept is fully electric, as you&#39;d guess, but it also improves the environment around it. Fine particulate filters on the front and underbody purify the air around the van no matter what its speed. It even uses cast iron, ceramic-coated disc brakes that both reduce the amount of dust in the air and limit brake wear.</p><p>The Sustaineer also has solar panels on its roof to extend range and  reduce the need for plug-in charging (this sometimes contributes to CO2 emissions). It can further power devices whether or not the van is running, such as tools and laptops. Solar power on electrified vehicles is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-12-26-fisker-raises-karma-plug-in-hybrid-base-price-to-95-900-brings.html">nothing new</a>, but Mercedes clearly hopes implementations like this would keep EVs as green as possible.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other eco-conscious technology includes an energy-saving heating system that hews close to the body (including the seatbelt) and a heavy use of recycled materials. The filler is made from household waste, the cab partition is built from natural straw and the underbody includes recycled polypropylene and used tires. Mercedes lowers noise pollution, too, thanks to a quiet electric drivetrain, low rolling resistance tires and a hushed automatic delivery door.</p><p>Safety is a concern as well. A camera monitors road conditions to share reports of potholes and other hazards with cities, while digital mirrors provide a clearer field of view than you normally get with cargo vans. A &quot;biologically active&quot; light keeps the driver alert by filling the cab with illumination similar to daylight while maintaining a natural rhythm.</p><p>There are no mentions of plans to mass-produce the Sustaineer. With that said, Mercedes stressed that all the van&#39;s technology was crafted with large-scale production in mind. You might see this in other vans, not to mention other Mercedes vehicles. The company already has other green tech on the horizon, such as sustainable repairs for EV batteries in 2022, and Sustaineer is ultimately a logical extension of those plans.</p><div id="e505d0933d35491496070d00b00a7601"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6jazJy425o?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-sustaineer-electric-delivery-van-concept-215050891.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">65ef94cb-fabc-489e-b6a9-df9aba6cef19</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 21:50:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635370266</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T21:31:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/58b71c70-3766-11ec-b9ff-5fb3824b8b74" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/58b71c70-3766-11ec-b9ff-5fb3824b8b74" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mercedes Sustaineer electric delivery van concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mercedes Sustaineer electric delivery van concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zelda-like 'Death's Door' heads to PlayStation and Switch on November 23rd]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Death&#39;s Door</em>, one of the best indie games to come out earlier this year, is heading to PlayStation consoles.

The automaker has <a href="https://www.volvogroup.com/en/news-and-media/news/2021/oct/news-4100018.html">unveiled</a> an autonomous wheel loader prototype, the LX03, that&#39;s based on a Lego model — 42081 Lego Technic Concept Wheel Loader Zeux, if you&#39;re looking for it. The machine can haul 5 tons and can make its own decisions in a wide variety of situations, including team-ups with human workers.&nbsp;</p><p>The LX03 is also uniquely modular. Volvo can make &quot;just one or two changes&quot; to produce a larger or smaller loader to meet a customer&#39;s demands.

It should be available for a typical workday, then.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The prototype isn&#39;t indicative of a production model.

It&#39;s a pretty straightforward feature, but it&#39;s the sort of thing that could encourage more people to install and use their apps.&nbsp;</p><p>Hopefully, developers won&#39;t rely on it as a spammy way to rack up engagement. Many mobile gamers would love to know when they can log on for special item drops, for example. And if you encounter a particularly intriguing upcoming event, you can also create a notification or calendar reminder of when it begins.

Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel has <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-consider-text-988-expand-suicide-prevention-services">proposed</a> an order that would let people text 988 to reach the Lifeline. Carriers would have to automatically route texts to 988 to the Lifeline&#39;s full number (1-800-273-8255) no later than July 16th, 2022. Providers would have to support every messaging format the Lifeline can handle, and the FCC would explore the possibility of texting the Veterans Crisis Line.</p><p>The move would not only accommodate younger people more familiar with texting, but would make the Lifeline more accessible to people with disabilities, according to the FCC. The regulator also suggested this would offer a &quot;certain level of anonymity&quot; for people who aren&#39;t comfortable with phone conversations. The FCC will hold a vote on the proposal at its November 18th meeting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Lifeline already supports <a href="https://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/">online chats</a> through the web.

Specifically, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-zhurong-rover-selfie-photo-212920780.html">China&#39;s selfie-taking Zhurong rover</a>, which has been on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnsa-zhurong-rover-095207429.html">Red Planet since May</a>, will try to shoot data over to the ESA&#39;s Mars Express Orbiter.&nbsp;</p><p>As the<a href="https://blogs.esa.int/mex/2021/10/27/mars-express-keeps-an-ear-out-for-chinese-rover/"> ESA explains</a>, Zhurong can&#39;t actually receive any communications from the Express Orbiter, due to a radio incompatibility. That means it can&#39;t hear the hail signal sent from the orbiter, which is typically what a rover waits for before it starts sending out data. Instead, next month Mars and the ESA will attempt a new method that&#39;s previously only been tested on Earth. During five tests, Zhurong will send a signal blindly into space, and the Mars Express will listen for that signal and any potential data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;If [Mars Express] detects the magic signal, the radio will lock on to it and begin recording any data,&quot; <a href="https://blogs.esa.int/mex/2021/10/27/mars-express-keeps-an-ear-out-for-chinese-rover/">ESA&#39;s Josh Tapley writes</a>. &quot;At the end of the communication window, the spacecraft will turn to face Earth and relay these data across space the same way it does for other scientific Mars missions. When the data arrive at ESOC, they will be forwarded on to the Zhurong team for processing and analysis.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s not unusual for rovers to send data to foreign orbiter — that&#39;s commonly been seen as a smart backup method — but this test opens the door for communication between incompatible systems. That&#39;ll be useful if China has any issues with its Tianwen-1 orbiter down the line, or if the US and other countries need help in turn.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/esa-mars-express-china-zhurong-rover-test-190629849.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a59b8ee-55f6-44c9-8f8e-6229a2011956</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 19:06:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635363064</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T19:31:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/036ed3c0-3757-11ec-bdb6-4770ac15da6d" width="1200" height="498" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/036ed3c0-3757-11ec-bdb6-4770ac15da6d" width="1200" height="498" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CNSA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[China's Zhurong rover and Tianwen-1 lander]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[China's Zhurong rover and Tianwen-1 lander]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Olympus cameras will be rebranded as OM System]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/olympus/"><ins>Olympus cameras</ins></a> are getting a new name.
