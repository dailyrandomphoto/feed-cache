According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/21/trump-truth-social-fake-accounts/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, someone signed up for an account on the test website, took the username &quot;donaldjtrump&quot; and posted a photo of a defecating pig.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump and his team recently announced that they&#39;re launching TRUTH Social in early 2022 and that beta tests will begin in November. In its announcement, the team said that the platform is part of its efforts to fight against &quot;the Big Tech companies of Silicon Valley, which have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The test website has already been pulled down, but not before one of the publication&#39;s reporters was able to sign up under the name &quot;mikepence&quot; without encountering any safeguards that would prevent them from doing so. Based on the mock photos on its <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/truth-social/id1586018825">App Store listing</a>, TRUTH Social looks like a Twitter clone, where users can post &quot;Truths&quot;similar to tweets and repost &quot;Re-Truths,&quot; which are basically retweets. It has a news feed called the Truth Feed and a notification system, as well.</p><p>The website&#39;s code shows that it runs on a mostly unmodified version of open source software Mastodon, <em>The Post </em>says. Mastodon founder Eugen Rochko told <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgm5k/truth-social-is-mastodon-trump"><em>Vice</em></a> that the platform might be violating its licensing rules, since it requires developers to share any modification with the public and to give credit by linking to the original source code. The test website didn&#39;t just reveal TRUTH Social&#39;s code, though, but also its <a href="https://truthsocial.com/terms-of-service/">terms of service</a>. A sub-section in the ToS shows that the website hopes to be protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act.</p><p>Part of the ToS reads: &quot;[W]e are not responsible for any Third-Party Websites accessed through the Site or any Third-Party Content posted on, available through, or installed from the Site, including the content, accuracy, offensiveness, opinions, reliability, privacy practices, or other policies of or contained in the Third-Party Websites or the Third-Party Content.&quot;</p><p>Trump has been a very vocal critic of Section 230. In 2020, he <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-executive-order-social-media-section-230-144905272.html">signed</a> an executive order meant to limit its scope shortly after Twitter fact-checked a false tweet he made. The order was never meaningfully imposed, but President Biden <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-revokes-trump-social-media-executive-order-170713081.html">revoked</a> it completely back in May.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/trump-social-network-defaced-124507041.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9989f09-d5bb-4d38-9efb-6ebd0e188907</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 12:45:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634906092</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T12:35:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/22320b60-332e-11ec-bdcc-97b6e0802ed9" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/22320b60-332e-11ec-bdcc-97b6e0802ed9" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TRUTH Social]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TRUTH Social]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TRUTH Social]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: Apple’s new MacBook Pros, the Pixel 6 and the Surface Duo 2]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Techtober continues with a deep dive into Apple’s latest MacBook Pros, powered by the new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips.

cases]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/lyft-shared-rides-return-133317382.html">Lyft</a> has finally published its <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/q8mvene1wzq4/4jxkFTH5YCQK8T96STULMd/4269e14dbcb8578ff64da45df08b8147/Community_Safety_Report.pdf">first safety report</a> (PDF), which sheds light on the rate of sexual assault and abuse cases on the service in the US over the course of three years. From 2017 until 2019, Lyft received a total of 4,158 sexual assault reports. The company&#39;s safety team divided all sexual assault and misconduct incidents into 21 categories, but the cases included in this report only include five of the most serious categories of sexual assault.</p><p>Those categories are non-consensual kissing of a non-sexual/sexual body part, non-consensual touching of a sexual body part, attempted non-consensual sexual penetration and non-consensual sexual penetration. There are lesser categories of sexual assault that weren&#39;t included in the total number of cases.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Among the five, the most commonly reported incidents fall under the non-consensual touching of a sexual body part category. The team recorded 360 incidents of rape within that period. Lyft said that it included any incident reported over the three-year period regardless of when it actually happened, because sexual assault is chronically underreported. Further, it intentionally used broad definitions for the sub-categories.In addition to sexual assault cases, Lyft has also reported 105 motor vehicle fatalities and 10 fatal physical assaults.&nbsp;</p><p>The company explained that it doesn&#39;t proactively report safety incidents to law enforcement, knowing that it&#39;s a deeply personal decision, especially for survivors of sexual assault. &quot;This policy gives survivors as much agency as possible when deciding whether and how to report an incident,&quot; it wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Lyft has been promising to release a safety report since 2018, and when <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/11/tech/lyft-sexual-assault-incidents-safety/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a> asked about it earlier this year, the company cited an issue with the California Public Utilities Commission for the delay. According to the news organization, at least 72 individuals are suing the ride-hailing service over alleged sexual assault incidents. Some of those cases accuse Lyft of knowing that its drivers were raping passengers and failing to take steps to protect its customers.</p><p>Uber, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-05-uber-safety-report-2019.html">published</a> its first safety report in 2019. The company revealed nearly 6,000 reports of sexual abuse over 2017 and 2018, as well as 19 fatal physical assaults.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lyfts-first-safety-report-4000-sexual-assault-cases-113547009.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">50ff70e6-432a-4ed8-82bb-613f36883025</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 11:35:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634903718</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T11:55:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/daed37d0-d019-11e9-bfff-fe77cba38ab3" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/daed37d0-d019-11e9-bfff-fe77cba38ab3" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[jetcityimage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Las Vegas - Circa June 2019: Lyft Las Vegas Hub.

Borrowing technology from the recent A1 and A7S III models, it has some substantial improvements over the A7 III introduced well over three years ago. There’s an all-new 33-megapixel sensor, 4K 10-bit 60 fps video, new AI autofocus tricks and a lot more, including some new live streaming and sharing features, though they&#39;re not quite up to the level we&#39;ve seen on other recent cameras. You can do video and audio streaming over USB-C at up to 1080p 60 or 4K 15p if resolution is a priority over smooth video.</p><p>The A7 IV is clearly a massive leap forward for Sony&#39;s &quot;basic&quot; full-frame mirrorless camera series, putting it on par — or ahead of — most rivals. The only deterrent is the $2,500 price tag ($2,699 with a kit lens), which is $500 more than the A7 III cost at launch.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-camera-arrives-with-a-33-megapixel-sensor-and-4k-60p-video-141301936.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-buy-a-monitor-143000069.html">How to buy a monitor in 2021</a></h2><h3>We help you narrow down the multitude of choices available.</h3><h3></h3><p>With the pandemic still upon us and Work From Home directives continuing, a monitor is one of the most important computer buying decisions you can make.

The Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) said it <a href="https://www.forensischinstituut.nl/actueel/nieuws/2021/10/21/opgeslagen-data-in-autos-bevatten-een-schat-aan-informatie-voor-strafrechtelijke-onderzoeken">discovered</a> a wealth of information about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">Tesla&#39;s Autopilot</a>, along with data around speed, accelerator pedal positions, steering wheel angle and more. The findings will allow the government to &quot;request more targeted data&quot; to help determine the cause of accidents, the investigators said.&nbsp;</p><p>The researchers already knew that Tesla vehicles encrypt and store accident related data, but not which data and how much. As such, they reverse-engineered the system and succeeded in &quot;obtaining data from the models S, Y, X and 3,&quot; which they described in a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355202701_Reverse_engineering_and_evaluation_of_Tesla_vehicle_logs">paper</a> presented at an accident analysis conference.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>These data contain a wealth of information for forensic investigators and traffic accident analysts and can help with a criminal investigation after a fatal traffic accident or an accident with injury.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>With knowledge of how to decrypt the storage, the NFI carried out tests with a Tesla Model S so it could compare the logs with real-world data. It found that the vehicle logs were &quot;very accurate,&quot; with deviations less than 1 km/h (about 0.6 MPH).</p><p>The NSI also analyzed several accidents using the raw data it acquired. In one case, a Tesla on Autopilot collided with a car ahead that suddenly braked. Normally, if the Autopilot doesn&#39;t brake in time, the driver is supposed to take over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;In this case, the investigation showed that the driver did indeed intervene and also within the expected response time,&quot; said researcher Aart Spek. &quot;The fact that it turned out to be a collision was because the following distance [chosen by Autopilot] was too tight in the busy traffic situation. That makes it interesting, because who is responsible for the following distance: the car or the driver?&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>It used to be possible to extract Autopilot data from Tesla EVs, but it&#39;s now encrypted in recent models, the investigators said. Tesla encrypts data for good reason, they acknowledged, including protecting its own IP from other manufacturers and guarding a driver&#39;s privacy. It also noted that the company does provide specific data to authorities and investigators if requested.</p><p>However, the team said that the extra data they extracted would allow for more detailed accident investigations, &quot;especially into the role of driver assistance systems.&quot; It added that it would be ideal to know if other manufacturers stored the same level of detail over long periods of time. &quot;If we would know better which data car manufacturers all store, we can also make more targeted claims through the courts or the Public Prosecution Service,&quot; said NFI investigator Frances Hoogendijk. &quot;And ultimately that serves the interest of finding the truth after an accident.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/a-dutch-government-lab-has-decoded-teslas-driving-data-for-the-first-time-085709633.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">86656c1a-4e8c-47d9-af9f-936a46c5e455</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 22 Oct 2021 08:57:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634893032</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T08:57:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transport Accident]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/30c656f0-3314-11ec-9fef-cc5a379c050a" width="1600" height="1008" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/30c656f0-3314-11ec-9fef-cc5a379c050a" width="1600" height="1008" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Dutch government lab has decoded Tesla's driving data for the first time]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[A Dutch government lab has decoded Tesla's driving data for the first time]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SpaceX's SN20 Starship prototype completes its first static fire test]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX has taken a major step towards sending the Starship to orbit.

According to <a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-prototype-sn20-first-static-fire-video"><em>Space</em></a>, the SN20 is currently outfitted with two Raptor engines: A standard &quot;sea-level&quot; Raptor and a vacuum version designed to operate in space. At 8:16PM Eastern time on Thursday, the company fired the latter. SpaceX then revealed on Twitter that it was the first ever firing of a Raptor vacuum engine integrated onto a Starship.</p><div id="c7ca2dd9691a43e8b43b86aa99ef66a0"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">First firing of a Raptor vacuum engine integrated onto a Starship <a href="https://t.co/uCNAt8Kwzo">pic.twitter.com/uCNAt8Kwzo</a></p>— SpaceX (@SpaceX) <a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1451350259729420288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Around an hour after that, the SN20 lit up yet again in a second static fire test that may have involved both Raptor engines. The SN20 will eventually have six Raptors — three standard and three vacuum — and will be the first prototype to attempt an orbital launch. A Starship launch system is comprised of the Starship spacecraft itself and a massive first-stage booster called the Super Heavy. Both are designed to be reusable and to carry large payloads for trips to low and higher Earth orbits.

As we mentioned in our review, the main difference between this device and the Series 6 is its slightly bigger display, Now, iFixit&#39;s teardown shows that its display uses touch-integrated OLED panel or &quot;on-cell touch,&quot; which debuted with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The website says the move is unusual for Apple, since it typically introduces new display tech — such as OLED, always-on and variable refresh rate — on the lower-volume Apple Watch first instead of the other way around. According to the former Apple engineers iFixit worked with for this teardown, this new display may have caused production delays and made the company release the device later than it would&#39;ve liked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When the tech giant first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-supercut-201538409.html">announced</a> the Series 7 in September, it didn&#39;t have a concrete release date. The former Apple engineers said that usually signals delays, and the most likely culprit was the manufacturing hiccups caused by the Watch&#39;s display. &quot;[S]creens have some of the most complex supply chains and assembly processes in the industry,&quot; the website explained. In addition to using new technology, Apple also made the display bigger and gave it a refractive edge to make the sides look like they&#39;re slightly curved.&nbsp;</p><p>iFixit also found that the model&#39;s battery is larger than its predecessors. That doesn&#39;t translate to longer battery life, though, since the device&#39;s larger screen likely uses more power. There are a few other more minor changes compared to previous versions of the Watch.

Per <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/21/technology/amazon-workers-union-staten-island.html"><em><ins>The New York Times</ins></em></a>, hourly workers at the company’s JFK8 fulfillment center in New York City are in the process of collecting signatures to file for a union election. They’re expected to contact the National Labor Relations Board on Monday. If the agency grants their request, it will lead to a vote with potentially significant ramifications for Amazon.</p><p>This past April, Amazon beat back a historic union vote at its BHM1 fulfillment center in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-vote-154741754.html"><ins>Bessemer, Alabama</ins></a>. Approximately 1,700 of the more than 3,000 employees who took part in the election voted against unionization, handing Amazon a comfortable majority. However, the election was mired in controversy, with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which sought to represent the approximately 5,800 workers at Bessemer, accusing the company of unfairly influencing the vote. In August, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Amazon had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-found-to-have-illegally-discouraged-union-organizing-in-alabama-035214235.html"><ins>violated US labor laws</ins></a>, and recommended that workers in Bessemer hold a new election.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon employs more than 5,000 workers at JFK8. Beyond its sheer size, the facility has been the site of multiple protests since the start of the pandemic. Among those leading the unionization effort at JFK8 is Christian Smalls. Amazon fired Smalls after he organized a walkout over the company’s handling of COVID safety at the warehouse. At the time, the company said Smalls broke a quarantine order by attending the event. At the start of the year, New York <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sued-by-new-york-over-flagrant-disregard-for-covid-19-safety-115013292.html">sued Amazon</a>, alleging the company had retaliated against Smalls.</p><p>When Engadget reached out to Amazon about the effort, the company noted its employees have always had the option to join a union but said it was against the idea.</p><blockquote><p>As a company, we don’t think unions are the best answer for our employees. Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes — quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle. The benefits of direct relationships between managers and employees can’t be overstated — these relationships allow every employee’s voice to be heard, not just the voices of a select few. We’ve made great progress in recent years and months in important areas like pay and safety. There are plenty of things that we can keep doing better, and that&#39;s our focus — to keep getting better every day.</p></blockquote><p>Even if the National Labor Relations Board calls an election after Monday, the workers at JFK8 face an uphill battle. They’re up against one of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful corporations. From competitive wages to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-amazon-anti-union-ads-212739548.html"><ins>Twitch ads</ins></a>, Amazon has consistently used nearly every tool available to it to dissuade its workers from unionizing.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-staten-island-warehouse-unionization-drive-193814629.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">46a651b5-9d48-4c52-8eae-90ccb13fd1fd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 19:38:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634845059</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T19:37:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Unions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/c7afb1f0-3415-11eb-bff7-93bacb6e4452" width="3793" height="2529" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/c7afb1f0-3415-11eb-bff7-93bacb6e4452" width="3793" height="2529" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An employee scans packages at Amazon's JFK8 distribution center in Staten Island, New York, U.S. November 25, 2020.

The transparent design and RGB lighting give it a bit of flash (this is a Razer product, after all), but the highlight is a dual-fan active air filtration system with N95 filters.

While it&#39;s arriving relatively late in to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many places that still require masks, some of which might mandate that protection for a while to come. The Zephyr could help people in those areas feel more comfortable in public, particularly if they&#39;re already Razer enthusiasts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-zephyr-face-mask-release-date-193032958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">75517599-f156-47e6-80cd-4f0215f888fe</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 19:30:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634843500</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T19:11:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c2dbed10-329d-11ec-a77f-130ccbfff8ea" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c2dbed10-329d-11ec-a77f-130ccbfff8ea" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Razer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Razer Zephyr face mask]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer Zephyr face mask]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AMD and Microsoft issue fixes for Ryzen CPU slowdowns on Windows 11]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">released Windows 11</a> earlier this month, AMD warned that the OS <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-windows-11-bug-ryzen-100550246.html"><ins>could slow down apps</ins></a> on systems with Ryzen processors.

Sure, you can buy gaming headsets and gaming mice and gaming keyboards, but there are also gamer hoodies and gamer drinks and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-pre-order-shipping-145328930.html">gamer furniture</a>. Chairs made especially for playing have been proliferating over the past few years and until now, they’ve tended to be overpriced and ostentatious. Razer’s new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Enki chair" href="https://fave.co/2XyeIpM">Enki chair</a> is still a bit over the top, but at least it’s a more affordable over the top, starting at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$299" href="https://fave.co/3ppASWJ">$299</a>.</p><p>To build the Enki, Razer called in ergonomics experts, paying attention not just to lumbar support, but also to how test subjects sat on the bottom cushion. The 21-inch-wide seat is shaped to distribute your weight more evenly, so you can sit for hours without getting a sore ass. They even considered the needs of those who like to sit in more unusual positions, like a half- or full-lotus. As someone who often sits cross-legged in my chair, I am grateful for the extra space and support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="7f9ca757-9509-45dd-8f32-eb68174ade44"/><p>Perhaps the most impressive thing about the chair is how far back it can lean. It’s not quite 180 degrees, but 152 degrees is still pretty good — the kind of angle you might only see on an airliner’s international business class. It’s the kind of chair you can fall asleep in. It seems precarious but in use, the chair held my weight well when I opened it to its max. It didn’t feel too top heavy, like it would fall backward, but it felt a bit unnatural due to the lack of a footrest. But let’s be honest, you really should just retire to your couch or bed when you need a proper snooze. This is good for when you need a bit of a stretch between <em>Overwatch</em> matches or Zoom meetings.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eeacfe00-31e1-11ec-bfdb-706099ddf858" alt="Razer Enki from rear" data-uuid="19d9c932-54a4-33b1-9041-09aa588bb812"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>My one nitpick besides the lack of a footrest is the head pillow, which is only included with a more expensive $399 package. It’s a nice shape and the fabric feels good to the touch, but it’s also not very adjustable. It has to be strapped on around the moon-shaped cut out toward the top of the seat, which means the height is non-negotiable. I found it ended up in that limbo between my head and neck, where it just jutted out and supported neither of them. I found it incredibly uncomfortable and ended up tearing it off. However, it also felt weird to not have something supporting my head in this chair.

It’s a pact between some of the biggest companies in tech, including Google, Amazon and Apple, that aims to bring standardization to the fragmented smart home space. When it launches in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-delayed-164447784.html"><ins>first half of 2022</ins></a>, it will support a variety of voice assistants and networking protocols, including Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri as well as WiFi, Thread and Bluetooth LE.</p><p>At its simplest, the promise of Matter is that you’ll be able to buy a new device and it will simply work with your existing smart home setup. To support that vision, Google is introducing new tools to help developers build and integrate Matter devices into its wider smart home ecosystem. It starts with a new but familiar name for the company’s smart home devices and developer platform: Google Home. “By bringing our platform and tools under the same roof, it gives us a simpler way to show you why and how integrating your devices with Google Home makes them more accessible and helpful across the Google ecosystem,” the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of the rebranding, will launch a redesigned Developer Center early next year. It says the dashboard will include everything developers need to build devices and applications that work with the wider Google Home ecosystem. It will support Matter at launch and Google will release two software development kits. The first of those is a Google Home Device SDK. The company says it will be one of the fastest ways to create Matter devices. Google also plans to update Nest and Android devices to support the protocol, a move it says will enable the seamless setup of Matter devices on those platforms. Once it rolls out the update, Google claims the process of adding a new smart home will be as easy as connecting a new set of headphones. One of the other ways the company hopes to support developers is by allowing them to create their own suggested routines.</p><p>For Google, the motive for doing all of this is straightforward. The easier it can make it for third-party developers to integrate their devices and applications with Google Home, the better experience consumers will find. In turn, they’ll be more likely to invest in the company’s ecosystem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-home-matter-developer-center-170049360.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">300a2bf6-ddac-49ef-92fe-ca60b3c4bb7a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 17:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634833932</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T16:32:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f7484de0-fd1a-11eb-8eb4-4d8ac557fa35" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f7484de0-fd1a-11eb-8eb4-4d8ac557fa35" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Connectivity Standards Alliance]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Matter smart home devices]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Matter smart home devices]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google starts licensing Stadia tech to other companies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-game-studios-shut-down-montreal-los-angeles-201811811.html"><ins>shut down</ins></a> its internal <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/stadia"><ins>Stadia</ins></a> game development studios earlier this year, Stadia general manager Phil Harrison said the company planned to &quot;work with partners seeking a gaming solution all built on Stadia’s advanced technical infrastructure and platform tools.&quot; We&#39;re starting to see that strategy in action, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> is now licensing Stadia tech to other companies.</p><p>As first reported by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/20/batman-arkham-knight-white-label-stadia-att/"><em><ins>9to5 Google</ins></em></a> and confirmed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/google-stadia-white-label-arkham-knight-free"><em><ins>IGN</ins></em></a>, AT&amp;T is using the tech to offer wireless subscribers the chance to stream<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-23-batman-arkham-knight-never-feels-too-big-to-play.html"><em><ins>Batman: Arkham Knight</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(which isn&#39;t available on Stadia proper) for free.

Seagate has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/21/new-seagate-storage-expansion-cards/">introduced</a> a 2TB Storage Expansion Card that, for the Series X, effectively triples the capacity for next-gen games. It will cost $400 when it arrives in early December — nearly as much as the console itself — but might be worthwhile if you bristle at the thought of deleting games to make space.</p><p>There&#39;s also an option for those who need just a slight bump. Seagate is launching a 512GB card in mid-November, with pre-orders open now <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=productpost2021&amp;subId3=Preorder-Xbox-Seagate-SSD&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F678305132">for $139</a>. That&#39;s still not a trivial expense, but it could be compelling if you either have an Xbox Series S (and want to keep costs down) or just want a little more breathing room on a Series X.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The high prices are, for now, difficult to avoid. As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">with the PlayStation 5</a>, the Xbox Series X/S requires external storage as fast as the built-in SSD if you&#39;re going to run the latest games. That leaves vendors like Seagate little choice but to use cutting-edge NVMe drives. It won&#39;t be surprising if prices drop as the costs of the technology come down, but that might not happen for a while yet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/seagateo-2tb-storage-expansion-card-xbox-series-x-s-152738919.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e660e8c-2b6a-4b9c-aab5-885da485de4c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 15:27:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634866474</ingested><modified>2021-10-22T01:34:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Venture Capital]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/68acd220-327d-11ec-bfe3-34b7bbc0dbc1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/68acd220-327d-11ec-bfe3-34b7bbc0dbc1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Seagate/Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Seagate 512GB 1TB and 2TB Storage Expansion Card options for Xbox Series X and S]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Seagate 512GB 1TB and 2TB Storage Expansion Card options for Xbox Series X and S]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
