For years, they’ve largely looked the same — plastic or metal rectangles attached to some generic silicone or nylon strap.</p><p>Fitbit likes to say its wearables resemble jewelry. But it’s difficult to make a fitness tracker that <em>actually</em> looks like jewelry and does everything from logging your steps, sleep and workouts to telling you to breathe and relax. The company tried its hand at a stylish fitness band in 2016 with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-18-fitbit-alta-review.html">the Alta</a>, but that device was <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/fitbit-alta,review-3476.html">just a slightly narrower Charge</a> with a finicky screen and has since been discontinued. With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-luxe-price-specs-available-buy-now-170015159.html">the Luxe</a>, Fitbit is singing a familiar tune, once again promising a “fashion-forward fitness and wellness tracker... in an effortlessly chic bracelet design.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Design aside, the Luxe packs almost everything you’d want from a fitness band: a heart rate sensor, oxygen saturation (SpO2) monitoring, sleep tracking, water resistance and basic syncing with your phone. <a href="https://bit.ly/3wvT5Sz">At $150</a>, this could be a great option for those looking for a simple no-frills tracker that stands out from the crowd.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Fitbit’s previous claims about how stylish and chic their trackers are have been questionable. They’re all just rectangular blocks with few minor variations. When announcing the Luxe, the company painstakingly detailed how it crafted the Luxe’s case, saying the device’s “breakthrough design has a soft, gentle shape inspired by the human body that sits lightly on your wrist with a jewelry-like look and feel.”</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f85c46bf-a02b-43c3-9c9c-f64b6ec0beee"/><p>It used techniques like metal injection molding to make the stainless steel case, “providing the warmth expected of handcrafted jewelry, all while delivering a level of precision needed to enable its advanced sensor technology.” After throwing in a few dozen mentions of how elegant the Luxe is, the company ends up calling this “one of Fitbit’s most fashionable and comfortable devices yet.”</p><p>Co-founder James Park said “We’ve made major technological advancements with Luxe, creating a smaller, slimmer, beautifully designed tracker packed with advanced features – some that were previously only available with our smartwatches.” Meaning that Fitbit was able to squeeze advanced components into the teeny tiny body of the Luxe, which is about as wide as my index finger and just 1.43 inches long. It’s indeed very small and thin, with a profile of 0.4 inches. That’s about as thick as the Apple Watch SE, but about a third of the width. It’s also about three quarters as wide as a Fitbit Charge 4, and a <em>hair</em> thinner.</p><p>So yes, the Luxe is a dainty little thing, which is nice for people like me who have small wrists. The stainless steel case itself is slightly curved along the edges, making it less blockish than the Charge 4 and the Alta. But the strap you pick can make all the difference. When paired with the silicone option you get in the box, the Luxe still looks kinda basic. Swap it out for, say, the Gold Mesh version that Fitbit also sent me, and voila! Instant style elevation.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca53-e04a-11eb-bfbe-34293ec4dd7b" alt="Slight off angle view of the Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist against a dark brown background with some greenery. The screen shows the time is 6:30pm." data-uuid="3a917e9c-2db0-3ac6-be59-239b2432207f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That’s nice, but you could make most other fitness trackers look attractive by swapping in a pretty band. Where the Luxe stands out is in its dainty size and narrow width, and that’s good news for those of us who want something smaller. The added bonus of the Luxe’s footprint is that it never got in the way when I was typing or performing a handstand.</p><p>The bad thing about the Luxe’s size is that its screen is correspondingly small. This is a 0.76-inch AMOLED panel running at a 124 x 206 resolution. It’s surrounded by a thick bezel, which is probably hiding all the Luxe’s sensors. But this makes things like your workout stats very hard to read. The screen itself is crisp, bright and colorful. But if you have trouble reading tiny text, you might need a bigger device. Fitbit told Engadget that an update is coming soon that will include larger text, though we still don’t know the specific timeline nor how this will look when it rolls out.</p><h2>Navigation and in use</h2><p>Like the Charge 4 and Sense smartwatch, the Luxe has no physical buttons. But unlike the other two, this tracker doesn’t even have an inductive solid state sensor that detects pressure to trigger an action. The only way you’ll be interacting with the Luxe is through its touchscreen. Thankfully, Fitbit uses a standard one here instead of its faux touchscreen that you had to forcefully jab for it to detect a tap. With the Luxe, you can swipe and tap on the screen just like on any smartwatch, albeit with a very rudimentary OS.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca54-e04a-11eb-a6ef-45af42b261f4" alt="The Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist leaning on a wet railing. The screen is off." data-uuid="29c8f4de-5397-3e5e-b521-cf20b7189d79"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Swiping up from the main screen shows your daily progress and battery percentage, while dragging down lets you access Settings and enable Do Not Disturb, Sleep or Water Lock modes. Swiping sideways brings you through Notifications, Exercise, Relax (guided breathing), Alarms and Timers. You can scroll vertically on each of these sections to get to more functions. Double tap the top of the screen to go back (or swipe right). That’s it.</p><p>For more customization, like rearranging your favorite workouts in Exercise, you’ll need to go to the Fitbit app on your phone. By default, you’ll find Walk, Run, Bike, Swim, Treadmill and Workout (a catch-all for almost everything else) here. When you’re exercising, the Luxe will show your calories burned, time elapsed, heart rate and, where relevant, pace or miles covered. That’s far less information than you’ll see at a glance on a bigger screen, but that’s the sacrifice you make for a smaller tracker. You can swipe up to see more things, like a pause button, but that’s about it.</p><p>As you’re working out, too, Fitbit will show your cardio zone below your heart rate, with labels like “fat burn” and “peak.” This is useful information, but again, this is so tiny. I have decent eyesight and even I struggled slightly to read it (and it got harder when I was waving my arms about as I ran).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf07c33-e04a-11eb-bbfc-ec1372367285" alt="The Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist against a concrete gray background. The screen shows a run being tracked with a pace of 26:00 and 0.01 miles traveled." data-uuid="136292cc-1ee4-3efc-ae77-d7753aae50e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Cramped screen aside, the Luxe behaves like most other basic Fitbit trackers. Though notifications are tedious to read, it’s nice that you can send a quick pre-set reply or emoji from your wrist. The device will also buzz when you’ve been idle too long, or when you’ve achieved your targeted active minutes. When you lift your wrist, the screen wakes up to show you the time (in thankfully large font). If you wear the band to sleep, it’ll use your heart rate to detect what sleep zones you’re in, and after three nights it’ll tell you things like your resting heart rate. If you’ve been running, walking, swimming or biking (or more) for at least 15 minutes, the Luxe will automatically detect and record your activity. You can change that minimum time requirement to something else via the app, too. Unlike the Charge 4, though, the Luxe doesn’t have onboard GPS and will need to connect to your phone to map your outdoor runs.</p><p>Something that’s new since Google completed its acquisition of Fitbit is the introduction of Fast Pair, which works with Android devices. This made setting the Luxe up and syncing it to my Pixel 4a a <em>breeze</em>. I charged up the Luxe, and a window popped up on all my Pixel review units asking if I wanted to connect to the tracker. I tapped yes and before I knew it, I was going through the welcome pages since I already had the Fitbit app installed. This is much easier than the old method of first opening the app, hitting the Add New Device button and then waiting endlessly for my phone to find the wearable.</p><p>There are some other functions that the Luxe offers, but only if you pay the extra $10 a month for Fitbit Premium. The company is throwing in six months free with every purchase, and that gets you additional insight like your activity, heart rate and sleep trends. It’ll also unlock month-long and year-long reports on your wellness, detailed breakdowns on your sleep and stress, as well as guided workouts, mindfulness and nutrition programs. Without the subscription, most people should find the basic data the Luxe gathers is sufficient. But those who are keen on learning about their long term health trends might benefit from Premium.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca50-e04a-11eb-9ef7-e8ebfc6ad464" alt="Front view of the Fitbit Luxe with a gold mesh bracelet on a patterned blue and white background. Its screen shows a calendar notification for an event from 5:30pm to 7pm." data-uuid="e75ccfa1-86be-3937-89c2-0cac00d26fe0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Fitbit promises the Luxe will last up to five days and I actually went a full week of testing the device before it conked out. That’s with tracking multiple workout sessions every other day, though I didn’t wear the band to sleep most nights. If you keep the Luxe on when you go to bed, and also connect it to your phone’s GPS a lot, your runtime will likely be shorter.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>The most impressive thing about the Fitbit Luxe isn’t its style; it’s its size. The fact that this little device can do so much is noteworthy, and those with smaller wrists will like the way it fits. But its size is also one of its drawbacks — its tiny screen makes things hard to read. Still, for $150, the Luxe is a well-made and capable fitness tracker that can track pretty much everything. If you’re looking for a simple activity band that’s smaller than most, this will serve you well. At least, as long as you have near-perfect vision.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-luxe-review-small-fitness-tracker-150008620.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0e9e970f-69b1-4c31-b6b0-c01053faf536</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 15:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625841800</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T14:43:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca52-e04a-11eb-adde-6922f41702ab" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3bf0ca52-e04a-11eb-adde-6922f41702ab" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Front view of the Fitbit Luxe with a light pink silicone band on a wrist against a dark brown background with some greenery.

The White House <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">just announced</a> that president Joe Biden will be signing a new executive order today that will establish a &quot;whole-of-government effort to promote competition in the American economy.&quot; In other words, it&#39;s targeting anticompetitive practices across a wide range of industries, including internet services and tech.&nbsp;</p><p>The order contains 72 proposals and actions, among which it specifically says &quot;the President encourages the FCC to restore Net Neutrality rules undone by the prior administration.&quot; It also asked the agency to consider limiting early termination fees and prevent internet service providers from making deals with landlords that limit tenant choices. In addition, it urged the FCC to revive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-04-fcc-consumer-broadband-labels.html">the Broadband Nutrition Label that was developed under the Obama administration</a> that would offer greater price transparency.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The order also looked at how &quot;dominant tech firms are undermining competition and reducing innovation,&quot; and announced an administration policy of greater scrutiny of mergers. It would focus on &quot;dominant internet platforms,&quot; especially around &quot;the acquisition of nascent competitors, serial mergers, the accumulation of data, competition by “free” products, and the effect on user privacy.&quot;</p><p>As part of its crackdown on Big Tech, the order called on the Federal Trade Commission to &quot;establish rules on surveillance and the accumulation of data,&quot; along with banning &quot;unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces&quot; and &quot;anticompetitive restrictions on using independent repair shops or doing DIY repairs of your own devices and equipment.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>In other industries, like banking and personal finance, the order similarly asked for more robust scrutiny of mergers. It also urged the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to &quot;issue rules allowing customers to download their banking data and take it with them.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Similar notions of price transparency, consumer rights, increased scrutiny of mergers and prevention of excessive fees were prevalent across the other industries covered. Under agriculture, for example, the order also highlighted the need to give consumers the right to repair their tractors and equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>Proposals for the healthcare sector include allowing for hearing aids to be sold over the counter, supporting price transparency rules, preventing surprise hospital billing and standardizing plan options in the National Health Insurance Marketplace for easier comparison shopping. In the transportation section, airlines were the focus of the suggestions. The order called for rules around greater transparency and disclosure over baggage, change and cancellation fees, as well as better guidelines on when a company must issue refunds over delayed baggage or non-working services (like in-flight WiFi or entertainment).</p><p>After the order is signed later today, the administration will have plenty of work to do to get these initiatives moving. It&#39;s not a guarantee that all the suggestions announced here will eventually happen, but it&#39;s a clear sign that the Biden team is paying attention to the issues of anticompetition, a lack of transparency in multiple industries and other unfair practices.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-executive-order-call-for-reinstating-net-neutrality-141029471.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9e8e7528-48e5-4431-ba8b-f4b76c7b28bf</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 14:10:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625842111</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T14:48:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/70eee530-e0bc-11eb-977f-946b21b63bda" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/70eee530-e0bc-11eb-977f-946b21b63bda" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SAUL LOEB via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden speaks about the situation in Afghanistan from the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, July 8, 2021. - US President Joe Biden expressed confidence on July 8, 2021 in the Afghan military and said that a Taliban takeover of the country is not inevitable.

As cool as they could be, they always feel like an artefact from a dystopia that’s yet to engulf us. When the air burns and the seas boil, you won’t be able to fit a 40-inch HDTV into your existence-support-pod, so these will have to do. It hardly screams “aspirational.”</p><p>It doesn’t help that nobody — not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-09-03-sony-new-hmz-t3-head-mounted-display-wireless-hands-on.html">Sony,</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-01-avegant-glyph-review.html">Avegant</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-21-royole-moon-personal-cinema-headset-impressions.html">Royole</a> nor <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/heroic-failures/the-man-who-invented-vr-goggles-50-years-too-soon">others</a> — has managed to make this concept work. Personal cinemas, then, have replaced VR as the go-to whenever anyone needs to talk about a product that’s perennially on the edge of breaking through, and never has. But, despite them being a solution in search of a problem, and their historical suckiness, things may be about to change.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You see, TCL has been banging against this particular door for years and now, it’s gearing up to launch its first model. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-launch-140021028.html">The Nxtwear G Wearable Display Glasses</a> solve many of the problems that dogged those earlier attempts. They’re not perfect, and you’ll probably not want to buy a pair now, but this is the closest anyone has gotten to making this concept work.</p><div id="a9bcba9e8767476f800a7d785b26a510"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bF_yc0eLSfU?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>TCL’s Nxtwear G puts two tiny displays close to your eyes in order to trick you into thinking you’re looking at a bigger screen. Rather than cram the glasses full of tech, TCL put two displays, a pair of speakers and positioning hardware inside. That keeps the weight down to a very manageable 130 grams (4.5 oz), much kinder to your neck for long-term wear.</p><p>Everything else, including power, is handled by the device you plug this into, and the list of compatible hardware is pretty long. You can use major phones from Samsung, LG and OnePlus, as well as over 30 laptops and more than 25 tablets and 2-in-1s. Essentially, TCL made a plug-and-play external display for your head that should play nice with any compatible DisplayPort-equipped USB-C device.</p><p>The company decided to swim against much of the received wisdom that we’ve seen with other personal cinemas. Rather than trying to enclose the user in a black void, all the better to replicate that tenth-screen-in-a-mall-multiplex feeling, TCL wants you to see the outside world. Even when I tried the prototype, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-07-tcl-personal-cinema-visor-prototype.html?">back in 2019</a>, its representatives said that you should feel comfortable wearing this on public transport, interacting with people as you do.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1cf4ed60-df0b-11eb-befd-db9d0b00af7c" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" data-uuid="61c35401-9493-3109-8a77-52a2bd99c0dd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>With every device I’ve tried them with, you simply need to plug the Nxtwear G in and everything starts. If you’re using a compatible TCL phone, you’ll get a pop-up asking if you want to use mirror mode, or PC mode, which sets you up inside Android’s desktop mode. The phone then acts as a touchpad for you to navigate around with your finger, although if you want to do more than hunt-and-peck, buy a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse.</p><p>Connecting it to my MacBook Pro, too, and the machine recognized it as an external display and I was able to work and watch TV with my primary displays turned off. In fact, I wrote a chunk of this piece while inside this thing, even if I had to turn the zoom up to mad levels to make sure everything was readable.</p><p>The Nxtwear G packs a pair of 16:9, 60Hz micro-OLED 1080p displays that the company says is the equivalent to a 140-inch screen. That requires the usual suspension of ocular disbelief but the effect works here, and the speakers do their job well enough. It’s worth saying that they are essentially blasting audio in every direction, so grab your Bluetooth headphones if, say, your partner gets really annoyed when they can hear you watching <em>Columbo</em> when you’re both in bed.</p><p>I don&#39;t know if you should expect pixel-perfect video quality from a pair of screens this tiny but be advised that they won&#39;t beat your smartphone. Certainly, HD video looks fine, but the smallness of the screens means it&#39;s really tough to see good detail. Colors were washed out, certainly compared to the footage that was playing back on the TCL 20 Pro 5G and MacBook Pro I was connected to during testing.&nbsp;</p><p>TCL’s pitch is to say that, as well as passive viewing, you can also use the glasses to work and it’s here that I think TCL may have some success. As I said, it’s possible to work with these on, and it would make sense to use them if you had to view sensitive documents. When you’re working, say, on a train, this is the perfect antidote to shoulder surfers and other drive-by snoopers. Of course, for whoever makes the inevitable joke about watching adult content with nobody noticing, have a cookie.</p><p>What TCL has managed to do is, several times over, solve the riddle as to why you could ever want to use a personal cinema. There are times and places where you could do so both for work (more or less) and play (in some circumstances). Unfortunately, while the company was making great strides to solve the technical issues, it didn’t have a huge amount of time to devote to making this experience comfortable.</p><p>Your mileage may vary, but I found using these glasses to be a delightful experience right up until the moment it became painful. It is, right now, impossible to use these for a prolonged period of time before something starts hurting, either inside or outside your skull.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0093a0e0-df1e-11eb-ba7c-a3a057e49455" alt="Image from inside" data-uuid="98ca7e5a-01bd-357b-80c5-a04f7c0b5831"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>One of the more problematic design decisions that TCL took was to include a trio of nose pads that push the screen up and higher. The idea is to keep the screens in line with your eyes, but the unfortunate result is that you need to put the nose pads way down your nose. Like, to the point where you feel like, no matter the size, it feels like you’re wearing those wire grips to close your nostrils that professional swimmers wear during sporting events.</p><p>Then there’re the Temple Tips, the part of the glasses arms which bend down to hook over your ears. Whereas with regular glasses those tips are semi-plastic and can be adjusted by an optician (or at home, with a hairdryer and some guile), the Nxtwear G’s arms are rigid. Prolonged periods of wear mean that you’ll get two slices of hard plastic sticking into the soft fleshy bit of your head behind your ears.</p><p>The solution I found to alleviate both of those issues, at least for a bit, was to pull out the nose pads entirely and wear them as I would regular glasses. After all, as a seasoned specs wearer, I accepted that the experience might not be as good — but found that this was actually better. I got a full view of the screen and it was significantly more comfortable to wear for longer periods of time. But, unfortunately, the reason the nose pads stand the glasses off your schnozz is to avoid it getting warm, since the Nxtwear G does generate a decent amount of warmth (not heat, <em>warmth</em>, mind you).</p><p>And then, finally, there’s the issue of eye strain which, no matter how I wore these things, still meant I had to give up for significant rest periods. Maybe, it’s because I’m short-sighted, and so my eyes are already weak and feeble compared to the average personal cinema enjoyer. But I doubt it, and suspect that lots of people may run the risk of an eye-strain headache if they use this for too long at once.</p><p>Now, I bet you’re thinking ‘gee, if these were priced like an accessory, I’d grab a pair just to see what the fuss is about.’ I don’t blame TCL for needing to recoup some of the development costs for these things, but <em>boy</em>. These glasses are going on sale in Oz for $899 AUS, which is the better part of $700 in the US. Heck, you can buy TCL’s new 20 Pro 5G for $500 and just hold it near to your face and pat yourself on the back for your thriftiness.</p><p>Facetiousness aside, I think TCL deserves enormous credit for making what can only be described as the best wearable display ever made. And if you’re able, I’d say you should go and try these out, because my comfort-related dealbreakers may not affect you. And TCL deserves a fair crack at making these things cheaper and a little less prone to pinching, because we’re so damn close. Sincerely, if personal cinemas are going to become a success, it’ll be because it follows the template that TCL has laid down. It just needs a few tweaks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-140057578.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9720e18-ebf4-4cd4-af3c-5446ec231f12</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jul 2021 14:00:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625836988</ingested><modified>2021-07-09T13:23:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/11a0b7d0-df08-11eb-a6ef-6919bf6e3922" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/11a0b7d0-df08-11eb-a6ef-6919bf6e3922" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of TCL's first wearable display.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TCL Nxtwear Glasses]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New York City launches a cyberdefense center in Manhattan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ransomware-jbs-payment-032554207.html">Infrastructure cyberattacks</a> are quickly becoming a significant problem in the US, and New York City is opening a facility that could help fend off those potentially dangerous hacks. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-opens-cyberattack-defense-center-11625778530">reports</a> that NYC has launched a long-in-the-making Cyber Critical Services and Infrastructure (CCSI) operations center in Manhattan to defend against major cyberattacks.</p><p>The initiative&#39;s members are a mix of public and private sector organizations that include Amazon, the Federal Reserve Bank, IBM, the New York Police Department and multiple healthcare providers.

wallet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As studios and streaming services continue to strike deals, jump ship and generally settle with preferred partners, it’s getting harder to figure out which movies will be available where — and when. Amazon’s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-universal-pictures-movies-peacock-183143573.html"> latest deal with Universal</a> is case in point.</p><p>Amazon has struck a multi-year deal for exclusive Prime Video streaming rights for Universal&#39;s live-action theatrical releases, which will kick in next year. According to a report from <em>Deadline</em>, it will cover blockbusters such as J<em>urassic World: Dominion</em>, <em>Get Out</em> director Jordan Peele&#39;s next horror film and <em>Halloween Ends</em>.</p><p>However, the deal is for a chunk of the pay-one window, which is the 18-month period after a movie&#39;s theatrical run. Just days ago, Universal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">struck an agreement with its NBCUniversal sibling, Peacock</a>, for the first four and last four months of the window.</p><p>So, that should mean that within four months of their theatrical release date, Universal&#39;s live-action movies will start streaming on Peacock. Four months after that, they&#39;ll move over to Prime Video for a 10-month run, before going back to Peacock for at least another four months.</p><p>Universal’s plan seems to be shuffling the release schedule around different streaming platforms to ensure its movies get to more audiences across different services — while keeping said platforms satisfied with what they get. The trouble is you might struggle to find the film you want to watch — or miss the chance to see it — unless you’re paying a lot of attention to movie release dates.</p><p></p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html">Qualcomm and ASUS made a phone for Snapdragon Insiders</a></h2><h3>An expensive phone for spec die-hards.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92d23d60-df58-11eb-9d4f-ca1d8406fbcb" style="height:1152;width:2048;" alt="Qualcomm Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders" data-uuid="4b7b5ecc-33c8-32ed-8f98-144818e9d107"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Qualcomm</div></figure></a><p>ASUS and Qualcomm have teamed up to make a smartphone that shows off some of the latter&#39;s mobile tech. Although the phone is ostensibly for the 1.6 million members of the Snapdragon Insiders program, it&#39;ll be more broadly available by August.</p><p>Oddly, it won’t pack the very highest-end Qualcomm mobile processor (Snapdragon 888+), but a Snapdragon 888 5G chipset, with what’s described as &quot;the most comprehensive support for all key 5G sub-6 and mmWave bands&quot; of any device, along with WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E. There’s also 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.</p><p>The screen, too, is specced out: It’s a 6.78-inch AMOLED screen with a 144Hz refresh rate and up to 1,200 nits of brightness. The rear 64-megapixel camera will also be capable of recording 8K video.</p><p>It’ll be one of the first phones to support Snapdragon Sound, which features low Bluetooth latency, listening profiles, active noise cancellation (ANC) and high-resolution audio support up to 24-bit 96kHz. Along with stereo speakers, the phone comes with Master &amp; Dynamic true wireless ANC earbuds, which is a nice touch. The ASUS-designed Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders will initially be available in a few countries, including the US, UK, Japan and South Korea. It will cost a heady $1,499 when it arrives later this summer. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-one-pricing-availability-172610253.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Harley-Davidson&#39;s latest LiveWire electric motorcycle is a more affordable ride</a></h2><h3>The first electric motorcycle from the company&#39;s LiveWire brand is here.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-one-pricing-availability-172610253.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9ea3d380-e00f-11eb-aede-c48e63b59d01" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="LiveWire One" data-uuid="75372d5a-89ef-3c96-a597-f8160d0ff700"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Harley-Davidson</div></figure></a><p>The most eye-catching feature of Harley-Davidson’s new LiveWire One is its price tag. The electric motorcycle will cost $21,999. That’s almost $8,000 less than the $29,799 the original LiveWire sold for when it came out in 2019. With federal subsidies, Harley-Davidson expects most US buyers will be able to get the LiveWire One for less than $20,000.</p><p>Harley-Davidson has also improved the motorcycle’s range. Driving on slower city streets, the LiveWire One can travel 146 miles on a single charge, the company claims. By comparison, its predecessor was limited to a maximum of about 110 city miles. Using a DC fast charger, the company says you can get the LiveWire One’s battery from dead to a full charge in about an hour.</p><p>The second electric motorcycle from Harley-Davidson will initially be limited to customers who live in California, New York and Texas since only 12 dealerships in those states are authorized to sell the LiveWire One at the moment. However, the bike will be available at more dealers come this fall. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/harley-davidson-livewire-one-pricing-availability-172610253.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-033027788.html">Square will build a bitcoin hardware wallet</a></h2><h3>But it&#39;s still early days for the project.</h3><h3></h3><p>Square is building a bitcoin hardware wallet and service, a month after company CEO Jack Dorsey announced it&#39;s considering the move.

In its decision, the board questioned Facebook’s internal policies and said the company should be more transparent about whether other key policies may have been “lost.”</p><p>The underlying case stems from an Instagram post about Abdullah Öcalan, in which the poster “encouraged readers to engage in conversation about Öcalan’s imprisonment and the inhumane nature of solitary confinement.” (As the board notes, Öcalan is a founding member of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, which Facebook has officially designated as a “dangerous organization.”)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook had initially removed the post, as Facebook users are barred from praising or showing support for dangerous organizations or individuals. However, Facebook also had “internal guidance” — created partially as a result of discussions around Öcalan’s imprisonment — that “allows discussion on the conditions of confinement for individuals designated as dangerous.” But that rule was not applied, even after the user’s initial appeal. Facebook told the board it had  “inadvertently not transferred” that part of its policy when it moved to a new review system in 2018.</p><p>Though Facebook had already admitted the error and reinstated the post, the board said it was “concerned” with how the case had been handled, and that “an important policy exception” had effectively fallen through the cracks for three years.</p><p>“The Board is concerned that Facebook lost specific guidance on an important policy exception for three years,” the group wrote. “Facebook’s policy of defaulting towards removing content showing ‘support’ for designated individuals, while keeping key exceptions hidden from the public, allowed this mistake to go unnoticed for an extended period. Facebook only learned that this policy was not being applied because of the user who decided to appeal the company’s decision to the Board.”</p><p>The board also chastised Facebook for not being transparent about how many other users may have been affected by the same issue. Facebook told the board it wasn’t “technically feasible” to determine how many other posts may have been mistakenly taken down. “Facebook’s actions in this case indicate that the company is failing to respect the right to remedy, contravening its Corporate Human Rights Policy,” the board said.</p><p>The case highlights how Facebook’s complex rules are often shaped by guidance that users can’t see, and how the Oversight Board has repeatedly challenged the company to make all its policies more clear to users.</p><p>Though it’s only taken up a handful of cases so far, the Oversight Board has repeatedly criticized Facebook for not following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-trump-influence-203741183.html"><ins>its own rules</ins></a>. “They can&#39;t just invent new unwritten rules when it suits them,” board co-chair Helle Thorning-Schmidt told reporters after they said Facebook was wrong to impose an “indefinite” suspension on Donald Trump. The board has also criticized Facebook for not alerting users to key parts of its policies, such as its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-satire-exception-community-standards-oversight-board-212257406.html"><ins>“satire exception.”</ins></a> It’s pushed the company to clarify its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-hate-speech-194501894.html"><ins>hate speech</ins></a> policies, and how it treats speech <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html"><ins>from politicians</ins></a> and other high-profile figures.</p><p>Facebook has 30 days to respond to the Oversight Board in this case, including several recommendations that it further clarify its “Dangerous Individuals and Organizations” policy and update its transparency reporting process.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-lost-rule-193222133.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5a236e6-3cfe-44a3-8d4f-a802a97e2127</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 19:32:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625772773</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T19:33:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/4e4406f0-616e-11eb-bedf-b2adf9310de2" width="5558" height="3754" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/4e4406f0-616e-11eb-bedf-b2adf9310de2" width="5558" height="3754" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 07: Facebook logo is seen on a smartphone as Oversight Board at the background in Ankara, Turkey on May 07, 2020.

As <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/amazon-prime-video-imdb-tv-universal-licensing-deal-1234788103/"><em>Deadline</em></a> reports, it&#39;s the first time Amazon has made such an agreement with a major US studio. The deal kicks in with Universal&#39;s 2022 slate of movies.</p><p>Here&#39;s where things might get a little confusing. The deal is for a chunk of the pay-one window, which is the 18-month period after a movie&#39;s theatrical run. Earlier this week, Universal and its NBCUniversal sibling <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/peacock">Peacock</a> reached <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">a similar agreement</a> for the first four and last four months of the window.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Within four months of their theatrical release date, Universal&#39;s live-action movies will start streaming on Peacock. Four months after that, they&#39;ll move over to Prime Video for 10 months, then the films will go back to Peacock for at least another four months. Streaming rights can get pretty complicated!</p><p>The deal covers blockbusters such as <em>Jurassic World: Dominion</em>, <em>Get Out </em>director Jordan Peele&#39;s next horror film and <em>Halloween Ends</em>. Movies from Focus Features and Blumhouse are also part of the pact.</p><p>Netflix currently streams Universal&#39;s animated movies from Illumination and DreamWorks. According to <em>Deadline, </em>from next year onwards, Netflix might still stream the studio&#39;s animated releases for the 10 months of the pay-one window that they&#39;re not on Peacock. In any case, those films will hit Prime Video at a later date. Phew.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amazon&#39;s free streaming service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/imdb%20tv">IMDb TV</a> will hold exclusive streaming rights for 2020 and 2021 theatrical movies from Universal. The deal covers <em>The Invisible Man </em>and current box office champ <em>F9, </em>along with some older animated movies like <em>Despicable Me 2, How to Train Your Dragon 2</em> and <em>Shrek 2</em>.</p><p>The Prime Video deal follows a major agreement <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-netflix-exclusive-deal-182221930.html">between Netflix and Sony Pictures</a>. Starting in 2022, Netflix will have exclusive rights to Sony&#39;s theatrical releases for the 18-month pay-one window. So, movies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-movie-delayed-again-again-024721336.html"><em>Uncharted</em></a>, the <em>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</em> sequel and <em>Morbius </em>are all Netflix-bound.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-universal-pictures-movies-peacock-183143573.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1b8c4a75-370a-4272-a566-bf9a0133e977</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 08 Jul 2021 18:31:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625769679</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T18:41:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1ae5700-e019-11eb-bff7-4a22abbccc9a" width="4039" height="2692" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1ae5700-e019-11eb-bff7-4a22abbccc9a" width="4039" height="2692" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LISA O'CONNOR via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Universal Studios globe fountain is pictured as season pass holders attend to the opening day in Los Angeles, California, on April 15, 2021. - Universal Studios Hollywood will reopen on April 16 following more than a year of closures due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

He went on to mention the company’s engineers believe they’re approaching a “practical limit” with existing ICE technology. “They know we know that electric motors can give us more,” he said. “And if we know of a technology that can give our customers an advantage, we have an obligation to embrace it.”</p><p>As for the car itself, we didn’t get to see much of it, but the concept Dodge showed off looks to borrow design cues from the company’s iconic 1969 Charger.
