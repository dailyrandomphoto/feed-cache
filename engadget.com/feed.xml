According to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-built-biometric-system-sparks-concerns-afghans-rcna1829"><em>NBC News</em></a>, privacy advocates are <a href="https://www.accessnow.org/cms/assets/uploads/2021/08/Civil_Society_Afghanistan_Biometrics_Letter.pdf">worried</a> [PDF] about the possibility of the Taliban using the database to identify and target individuals who worked with the US-backed Afghan government and organizations that champion women&#39;s rights. The system&#39;s database, which the US shared with the Afghan government, reportedly contains millions of fingerprints, iris scans and face photos collected throughout the years.</p><p>While the exact number of individuals in the database is unclear, an Air Force medic the publication talked to said he was instructed to scan the irises, take the fingerprints and photograph the face of every Afghan who came through the hospital doors while he was in service. Other military officers had to the same thing. The goal was to have an extensive database of fingerprints that authorities can search in the event a bomb is found.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, since the US military scanned anyone and everyone, one of the vets who helped collect Afghans&#39; biometrics said it could be difficult to use the database to find specific individuals to target. Someone being in the database doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they worked with the US government or women&#39;s rights organizations. Department of Defense spokesperson Eric Pahon also denied that Afghans&#39; biometric data is at risk. He told <em>NBC News</em> that &quot;The U.S. has taken prudent actions to ensure that sensitive data does not fall into the Taliban&#39;s hands. This data is not at risk of misuse,&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/privacy-advocates-concerns-us-built-biometric-system-afghans-045950737.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">81ee4b3d-c459-4347-a5af-21e56ffdebd3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 04:59:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630472416</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T05:00:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7a63be10-0add-11ec-977d-a653ea515d14" width="6772" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7a63be10-0add-11ec-977d-a653ea515d14" width="6772" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Peach_iStock via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Businessman using fingerprint scan.

CEO Sundar Pichai <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/extending-our-voluntary-return-office/">told employees</a> the company is delaying the mandatory return to office until January 2022. The current voluntary scheme will last through January 10th. From then on, Google&#39;s offices will make the decisions about when (and if) to make office work mandatory. Staff will be notified 30 days in advance if they&#39;re required to show up.</p><p>The internet pioneer previously hoped to institute a hybrid work week on October 18th, with staff coming in for three out of five days. That, in turn, was later than the originally planned September return.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The reasoning behind the delay isn&#39;t surprising. The COVID-19 pandemic recovery, and thus the return to offices, has been &quot;longer and bumpier than expected,&quot; according to Pichai. In other words, factors like the virus&#39; Delta variant, vaccination rates and varying case levels have clouded the situation — what works well in one country could be dangerous in another.</p><p>Not that Google will take chances regardless. The company now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-vaccine-mandate-181042975.html">requires full vaccination</a> for any employee returning to the office, voluntary or otherwise. Google might be eager to have people fill its halls, but it also doesn&#39;t want safety issues or skittish employees. It&#39;s not alone, either — fellow tech firms <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-return-to-office-092520216.html">like Apple</a> have delayed their own return-to-office plans as the pandemic&#39;s realities become clearer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-extends-voluntary-return-to-office-plan-204850097.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4427ca64-d7c7-4f99-ab05-9ff6adf09ce0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 20:48:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630440959</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T20:16:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/0e7b3510-16a2-11ea-bbfe-5fc9911d4886" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/0e7b3510-16a2-11ea-bbfe-5fc9911d4886" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JHVEPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mountain View, California, USA - March 28, 2018: Google sign at Google's headquarters in Silicon Valley.

Samsung is <a href="https://www.samsungmobilepress.com/featurestories/samsungs-one-ui-3.1.1-bring-next-level-foldable-experiences-to-galaxy-z-series-users">rolling out</a> a One UI 3.1.1 update that brings many of those phones&#39; multitasking and app resizing features to the original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-samsung-galaxy-fold-review-expensive-experiment.html">Fold</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">Fold 2</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review.html">Flip</a> and Flip 5G.</p><p>The Fold line unsurprisingly benefits the most thanks to its larger, tablet-like screen. Features like Multi-Active Window (up to three apps at once) and App Split View (seeing extra content for an app) make that folding display much more useful. You can also force apps to resize and rotate on your Fold, pin your favorites with the Taskbar and mirror your internal display on the cover screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not that Flip owners are out of luck. Drag &amp; Split lets all Samsung foldable owners create a new window for an already-open app, and you can invoke Flex Mode to bring up media controls when the phone is partially folded.</p><p>Most of these features are deploying now, although you&#39;ll have to wait an extra week if you&#39;re using the first Galaxy Fold. Not that you&#39;ll likely mind. This could significantly improve the usefulness of your older foldable, and suggests Samsung is eager to earn the loyalty of early adopters — if just to increase the chances that you&#39;ll buy another Fold or Flip when you&#39;re due for an upgrade.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-one-ui-3-1-1-galaxy-z-fold-2-185330625.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52a096ef-ddf6-4c82-bef9-c9372c55478d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 18:53:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630435496</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T18:45:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e25a91f0-0a84-11ec-afb3-566a88fd9044" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e25a91f0-0a84-11ec-afb3-566a88fd9044" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung One UI 3.1.1 for Galaxy Z Fold 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung One UI 3.1.1 for Galaxy Z Fold 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Punishing platformer 'Ghostrunner' adds accessibility mode]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://t.co/gSKwtcUxZu?amp=1"><em>Ghostrunner</em></a> was one of the best surprises of 2020.

It’s also a challenging game that demands precision and purpose from the player. Make a single mistake, and you’ll need to replay a section of a level again.

Make it all the way to the end, and you’ll earn a fancy new katana for your character.</p><p>Both Assist and Wave modes are available today for free on the platforms where you can already buy <em>Ghostrunner</em>. That includes PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC via Steam, the Epic Games Store and GOG.

Nearly all forms of electric transportation have done well during the pandemic, but e-bikes, in particular, have had a moment. Last summer, sales of <a href="https://www.npd.com/news/press-releases/2020/plot-twist-u-s-performance-bike-sales-rise-in-june-reports-the-npd-group/">powered bicycles</a> outpaced all others by a significant margin. In most cases, you’re probably best off visiting your local bike shop to see what they have on offer, but with how difficult it&#39;s been to buy a new bicycle during the pandemic, it never hurts to have another place to shop for your next ride.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-buy-starts-selling-e-bikes-electric-scooters-171330423.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99f044df-60e2-4ce7-8f92-134de84a2d13</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 17:13:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630430681</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T17:24:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/00fa0da0-0a7d-11ec-95ff-f24748b71d4c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/00fa0da0-0a7d-11ec-95ff-f24748b71d4c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Best Buy]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Best Buy]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Best Buy e-bike]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon may jump into live audio with a focus on music]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon may be the next to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-launches-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-110028076.html">hop on the live audio bandwagon</a>, although its take might not be what you&#39;d expect. <em>Axios</em><a href="https://www.axios.com/amazon-live-audio-clubhouse-competitor-ea0ead59-f6d3-49a0-a216-a4105e0338ba.html">sources</a> claim Amazon is developing a live audio offering that would focus on music, including concerts and other events — more like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-clubhouse-competitor-live-audio-chat-locker-room-music-sports-culture-135957628.html">Spotify</a> than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-clubhouse-app-130015640.html">Clubhouse</a>.

Amazon recently integrated Twitch streams into the Music app, and the firm&#39;s acquisition of podcast subscription business Wondery in 2020 signalled an intent to dive further into audio. There&#39;s also the simple matter of competition. Spotify, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-ticketed-spaces-launching-224353538.html">Twitter Spaces</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-launches-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-110028076.html">Facebook&#39;s audio rooms</a> could all pose a threat, even if Clubhouse doesn&#39;t.

The move, which was first reported by <a href="https://www.axios.com/facebook-news-feeds-politics-b4a32c93-3dab-42cd-b761-039363ebdb7c.html"><em>Axios</em></a>, follows tests in the US, Canada, Brazil and Indonesia earlier this year, where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reducing-political-content-test-145126460.html"><ins>Facebook limited political content</ins></a>. The company plans to expand the tests to Costa Rica, Sweden, Spain and Ireland.</p><p>&quot;These changes are in response to common feedback from our community,&quot; a Facebook spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;We conduct ongoing research with people to hear what parts of Facebook are working well for them, and to gather feedback about what we could be doing better. One of the themes we’ve heard is that some people feel that there’s too much political content in their News Feeds. We hope these changes address this feedback and preserve the ability for people to find and interact with political content on Facebook, while respecting their appetite for it at the top of their News Feed.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook says some engagement signals are better than others at indicating which posts people deem interesting or valuable. As a result, the company is expanding some tests related to engagement signals. The tests put less importance on how likely a user is to share or comment on political content. &quot;At the same time, we’re putting more emphasis on new signals such as how likely people are to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-news-feed-surveys-negative-experiences-181349913.html">provide us with negative feedback</a> on posts about political topics and current events when we rank those types of posts in their News Feed,&quot; Facebook wrote in an <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/">updated blog post</a>.</p><p>The changes could reduce the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-2020-avaaz-report-221609324.html"><ins>level of misinformation</ins></a> on Facebook, if the algorithms are able to effectively detect and de-emphasize all political content. Political campaigns might have to rethink their strategies of how to reach voters too. On the flip side, the move could come as a blow to news organizations, especially those focused on politics, given the volume of traffic Facebook can drive to websites.</p><p>The switch could also make Facebook a less hostile place for users. Political discussions can quickly get heated, which might put off those who use the service largely for keeping in touch with their loved ones and sharing pictures of their kids. For what it&#39;s worth, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-explains-what-people-see-news-feed-crowdtangle-015627086.html"><ins>claimed in November</ins></a> political content makes up just six percent of what users see.</p><p>&quot;We’ve learned that these changes will affect public affairs content more broadly and that publishers may see an impact on their traffic,&quot; Facebook said. &quot;Knowing this, we are planning a gradual and methodical rollout for these tests, but remain encouraged, and expect to announce further expansions in the coming months.&quot;</p><p>The reported changes follow other moves that Facebook has made to make political content less visible. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-groups-policy-2021-161815048.html"><ins>stopped</ins></a> recommending civic and political groups to users earlier this year after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-groups-social-issues-recommendations-election-175158432.html"><ins>temporarily pausing</ins></a> those recommendations ahead of the 2020 US election.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-content-down-rank-news-feed-162401398.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af62282b-08f4-4552-9b59-8c32e9015ae7</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 16:24:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630426810</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T16:20:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-06/db0cb370-a701-11ea-bf7e-89ef5ff9a2e3" width="5388" height="3426" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-06/db0cb370-a701-11ea-bf7e-89ef5ff9a2e3" width="5388" height="3426" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[wellesenterprises via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Menlo Park, CA, USA – March 18, 2014: A sign at the entrance to the Facebook World Headquarters located in Menlo Park.

The publisher calls this a gameplay reveal, but it&#39;s mostly a showcase of what developer Visual Concepts managed to do with the new hardware from Sony and Microsoft. Thankfully, the studio also <a href="https://nba.2k.com/courtside-report/nba-2k22-gameplay">published a new Courtside Report</a> that details some of the gameplay enhancements players can look forward to when they pick the game up next month.</p><div id="16ecc16a2ada47eab90adb00688fe6c3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OcUzwnA569M?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>To start, Visual Concepts says it completely rebuilt the shot contest and blocking systems, as well as made a significant update to how the game handles defensive rotations. When it comes to moving a player up the court, the studio promises tighter controls that will allow you to put together new combos in creative ways.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But some of the most significant changes look like they’re coming to how the game handles shooting. <em>NBA 2K22</em> will feature a new shot meter that will dynamically change depending on the abilities of the player you’re controlling and whether their shot is contested. According to Visual Concepts, <em>NBA 2K22</em> will put a greater emphasis on Shot IQ. You’ll be more successful if you take the time to find an open teammate and take a smart shot. For players who like to drive to the basket, there’s a new dunk style creator that will allow you to customize their dunk repertoire.</p><p>Outside of those improvements, fans of women&#39;s basketball can look forward to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nba-2k22-wnba-mode-details-150025247.html">much-improved WNBA mode</a>. All told, it looks like NBA 2K&#39;s second PS5 and Xbox Series X outing should be a good one.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nba-2k22-gameplay-trailer-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-161855428.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a157525b-9540-490e-a8fd-9a045d418123</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 16:18:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630426590</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T16:16:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Basketball]]></category><category><![CDATA[National Basketball Association]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2ac72b70-0a75-11ec-bfbf-611f235e1732" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2ac72b70-0a75-11ec-bfbf-611f235e1732" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Visual Concepts / 2K]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NBA 2K22]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NBA 2K22]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chrome beta's experimental cards help you resume recent tasks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google might just save you from hitting your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-18-chrome-may-fight-back-button-hijacks.html">browser&#39;s &quot;back&quot; button</a> (or sifting through your history) more than you&#39;d like.

You&#39;ll have to switch this on by enabling the #ntp-modules flag, but it could be helpful if you&#39;d rather not backtrack through your page visits just to pick up where you left off.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2f9f95e0-0a72-11ec-8fff-bbe569dcfd7e" style="height:1161;width:1920;" alt="Google Chrome beta recent task cards" data-uuid="71c65e61-bd0e-3e36-80ba-fdba462b49fa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Another addition will help you avoid a back-and-forth when digging through your search results. An experimental feature adds a row below Chrome&#39;s address bar on Android to display the rest of your search results. If one link wasn&#39;t what you were looking for, you won&#39;t have to tap &quot;back&quot; to check out the rest. You can try the row by enabling the #continuous-search flag.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Android beta will help you share pithy sayings, too. Enable the #webnotes-stylize flag and Chrome will create stylized images from quotes. You just have to share highlighted text and tap &quot;create card&quot; to choose a template.</p><p>It&#39;s not certain if or when these features will be active by default in Chrome. Don&#39;t be surprised if Google changes or even cuts them based on feedback. With that said, they appear to be helpful enough that it might just be a matter of time before they reach more users.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/chrome-beta-task-cards-search-row-160050399.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6498316d-27cf-4547-9c08-f21ced8ee33f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 16:00:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630424720</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T15:45:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/34fd3200-df39-11ea-bebd-7da8c36682d5" width="5798" height="4139" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/34fd3200-df39-11ea-bebd-7da8c36682d5" width="5798" height="4139" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - FEBRUARY 18: The logo of Google Chrome is seen on laptop's screen in Ankara, Turkey on February 18, 2020.

Starting today, anyone — not just those with a <a href="https://www.strava.com/subscribe">subscription</a> — can use the app’s <a href="https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/224357527-Strava-Beacon">Beacon feature</a> to share their location with friends and family members.</p><p>To enable the feature, tap the “You” tab at the bottom of the main interface and then the cog icon that appears near the top right corner. Once you’re in the settings menu, scroll down until you see the relevant section and toggle the feature on. With Beacon, you can share your location with up to three people. When you add a list of safety contacts to the app, Strava will automatically notify those individuals when you start recording an activity. Another option is to manually text a Beacon link to a friend or family if you don’t want to flood them with notifications each time you go out for a spin.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As a free user, you won’t be able to use the Beacon functionality through a connected device like a Wahoo bike computer or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-15-strava-apple-health-sync.html"><ins>Apple Watch</ins></a>. Strava says that’s something that you will still need a subscription to access “due to the added complexity of supporting those integrations.” One other thing to keep in mind is the software will only share your location as long as you’re recording an activity. Either way, making a safety tool like Beacon free in most contexts is a good move for Strava, particularly after the company moved some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/strava-is-moving-some-free-features-behind-a-subscription-120156844.html"><ins>previously free features</ins></a> behind a subscription.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/strava-beacon-feature-available-free-users-160045955.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">765eb224-dc72-48ad-9704-921b6e45ba06</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 16:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630339081</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T15:58:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d720d960-09a9-11ec-9aef-0ae8602bdafc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d720d960-09a9-11ec-9aef-0ae8602bdafc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Strava]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Strava Beacon safety feature]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Strava Beacon safety feature]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Calendar can show how much of your time is taken up by meetings]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have had meetings that simply could have been an email. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google%20calendar"><ins>Google Calendar</ins></a> will soon provide insights on how you spend your work day, including how long you spend in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/meetings"><ins>meetings</ins></a>, so you can find out just how much time you could be saving if your bosses sent memos instead.</p><p>This idea behind <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/better-understand-how-youre-spending.html">Time Insights</a> is for you to gain a better understanding of how your time is taken up, so perhaps you can make adjustments if you&#39;re spending too much time in Zoom calls or conference rooms. For instance, maybe you can consolidate meetings if you spend many of them with the same people.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The feature can highlight the days and times where you tend to be in meetings the most.

The company has <a href="https://motional.com/news/motional-and-hyundai-motor-group-unveil-the-ioniq-5-robotaxi-motional-s-next-generation-robotaxi">revealed</a> that its first commercial robotaxi will be based on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-300-mile-ioniq-5-crossover-ev-makes-its-official-north-american-debut-190054008.html">Ioniq 5</a>, adding self-driving hardware (cameras, LiDAR and radar) to the brand new EV. It&#39;ll also include in-cabin interfaces to give passengers some options during their ride, such as asking for an extra stop.</p><p>The crossover includes &quot;safety redundancies&quot; to keep critical systems running.

Microsoft has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/08/31/windows-11-available-on-october-5/">announced</a> that Windows 11 will be available on October 5th, both as a free upgrade for qualifying Windows 10 systems as well as new PCs shipping with the OS pre-installed.</p><p>Don&#39;t assume you&#39;ll get the upgrade on day one, though. This is a gradual rollout that will prioritize newer hardware and use &quot;intelligence models&quot; to determine who gets the upgrade first, including reliability and device age. All supporting machines will get the update by mid-2022, but this suggests you may be toward the back of the queue if you&#39;re using relatively old hardware. At least some shipping Windows 10 PCs will be on the fast track for Windows 11 updates, including models from Acer, ASUS, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung and (of course) Microsoft.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Notably, though, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-154014628.html">Android app support</a> won&#39;t be available on launch. Microsoft now only expects to introduce the feature in a Windows Insider preview build sometime in the &quot;coming months.&quot; That&#39;s not completely shocking given the challenges of translating mobile apps to a mouse-and-keyboard experience, but this still means one of Windows 11&#39;s tentpole features won&#39;t be available for a long while.</p><p>The new platform centers on a refreshed interface with a new Start interface, Snap Layouts, widgets and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-microsoft-teams-integrated-153343398.html">Teams integration</a>. You&#39;ll also find a redesigned Microsoft Store that even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-wants-steam-epic-in-windows-11-app-store-132411163.html">lets third-party stores operate</a> within its walls. Technology like DirectX 12, DirectStorage and Auto HDR also promise to help gamers.</p><p>This might not be Microsoft&#39;s smoothest launch, however. On top of the delayed Android feature, Microsoft sparked some confusion with relatively steep hardware requirements that have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-supported-processors-update-175544403.html">evolved over time</a> and include demands for security features like TPM 2.0. Microsoft will technically let you install Windows 11 on unsupported hardware, but you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-updates-withheld-older-cpus-194632054.html">might be denied updates</a> unless you&#39;re willing to install new OS images on a frequent basis. Unlike Windows 10, then, you can&#39;t just assume your years-old computer will run this software without a hitch — there&#39;s a chance you&#39;ll have to upgrade your hardware first, even if it&#39;s still fast enough for your needs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-release-date-132605467.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2a8e7ca4-5858-45d1-8f55-35c48bfc509e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 13:26:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630417747</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T13:49:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/84855690-0a5d-11ec-af6b-3e6091b7d687" width="2000" height="1261" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/84855690-0a5d-11ec-af6b-3e6091b7d687" width="2000" height="1261" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 11 on a Microsoft Surface Laptop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 11 on a Microsoft Surface Laptop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones have improved ANC and a familiar design]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bose introduced its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-21-bose-qc35-headphones-google-assistant.html">QuietComfort 35 II</a> headphones back in 2017, and despite debuting the stellar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-16-bose-700-headphones-review.html">Bose 700</a> model in 2019, the company was adamant its QC line <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-qc35-ii-gaming-headset-150520136.html">wasn&#39;t going away</a>. Now the QC35 II has a proper replacement: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:the QuietComfort 45" href="https://fave.co/3zzcUum">the QuietComfort 45</a>. Bose says these headphones &quot;maintain the hallmarks of their predecessor&quot; when it comes to audio quality, comfort, reliable controls and more. As you can see, the QC45 also keeps nearly the same design at the QC35 and QC35 II except for a few subtle changes. And at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$329.95" href="https://amzn.to/3BpBE95">$329.95</a>, they&#39;ll debut at a lower price than the previous two QuietComfort models.&nbsp;</p><p>While the company went with an updated look for the Bose 700, it largely maintained the aesthetic of the QuietComfort line for the QC45. Bose says it kept the design elements that made the QC35 and QC35 II &quot;an identifiable classic,&quot; but it got rid of the pleats on the earpads and closed some gaps to create &quot;smooth transitions.&quot; You should still expect these to be light and cozy as none of the changes should impact the QuietComfort&#39;s highly-regarded status as a travel companion. The QC45 still folds flat for ear storage, thanks to the return of rotating earcups and a hinged headband.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fdf58bd0-09ae-11ec-b995-20f55d0946b9" alt="Bose QuietComfort 45 headphones" data-uuid="7ff30a53-b068-399b-87cd-60ce49ab9e15"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bose</div></figure><p>On the inside is where the most notable changes lie. Bose says it improved the noise cancellation with the combination of internal and external microphones paired with a &quot;proprietary digital chip.&quot; The company explains that this setup can detect and silence more mid-range frequencies — things like the roar of train, office or coffee shop — when you activate Quiet mode. The QuietComfort 45 also has an Aware setting that offers full transparency to your environment. Unlike other Bose models, there&#39;s no level adjustment for the active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you just get the two aforementioned modes separately.&nbsp;</p><p>Those two audio settings are accessible via the QC45&#39;s on-board controls. There&#39;s a dedicated button for them on the left earcup that can also mute the mic during a call. All of the core functions — volume, play/pause, voice assistant, power and pairing — are on the right side. Like the previous models, they&#39;re all physical buttons instead of touch controls, so they should preform reliably.&nbsp;</p><p>Bose also extended the battery life with the QuietComfort 45. The company says you can expect up to 24 hours of listening time on a charge. That&#39;s up from 20 hours on the QC35 II. A quick-charge feature will give you three hours of listening time in 15 minutes and the QC45 charges via a USB-C cable.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:QuietComfort 45 headphones" href="https://fave.co/3zzcUum">QuietComfort 45 headphones</a> will be available in black and light grey color options on September 23rd for $329.95.

Following the introduction of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-18-jabra-elite-65t-true-wireless-earbuds-review.html">Elite 65t</a> in 2018, the company has been keen on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">updating its lineup</a> every year or so. Today, it introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html">three models</a>, including a new flagship noise-cancelling option with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:the Elite 7 Pro" href="https://fave.co/2YdOqJx">the Elite 7 Pro</a>. The successor to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85t-review-130035415.html">the comfy and capable 85t</a>, this version has a revamped design and smaller size, but all the best parts of previous Jabra earbuds remain. Perhaps most notably, the company is making big promises for improving calls with its new MultiSensor Voice tech.&nbsp;</p><p>The main point Jabra is driving home with the Elite 7 Pro is its &quot;ultimate call clarity.&quot; Almost every headphone company makes bold claims about voice performance and they very rarely pan out. You almost always end up sounding like you&#39;re on speaker phone. With this new model, Jabra says its MultiSensor Voice setup combines a bone conduction sensor that picks up the vibrations of your jaw with a set of four microphones and the company&#39;s &quot;intelligent algorithms.&quot; Jabra explains that the bone conduction sensor, or voice pick-up unit (VPU), kicks in when those algorithms detect certain types of noise from the mics — like wind, for example. The company&#39;s on-board tech then combines voice data from the sensor and the microphones &quot;to transmit the best call quality.&quot; Again, all of this is something we&#39;ll need to put to the test to properly judge its merits, but it&#39;s clear Jabra is trying to improve call audio as many of us continue to work remotely.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b57e59d0-0a54-11ec-af9f-721ec170e9a1" alt="Jabra Elite 7" data-uuid="61129138-48f8-3d69-9f27-38a092678518"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jabra</div></figure><p>Jabra says the Elite 7 Pro is 16 percent smaller than its Elite 75t which was the company&#39;s most compact option thus far. Smaller earbuds typically lead to a more comfortable fit and since Jabra can lean on parent company GN&#39;s hearing aid expertise and library of over 62,000 ear scans, it has some insight on shape as well. The outside controls panel now outlines the entire earbud instead of being a perfect circle with a small elbow that extended out to hold the microphones. Jabra also redesigned the charging case, opting for a flatter pill-shaped aesthetic this time around.&nbsp;</p><p>Through its Sound+ app, Jabra gives you lots of options for customization. Similar to previous models, active noise cancellation (ANC) is adjustable on the Elite 7 Pro, so you can dial in the level of distraction blocking you need. Jabra once again offers the ability to reconfigure the on-board buttons with its MyControls feature. The options here include volume, play/pause, skipping tracks, noise cancellation mode, access to a voice assistant and more. The company also provides a fit test (MyFit) to determine if you&#39;ve selected the correct ear tips for a proper seal. Should you need to adjust the overall audio profile, MySound can help with EQ tweaks.</p><p>Jabra says the Elite 7 Pro will last up to nine hours with ANC enabled. Turn it off and you can expect an additional two hours of use. The case holds just under three full charges, offering up to 35 total hours between it and the buds with noise cancellation on, or up to 42 total hours with ANC off. Dock the Elite 7 Pro for five minutes and you&#39;ll get just over an hour of listening time. Jabra also says this model can hit 50 percent battery levels with a half-hour charge. And for convenience, the Elite 7 Pro supports wireless charging for all the times you&#39;d rather just set down the case than mess with a USB-C cable.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34661340-0aa1-11ec-befd-84088b6689bc" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="Jabra Elite 7 Active" data-uuid="95d9ea50-790a-3697-a057-02269f1b6420"><figcaption>Jabra Elite 7 Active</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jabra</div></figure><p>Similar to previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-jabra-elite-active-75t-hands-on.html">sporty versions</a> of true wireless models, Jabra is doing that once again with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Elite 7 Active" href="https://fave.co/3BuOWBk">Elite 7 Active</a>. These earbuds have a similar design to the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Elite 7 Pro" href="https://fave.co/2YdOqJx">Elite 7 Pro</a> and nearly all of the same features. ANC, HearThrough transparency mode, nine-hour battery life, wireless charging and IP57 waterproof rating are all here. The key differences are the Elite 7 Active doesn&#39;t have the Pro&#39;s MultiSensor Voice tech, but the sport model is made with a new material Jabra is calling ShakeGrip — a liquid silicone rubber that should help with the overall fit when you get sweaty.&nbsp;</p><p>The Elite 7 Pro and Elite 7 Active will be available on October 1st for $200 and $180 respectively. The Elite 7 Pro comes in black, silver/black and gold/beige color options while the Elite 7 Active has black, navy and mint green versions. At $200, the the Elite 7 Pro is $30 cheaper than the Elite 85t when it debuted.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to these models, Jabra also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html">announced the $79 Elite 3 today</a>. This affordable option doesn&#39;t have ANC or wireless charging, but it does offer a lot of features that make the company&#39;s earbuds worth considering. Those include seven-hour battery life, HearThrough transparency mode and both customizable EQ and on-board controls.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">54f55be6-4e97-4fac-a17f-8dc9eee13b70</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 13:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630444851</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T21:20:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7f7d1a40-09f7-11ec-bea2-161f0afb3cfe" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7f7d1a40-09f7-11ec-bea2-161f0afb3cfe" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jabra]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 7 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 7 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NVIDIA's latest tech makes AI voices more expressive and realistic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The voices on Amazon&#39;s Alexa, Google Assistant and other AI assistants are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-09-in-pursuit-of-the-perfect-ai-voice.html">far ahead</a> of old-school GPS devices, but they still lack the rhythms, intonation and other qualities that make speech sound, well, human. NVIDIA has unveiled new research and tools that can capture those natural speech qualities by letting you train the AI system with your own voice, the company announced at the <a href="https://www.interspeech2021.org/">Interspeech 2021</a> conference.&nbsp;</p><p>To improve its AI voice synthesis, NVIDIA’s text-to-speech research team developed a model called RAD-TTS, a winning entry at an NAB broadcast convention competition to develop the most realistic avatar. The system allows an individual to train a text-to-speech model with their own voice, including the pacing, tonality, timbre and more.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b719eee04b2348aa8e61d766e25777dc"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RknIx6XmffA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Another RAD-TTS feature is voice conversion, which lets a user deliver one speaker&#39;s words using another person&#39;s voice. That interface gives fine, frame-level control over a synthesized voice’s pitch, duration and energy.&nbsp;</p><p>Using this technology, NVIDIA&#39;s researchers created more conversational-sounding voice narration for its own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHnYvH1qtObE_PjzaAFqS_CpmumGx5cW">I Am AI video series</a> using synthesized rather than human voices. The aim was to get the narration to match the tone and style of the videos, something that hasn&#39;t been done well in many AI narrated videos to date. The results are still a bit robotic, but better than any AI narration I&#39;ve ever heard.</p><p>&quot;With this interface, our video producer could record himself reading the video script, and then use the AI model to convert his speech into the female narrator’s voice. Using this baseline narration, the producer could then direct the AI like a voice actor — tweaking the synthesized speech to emphasize specific words, and modifying the pacing of the narration to better express the video’s tone,&quot; NVIDIA wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>NVIDIA is distributing some of this research — optimized to run efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs, of course — to anyone who wants to try it via open source through the NVIDIA NeMo Python toolkit for GPU-accelerated conversational AI, available on the company&#39;s NGC hub of containers and other software.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Several of the models are trained with tens of thousands of hours of audio data on NVIDIA DGX systems. Developers can fine tune any model for their use cases, speeding up training using mixed-precision computing on NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs,&quot; the company wrote.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidi-as-latest-tech-makes-ai-voices-more-expressive-and-realistic-130021480.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16b6335c-93e7-4064-bc26-9dacadddfc78</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 13:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630398920</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T08:35:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a1b42b10-0a30-11ec-bf7f-c150e8837137" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a1b42b10-0a30-11ec-bf7f-c150e8837137" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA natural voice]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA natural voice]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's new feature-packed Elite 3 true wireless earbuds are only $80]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When it comes to true wireless earbuds, Jabra consistently covers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">nearly all the bases</a>. The company has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85t-review-130035415.html">continued to improve</a> design, features and technology since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-18-most-versatile-headphones-jabra-elite-65t.html">the Elite 65t</a>, but there was one thing it was still missing: a low-cost model for around $100. That changes today as Jabra is announcing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:the Elite 3" href="https://amzn.to/2WFvK4F">the Elite 3</a>: an $80 set of true wireless earbuds with more features than we typically see at this price.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the other two new models Jabra debuted today, the Elite 3 has a new design with smaller earbuds the company says are comfy enough for all-day wear. What&#39;s more, the buds are IP55 rated dust and water resistant so you won&#39;t have to worry about using them for workouts or if you get caught in the rain. Even with the lower price, you still get customizable on-board controls on each side with physical buttons instead of touch controls. Jabra gives you options like play/pause, track control, volume, voice assistant and one-touch access to Spotify. There&#39;s also the ability to activate HearThrough mode with a single press, the company&#39;s name for ambient sound. No on-board option for active noise cancellation (ANC) though because these earbuds only offer passive noise isolation.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/93adbdb0-09f4-11ec-8eed-1dae46871acc" alt="Jabra Elite 3" data-uuid="982737c9-1cef-338b-91ca-a0c318227784"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jabra</div></figure><p>Jabra says it set out to build a more affordable set of earbuds that &quot;still offers exceptional sound quality.&quot; To do so, the company relies on 6mm drivers along with aptX support. The Elite 3 has four microphones for calls, so you can use them with Zoom between podcasts. They&#39;re compatible with Jabra&#39;s Sound+ app as well, which will allow you to dial in the EQ, customize the on-board controls and more. Plus, the Elite 3 works with Google Fast Pair on Android devices so setup there should be quick and easy.&nbsp;</p><p>Jabra says the Elite 3 will last up to seven hours with three additional charges in the case. A fast charge feature gives you up to an hour of use after 10 minutes in the case. When the time comes to top off the entire set, you&#39;ll need a USB-C cable as this model doesn&#39;t support wireless charging.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Elite 3" href="https://amzn.to/2WFvK4F">Elite 3</a> will be available tomorrow (September 1st) from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Jabra&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/2YdOqJx">Jabra&#39;s website</a> and Amazon in dark grey, navy, beige and light purple color options for $79.99.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the Elite 3, Jabra also introduced a new flagship noise-cancelling model with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">Elite 7 Pro</a>. There&#39;s a sport version of those earbuds as well (Elite 7 Active), but the Pro offers adjustable ANC, customizable controls, long battery life and wireless charging.

Both the first- and second-gen versions of the compact smart display are on sale right now, with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:original Echo Show 5" href="https://amzn.to/3BtxcpS">original Echo Show 5</a> going for $45 and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:updated version" href="https://amzn.to/2V2oU8R">updated version</a>, which came out earlier this year, only $10 more.&nbsp;</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3BtxcpS" id="4f3fead060104e148b4f4e98efb3787c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Echo Show 5 (1st gen) at Amazon - $45</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2V2oU8R" id="20f022ba7b4242369837f1ede9b2055d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Echo Show 5 (2nd gen) at Amazon - $55</a><p>Unlike the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Echo Show 8</a>, the Show 5s are designed to fit neatly on your nightstand and act as smart alarm clocks. Each have a 5.5-inch, 960 x 480 touchscreen that shows the time along with things like weather forecasts, news headlines and more. They are also capable of making video calls thanks to their built-in camera and mics, and if you have multiple Alexa devices in your home, the Show 5s can be part of your larger intercom system. And when you need more privacy, you can shutter the camera and flip a switch to turn off the microphone. The smaller display isn&#39;t ideal for streaming video, but you are able to do so if you wish, along with music, podcasts, audiobooks and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-24-amazon-echo-show-5-review.html">Show 5</a> models shine as smart alarm clocks thanks to their sunrise alarm feature, which slowly brightens the screen 15 minutes before you&#39;re supposed to wake up, and tap-to-snooze function. Both also have an ambient light sensor that adjusts the screen&#39;s brightness depending on the light in your environment, so you&#39;ll never get woken up in the middle of the night by an ultra-bright display.</p><p>When it comes to differences between the first- and second-gen devices, there aren&#39;t many. The new Echo Show 5 has a 2MP camera, better than the 1MP camera in the first-gen, and it comes in a blue color in addition to the standard black and white options. Only those who plan on using the Show 5 to make video calls and drop in on family members would get the most out of the second-gen model — but when you can grab the latest version for only $10 more than the previous, it&#39;s not such a hard sell anymore.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-first-second-gen-echo-show-5-smart-display-sale-124330842.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fa69b719-4da5-4457-b237-9b4e79cdee7c</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 12:43:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630416920</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T13:35:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/2eb22170-07d0-11eb-a4f4-1fc4d6e97882" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/2eb22170-07d0-11eb-a4f4-1fc4d6e97882" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon&#39;s Echo Show 5s are cheaper than ever starting at $45]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netgear's 5G mobile hotspot router with WiFi 6 is now available for $700]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you often need to tether to get internet, Netgear has a very interesting new product — if you can afford it. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nighthawk M5 5G WiFi 6 Mobile Router" href="https://fave.co/2UZZDMm">Nighthawk M5 5G WiFi 6 Mobile Router</a> (unlocked) takes a 5G SIM card that&#39;s compatible with AT&amp;T and T-Mobile&#39;s networks. Once installed, it will distribute data over WiFi 6 to a maximum of 32 devices with greater range and speed than your smartphone could ever manage.&nbsp;</p><p>Powered by Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon X55 Mobile Platform, it delivers maximum theoretical speeds of up to 1.2Gbps over WiFi 11ax. While few if any devices can handle those speeds, the extra throughput will be handy if multiple devices are connected to it. The router also has a dedicated ethernet port that can deliver up to 1Gbps and connect to a device or mesh WiFi network, for instance. On top of 5GNR Sub 6 GHz, it supports LTE CAT 20, LTE Advanced, 4x4 MIMO and 256QAM.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Much like AT&amp;T and Netgear&#39;s original <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-25-atandt-netgear-mobile-hotspot-twice-lte-speeds.html">Nighthawk LTE router</a>, the 5G model can display pertinent information like the WiFi password and how much mobile data you&#39;ve used. Other features include VPN pass-through support and password protection, 13 hours on a battery charge (or remove the battery and plug into the wall for all-day use), and the ability to plug in wired internet to conserve data.</p><p>There is one pain point: the price. The Nighthawk M5 5G WiFi 6 Mobile Router costs $700, considerably more than <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-hotspot/#listicle-1d0e2c90-8925-4798-9a00-2af1c72d5627">other</a> 5G MiFi routers on the market. The main benefits are the fast speeds, the fact that it&#39;s unlocked to any carrier (though Netgear recommends AT&amp;T and T-Mobile) and the ethernet port.

You can clip the filters on to the camera&#39;s lens to saturate or deepen the contrast of your photos, or add new effects like starburst, red vignette, and orange, blue and yellow colors.</p><p>The new camera, which is out today for $150, is essentially an updated version of last year&#39;s Polaroid Now. This time, there&#39;s a new Blue Gray colorway (alongside white and black) that ditches the company&#39;s rainbow-colored strip for a more muted look. Polaroid also integrated the camera’s light sensor into the lens stage to accommodate the different filters. On top of the core autofocus, dynamic flash, and self-timer functions, the snapper now comes with a tripod mount.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What&#39;s more, Polaroid has made way for improvements on the software side.
