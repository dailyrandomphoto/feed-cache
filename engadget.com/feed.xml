On Monday, the company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/project-kuiper-announces-plans-and-launch-provider-for-prototype-satellites">filed</a> a license application with the Federal Communications Commission to launch two prototype satellites, KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2. They will feature many of the technologies the company plans to include in the final production variant of its constellation satellite, giving it the chance to test how those systems fare outside of a lab environment. At the same time, the tests will allow it to validate its launch procedures and mission management when it comes time to start putting its full network in orbit.</p><p>&quot;We’ve invented lots of new technology to meet our cost and performance targets for Project Kuiper. All of the systems are testing well in simulated and lab settings, and we’ll soon be ready to see how they perform in space,&quot; said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper. &quot;There is no substitute for on-orbit testing, and we expect to learn a lot given the complexity and risk of operating in such a challenging environment.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Amazon, it will launch KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 toward the end of 2022. Once the test is complete, the company plans to deorbit the satellites so they don’t add to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/were-entombing-the-earth-in-an-impenetrable-shell-of-dead-satellites-163002560.html"><ins>junk pile that’s circling the planet</ins></a>. Additionally, one of the satellites will feature a sunshade so Amazon can see if it helps make it less reflective and thereby less visible to telescopes on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>With today’s announcement, Amazon shared it’s working with ABL Space Systems to put KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 in space. The company’s new RS1 rocket will ferry the satellites to orbit. One of the main design features of Amazon’s Kuiper craft is that they’re compatible with multiple launch systems, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-project-kuiper-atlas-v-173405832.html"><ins>Atlas V</ins></a> rocket from United Launch Alliance.</p><p>Once it completes the test, Amazon will need to move quickly to put the entire system into space. When the FCC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fcc-approval-project-kuiper-065621687.html"><ins>approved its initial plan</ins></a>, the company said it would put half the satellites in orbit by 2026 and the entire constellation by July 30th, 2029.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-project-kuiper-test-2022-190551476.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">89b47068-2aed-490a-ac9e-fdb10215a4ca</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 19:05:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635793497</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T19:05:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c689e1f0-3b45-11ec-bfe4-6811c6a1b4b8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c689e1f0-3b45-11ec-bfe4-6811c6a1b4b8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Project Kuiper]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Project Kuiper]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chevrolet's 1957 Project X car is now an EV]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most famous cars <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chevrolet/"><ins>Chevrolet</ins></a> ever built is now an electric vehicle. The company <a href="https://media.chevrolet.com/media/us/en/chevrolet/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/nov/1101-projectx.html"><ins>teamed up</ins></a> with Cagnazzi Racing and <em>Hot Rod</em> publisher MotorTrend to electrify the 1957 Chevy Project X vehicle.</p><p>MotorTrend&#39;s defunct <em>Popular Hot Rodding </em>magazine bought the Project X car for $250 in 1965. Over the decades, it has been used to test a range of power technologies. Before the electric system, it had a Chevy LSX V-8 engine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The car now has a 400-volt electric powertrain with an estimated 340 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque — those are very similar numbers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cadillacs-lyriq-ev-will-boast-300-plus-miles-of-range-130020680.html">Cadillac&#39;s Lyriq EV</a>. Chevrolet says the battery can store 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity. The range depends on the quick-change differential that&#39;s fitted, which can be swapped to optimize the car for acceleration or range. Still, Chevy claims the now-EV has &quot;enough range for weekend cruising.&quot;</p><p>Although the car still has the front suspension that was installed in 2007, Cagnazzi Racing made some changes, such as swapping to an electric brake booster and electrohydraulic power steering pump. Some springs have been switched too, as there&#39;s less weight under the hood and more at the rear compared with the previous incarnation. Project X now has the same push-button gear selector as the 2021 Chevrolet Corvette as well.</p><p>This is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-09-chevy-e-10-concept-electric-hot-rod-truck.html">third straight year</a> that Chevy has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevy-k5-blazer-e-project-191600554.html"><ins>converted a classic car</ins></a> into an EV for SEMA.

The chipmaker says it will <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/11/01/qualcomm-announces-goal-achieve-net-zero-emissions-2040">achieve net-zero emissions by 2040</a>. Here’s the roadmap the company laid out. By 2030, Qualcomm says it will reduce its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent from base 2020 levels. That same year, it plans to reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 25 percent from where they were in 2020.</p><p>Scope 1 includes all pollution produced directly by the company or any emissions sources it owns or controls. Scope 2, meanwhile, entails indirect emissions created from the electricity, heating and cooling Qualcomm consumes. Lastly, Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions produced by its value chain.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the context of a company like Qualcomm that relies on TSMC, Samsung and other foundries to produce its chips, reducing its Scope 3 emissions is the most impactful (and difficult) way the company can lessen its impact on the environment. According to an <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apple-joins-as-first-public-partner-in-new-imec-research-program-that-helps-entire-semiconductor-value-chain-reduce-its-ecological-footprint-301410552.html">estimate from Imec</a>, which recently announced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/imec-ssts-sustainable-chip-program-141057882.html">sustainable chip program</a> involving Apple, approximately 75 percent of the greenhouse emissions tied to a mobile device are produced when it’s made, with almost half coming from the chip fabrication process.</p><p>Notably, that’s where Qualcomm says the least about its sustainability plans. It notes it’s working towards purchasing all of the power it uses at its San Diego headquarters from renewable sources and decarbonizing its operations using a “minimal” amount of Renewable Energy Credits and carbon offsets. That’s not to say the company is trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-big-tech-greenwashing-its-environmental-responsibilities-ahead-of-cop-26-170038455.html">greenwash</a> its environmental responsibilities, but there’s a significant difference between making its offices environmentally friendly and doing the same for its supply chain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-net-zero-2040-174555511.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">65f1ec4e-eda9-4094-ba46-a188b6c56925</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 17:45:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635792149</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T18:42:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Pollution & Waste]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/634e8e30-3b39-11ec-bbef-8d13d3769dd4" width="6351" height="4236" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/634e8e30-3b39-11ec-bbef-8d13d3769dd4" width="6351" height="4236" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Qualcomm sign is shown outside one of the company's many buildings in San Diego, California, U.S., September 17, 2020.

Facebook shared details of the network in its <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/october-2021-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-report/">monthly report</a> on coordinated inauthentic behavior on the platform.</p><p>In addition to hundreds of fake accounts on its platform, the troll farm also operated a “a complex network of media brands” on Blogspot, Wordpress and Telegram, Facebook said in a statement. Some fake accounts posed as government supporters, while some posed as university students, who led protests against the government in 2018. The fake account also mass-reported activists and other government critics in an attempt to get them banned from Facebook. Beginning in 2019, the group also began &quot;posting and artificially amplifying praise about the Nicaraguan government and the ruling FSLN party.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While it’s not the first time Facebook has caught a government running this kind of operation, Facebook said the Nicaraguan effort was unique because they were able to link it to multiple government institutions, including the Social Security Institute and Supreme Court. The country’s post office headquarters Managua served as a “main hub” for the troll farm, and government workers even appeared to post on a regular 9am-5pm schedule.</p><p>“This was really the closest thing we&#39;ve yet seen to a whole-of-government operation,” Facebook’s Global Threat Intelligence Lead for Influence Operations, Ben Nimmo, said during a call with reporters. “This is the first time that I can think of [that] we&#39;ve seen so many different institutions getting involved.”</p><p>It’s also notable that Facebook traced the start of the operation back to 2018, meaning much of the activity went undetected for years. Nimmo noted that while the company’s automated systems were able to detect and disable some of the fake accounts in 2018, the operation was “complex” and time-consuming to investigate.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-takes-down-government-run-troll-farm-in-nicaragua-173235024.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cae1a942-db7a-4059-a195-dae56b5b36e1</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 17:32:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635787956</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T17:32:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1a81c630-387e-11ec-bf62-031fa403c017" width="3790" height="2551" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1a81c630-387e-11ec-bf62-031fa403c017" width="3790" height="2551" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook logo and new company brand Meta Platforms Inc. logo are pictured in this illustrative photo taken in Kyiv on 29 October, 2021.

I wish that anyone — <em>anyone</em> — other than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-adidas-algae-yeezys.html">Kanye West</a> had released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kanye-west-donda-stem-player-164315448.html">Stem Player</a>. At this point he’s more than 10 years past the creative zenith of <em>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</em>, and five years removed from the uneven, but decent <em>Life of Pablo.</em> These days, his cultural relevance is driven more by spectacle and controversy than artistic output.</p><p>Still, I can’t help but be drawn to the <a href="https://www.stemplayer.com/">Donda Stem Player</a>: It’s a fascinating and unique device. But my interest is in spite of, not because of Kanye West.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f85bc380-3990-11ec-a6f7-3bc4fed2e03f" alt="Donda Stem Player" data-uuid="0e996dc4-3772-3f18-b75c-ba985033d2f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>So what is it? Well, it’s basically a tiny puck-shaped computer dedicated specifically to remixing Kanye’s latest album. Using it you can change the volume of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/courtney-barnett-stem-mixer-155740890.html">different stems</a>, or tracks, in the songs on Donda. For instance, if you’re wondering what “Off the Grid” would sound like as an instrumental you can simply turn down the vocals. Or if you find the sonar ping synth in “Jonah” unbearable, just turn it off. You can also create loops of little song chunks, reverse them, speed them up, slow them down and even add effects.</p><p>It looks kinda like a sex toy, though, and is covered in what I assume are surplus <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-13-finally-a-good-digital-masturbator.html">Fleshlights</a>. It doesn’t feel unpleasant, exactly, but it is slightly unnerving. And the vaguely fleshy hue doesn’t help matters. The main controls on the front are four touch-sensitive strips that light up to tell you what volume a track is at or what effect you’ve selected, for instance. The whole thing vibrates, too, with haptic feedback every time you touch a button or a strip, though it can lag behind your actual touch quite a bit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f8494cf0-3990-11ec-b77d-629ae32a9a10" alt="Donda Stem Player" data-uuid="bea7553a-5d92-3dee-8fea-9cb7ffa35154"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>One of the limitations here is that it tops out at four stems. This often means all the melodic content is one track. I’ll also say that the effect selection leaves something to be desired. There are two different speeds of tremolo, a few different echo options and “feedback” which is basically just an out of control echo.</p><p>Being able to quickly loop a chunk of music, reverse and slap some reverb on it is kinda fun. It allows you to transform a song into something completely unrecognizable, but it’s not super useful as a practical remix tool.</p><p>I was somewhat disappointed by the Stem Player’s ability to handle non-<em>Donda</em> tracks. The site promises that you can upload any song to the player. You can even drop in a YouTube link and it will parse out the audio. Then it will automatically split the song into stems so you can remix it. This is no easy task, even for pro-grade software on a high-powered PC. Predictably, it&#39;s hit or miss here.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f85c38b1-3990-11ec-8ff3-0c31daadcdbc" alt="Donda Stem Player" data-uuid="8f4e47a7-6380-34e5-8b2a-cbbfd18622ca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Stem Player handled “DIRTY!” from JPEGMAFIA and “Stonefruit” by Armand Hammer reasonably well, though there was some slight bleed through of the synth line into the vocal stem on “Stonefruit.” Nine Inch Nail’s “Closer” fared a little worse. Half the bass line was on its own track, while the other half was lumped in with the drums. It even bled into the vocals. There was also a decent amount of digital artifacts in the stems.</p><p>It would seem that fairly stripped-down hip hop productions will do ok, but as the complexity of a song increases the Stem Player starts to struggle parsing the different parts. The Armed’s “An Iteration,” for example, was broken down into drums, vocals and a single track of everything else. Then the fourth stem, which is supposed to be for bass, was basically silent. In fact, I often encountered this issue with music I uploaded to the Stem Player myself. Badbadnotgood’s “Love Proceeding” was reduced to just two stems: drums and not drums.</p><section data-eng-breakout="41fe1a0726fd49659a0d06206d024cd5" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f85b9c73-3990-11ec-b7df-a16192ba21a4" alt="Donda Stem Player"></section><p>I have concerns about what happens to the Stem Player in a few years or even months time, too. The only way to upload new songs to it is through the <a href="https://www.stemplayer.com/">Stem Player</a> website. So if that ever goes offline you might be stuck. I also can’t figure out how to get mixes and songs off the player. The instructions both included with the player and on the site are pretty barebones and at times, slightly confusing. In the FAQ it says you can save what you’re mixing by pressing the volume up button then it explains that “four recordings can be saved, play back from the final, red track.” The only problem is, I have no idea what the hell that means.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest knock against the Stem Player is the price. $200 is a lot to throw at a musical curiosity. Especially when that money mostly serves to feed the ego of one of the most megalomaniacal celebrities in the world.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/donda-stem-player-kanye-west-kano-hands-on-150038410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ece58306-327e-404d-9ac5-a66e76fc373d</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 15:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635770595</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T12:43:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/26c39f00-3b11-11ec-b7bd-01f83d267b57" width="703" height="469" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f85c38b2-3990-11ec-86af-8d8d64e49889" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Donda Stem Player]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Donda Stem Player]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon begins early Black Friday sales on its own devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though Black Friday is over three weeks away, some major retailers are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-early-black-friday-tech-deals-so-far-november-1-2021-amazon-best-buy-123511788.html"><ins>getting in on the action early</ins></a>.

After some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-leak-191933131.html">early hints</a> in iOS 15.1, the company has formally announced the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beats Fit Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3pUcWLk">Beats Fit Pro</a>. This set of true wireless earbuds has a similar look to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">Studio Buds</a> that debuted earlier this year with an added fit wing, or &quot;wingtip&quot; as the company calls it. Combined with an IPX4 rating, the $200 Fit Pro are well-suited for workouts but are also packed with the best features from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">Apple&#39;s new AirPods</a> for all-day use.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to Apple&#39;s H1 chip, the Beats Fit Pro offers hands-free access to Siri, one-touch pairing, the latest Find My features in iOS, automatic device switching and audio sharing. Apple&#39;s fancy new skin detection sensor that improves the accuracy of automatic pausing is also on board. Beats says H1 also powers the ear tip fit test that&#39;s built into the earbuds&#39; settings through iOS. The Beats Fit Pro also have Adaptive EQ like the latest AirPods, a feature that continuously scans and adjusts low- and mid-range frequencies using computational audio and in-ward facing mics. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio-now-available-174616634.html">Spatial audio</a> and dynamic head tracking, also key elements of Apple&#39;s new earbuds, are available on the Beats Fit Pro as well.

The company says its ANC setup &quot;continuously adapts in real time,&quot; scanning and adjusting up to 200 times per second to counter any changes &quot;in fit and movement.&quot; There&#39;s also a transparency mode that allows you to hear what&#39;s going on around you when needed. With both ANC and transparency turned off, Adaptive EQ takes over to keep things sounding as good as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Beats says new custom transducer and vent system have helped improve overall audio quality. There&#39;s also a new acoustic design that delivers what the company describes as &quot;impressive dynamic range and clarity across the frequency curve.&quot; On the outside, on-board controls give you the ability to play music and take calls without reaching for your phone. Beats gives you the option to customize the long press action for on-board volume control if you&#39;d prefer that to easy access to noise control (ANC, transparency and off). During calls, the company says beamforming microphones focus on your voice while internal mics and an accelerometer work to filter out environmental noise. Spatial audio in Group FaceTime won&#39;t be available on the Beats Fit Pro at launch, but the feature will come in a future update.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/923e9320-3b11-11ec-bf1b-95650fbef9f8" alt="Beats Fit Pro" data-uuid="9b06a1a5-696e-3654-8a80-e062bae96403"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Beats</div></figure><p>Beats is promising up to six hours of listening time with ANC or transparency mode active, plus another 21 hours in the charging case. When you turn those off and use the Fit Pro in Adaptive EQ mode you can expect up to seven hours on the buds with 27 more in the case. The case doesn&#39;t support wireless charging but it does offer a Fast Fuel feature that gives you an hour of play time in five minutes. While everything iOS users need for the Beats Fit Pro is built into that software, Android users will need to download the Beats app. The app offers one-touch pairing, the fit test, the ability to change listening modes and customization of the long press action.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beats Fit Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3pUcWLk">Beats Fit Pro</a> are available for pre-order today for $200 from Apple&#39;s website and other retailers in the US. Color options include black, white, grey and purple. The earbuds will begin shipping on November 5th with availability in China in early December. Beats says the Fit Pro will be available &quot;in additional regions&quot; next year. New subscribers also get six months of Apple Music with the purchase of Beats Fit Pro.</p><p>Read our full review of the Beats Fit Pro <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">right here</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-announced-specs-price-availability-140008207.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8a0ff618-b32f-489d-a3b7-261d0d957fe3</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 14:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635775839</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T14:10:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ef5ba610-3b0c-11ec-b3fd-cc4d57ef49b1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ef5ba610-3b0c-11ec-b3fd-cc4d57ef49b1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Beats]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro review: All the perks of AirPods with a more comfortable design]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thanks to some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-leak-191933131.html">early hints</a> in iOS 15.1, Beats’ latest earbuds are hardly a surprise. Today the company officially debuted its latest model: the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$200 Beats Fit Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3nNxsL5">$200 Beats Fit Pro</a>. With a similar design to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">Studio Buds</a> that arrived earlier this year, this <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-announced-specs-price-availability-140008207.html">new pair</a> offers active noise cancellation (ANC) alongside almost all of the features from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">Apple’s third-generation AirPods</a>. That includes hands-free Siri, Adaptive EQ, spatial audio and more. Beats has also added a wing for a more secure fit during workouts and kept the IPX4 rating from the Studio Buds. All of those features, combined with a more attractive design, gives the company an alternative to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-16-beats-powerbeats-pro-review.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> in its lineup.</p><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><p>If you’re thinking the Beats Fit Pro look almost exactly like the Beats Studio Buds, you’re not wrong. This new model is a smidge larger and the angle of the tab that holds the on-board controls is slightly different. The overall aesthetic and shape are pretty much identical, though. The biggest design difference is the fit wing, or wingtip as Beats calls it. Unlike a lot of sporty earbuds, this element is very flexible so it can bend to fit a greater range of ear shapes. That also makes it more comfortable. Even though the wing is helping keep the buds in place, you hardly know it’s there.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like the Studio Buds, the on-board controls for the Beats Fit Pro are on the lowercase ‘b’ logo on the outside of each earbud. They’re still physical buttons you have to press rather than touch controls built for tapping. Controls are mirrored on each side by default, with options for play/pause and answering calls (single press) in addition to skipping tracks (twice for forward, three times for back) and cycling between ANC on and transparency mode (long press). The long press can be reconfigured for volume control, allowing you to turn it up on one side and down on the other. If you do this, you lose the ability to access noise cancellation or ambient sound mode. Bummer.</p><p>Beats says it strategically positioned the button for the on-board controls at the bottom of the hump on each earbud “to avoid accidental presses.” Just like I encountered on the Studio Buds, I frequently activated the controls when trying to adjust the fit of the earbuds. With the wingtip I had to do this less often than the previous model, but it was still annoying to want to secure the buds in my ear only to errantly pause the audio or change the noise control mode. And due to the positioning of the microphones, any fit adjustment usually meant touching the external mics and creating extra noise.</p><p>Apple’s new wear detection sensor sits around back. Like the tech on the new AirPods, the Beats Fit Pro have an optical sensor outfitted with wavelength LEDs that can determine if an object is skin in addition to proximity. Both Apple and Beats explain that this makes the automatic pausing more accurate, avoiding accidental activation when you don’t actually have them in your ear. Of course, this also helps save battery life when you’re less likely to erroneously turn them on.</p><h2><strong>Software and features</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/15229d90-3b08-11ec-b8db-a2e2b6e37794" alt="Beats&#x002019; latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple&#x002019;s new AirPods in a less polarizing design." data-uuid="0308597c-1623-306d-8106-2d1cc02c9034"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Thanks to Apple’s H1 chip, the Beats Fit Pro have a lot of the same features as the new AirPods. Those include one-touch pairing, where even the first time you open the case, all you have to do is tap a pop-up on your iPhone and the earbuds are connected. Messing with a Bluetooth menu and putting a device in pairing mode are both relics of a bygone era. H1 also powers hands-free Siri and Apple’s enhanced Find My features. Lastly, you get Audio Sharing too, so you can listen to music or watch a movie with someone who has a set of earbuds or headphones made by Apple or Beats.</p><p>In terms of software, everything you need for Beats Fit Pro is built into iOS 15 for iPhone users. From Control Center, you can easily access noise control and spatial audio settings with a long press on the volume slider. You can reassign the press-and-hold on-board control from the ‘i’ icon next to the device name in the Bluetooth menu. An ear tip fit test resides there too, just like it does for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a>, and you can disable automatic ear detection as well. Noise and spatial audio controls are located on this menu too if you’d prefer to access them here. On Android devices, Beats has a dedicated app that handles fast pairing and includes the ear tip fit test, control customization and battery status features available on iOS.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1517ef30-3b08-11ec-bebd-a5bd5f0805b4" alt="Beats&#x002019; latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple&#x002019;s new AirPods in a less polarizing design." data-uuid="3e46730b-2d43-3731-ba06-96f19bd77d5b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Beats says it completely redesigned its proprietary transducer for the Fit Pro, creating “an entirely custom acoustic architecture” and promising balanced and powerful sound. That last bit is immediately apparent the first time you fire up these earbuds. There’s much more low-end tone on this model than what the Studio Buds offer. The punchier bass establishes more depth as well, so there’s more room for vocals, instruments and other elements to come through without sounding compressed or boring.</p><p>Indeed, guitars ring out in the chaotic metal of Every Time I Die, with bombastic drums booming underneath. The bass is ample and never overpowers, even with genres where things can get out of hand quickly when the tuning is the slightest bit off. There’s a clarity on the Fit Pro that’s well suited for genres like blues, bluegrass, ambient, electronic and more. Across all of those genres, the crisp details highlight Beats’ full range of tones. Bass, fiddle, guitar and mandolin all stand on their own for acts like Nickel Creek, giving space for each to shine. There’s no doubt the sound profile here is an improvement over the Studio Buds, but it’s not on the level of pricer sets like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/master-and-dynamic-mw08-review-true-wireless-earbuds-143027692.html">MW08</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-19-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review.html">Momentum True Wireless 2</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">WF-1000XM4</a>.</p><p>Thanks to the H1 chip, Beats Fit Pro work with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio-now-available-174616634.html">Apple’s spatial audio</a>. This gives you the ability to listen to Dolby Atmos Music content in Apple Music — with or without dynamic head tracking enabled. Spatial audio is also available for these earbuds on Apple TV or movies and TV shows streamed iPhone or iPad. Like the latest AirPods, the Fit Pro are equipped with Apple’s Adaptive EQ. This feature is active when you disable both ANC and transparency mode, continuously monitoring sound with internal microphones and adjusting the low- and mid-range frequencies to keep the audio quality consistent. The feature also takes into account the shape of your ear when making its tweaks.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="cb520cc2-4e64-47fa-a3c3-a1a89a5da6e7"/><p>As I’ve already mentioned, the Beats Fit Pro have active noise cancellation on board. It’s another feature powered by Apple’s H1 chip and it, too, adapts to both ambient noise and how the earbuds fit in your ears. Like previous Beats headphones, this tech continuously monitors and automatically adjusts based on the environmental clamor. Beats says the system is powered by an algorithm that can adapt the signal 200 times per second. That looks nice on paper, but at the end of the day, all you need to know is the ANC system on the Fit Pro does a solid job of blocking distractions when you need it to. It’s not as powerful as Bose or Sony, but it counters distractions well enough to come in handy.</p><p>As is typically the case with noise-cancelling earbuds these days, the Fit Pro also offer a transparency mode for tuning into your surroundings. There’s no denying this tool is helpful in certain scenarios when you need to pay some attention to what’s going on around you. However, like the Studio Buds, these don’t feed your voice back into the earbuds when you talk, so you have to speak up to hear yourself. Still, transparency mode will help you keep an ear out for your name at a coffee shop.</p><h2><strong>Call quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1515f360-3b08-11ec-bbff-df8dcbd12571" alt="Beats&#x002019; latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple&#x002019;s new AirPods in a less polarizing design." data-uuid="664da67f-6bc1-398e-8ea2-6816c0f22ac1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>For calls, Beats equipped the Fit Pro with six microphones: three on each side. External beamforming mics focus on your voice while the internal units for ANC, transparency mode and Adaptive EQ pull double duty to help improve calls. The company says the feed-forward microphones are recessed to avoid wind issues and a voice accelerometer counters external noise with the help of “an advanced algorithm.”</p><p>All earbud companies make some version of this pitch with a mix of mics, algorithms and strategic placement. Mileage varies greatly with these promises and more often than not they don’t hold up. With the Fit Pro, your voice sounds better than speakerphone, but it comes across muffled on the other end. The person you’re speaking to will also get ample background noise if it’s loud enough. At the end of the day, these will work fine if you’re in a decently quiet space, but don’t expect them to block out a noisy office when you have a phone or video call.</p><p>When they first arrive, the Beats Fit Pro won’t support Apple’s new Group FaceTime spatial audio. The feature employs immersive sound so that participants sound like they’re speaking from the location they are on your screen. Apple says this makes FaceTime calls more natural, and it does to a degree. It definitely enhances the experience of a meeting or group chat, but it’s still far from real life. Beats says it plans to add this feature to the Fit Pro as part of a future software update.</p><h2><strong>Battery life</strong></h2><p>Beats is promising up to six hours of use on the earbuds with ANC or transparency mode active. When you factor in the additional 21 hours in the case, that’s 27 hours of listening time with the most attractive features turned on. If you opt to skip those and go with Adaptive EQ mode, you can expect an extra hour on the Beats Fit Pro and three more in the case for a total of 30. As always, the company has included its Fast Fuel feature that offers an hour of noise-cancelling playback with a five-minute charge.</p><p>Battery life claims are rarely an issue with Beats gear and that holds true here. Using a mix of active noise cancellation and transparency mode throughout the day, I managed nearly seven hours before completely depleting the power. I missed it by about 10 minutes. That’s enough to get you through a full day at the office, and if you can dock the buds at some point, you’ll have no trouble wearing them during your commute either. All of these figures are on par with the new AirPods, but Apple’s latest don’t have ANC. Our current top pick for best earbuds, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">Sony’s WF-1000XM4</a>, lasted seven and a half hours during my tests with noise cancellation active.</p><h2><strong>The competition</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1517c821-3b08-11ec-abff-1c411818f31c" alt="Beats&#x002019; latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple&#x002019;s new AirPods in a less polarizing design." data-uuid="c4541c43-00b5-3854-81fb-2809a38776c9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Beats has a more affordable alternative to the Fit Pro in its lineup. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">Studio Buds</a> will save you $50, but you’ll have to make some sacrifices. First, and perhaps most importantly, the sound quality isn’t nearly as good. It lacks the punchy bass and overall depth the Fit Pro exhibits. The Studio Buds don’t have Apple’s H1 chip, but you still get quick pairing and hands-free Siri in addition to the ability to listen to Dolby Atmos tunes in Apple Music. What you won’t find is Adaptive EQ or the new skin-activated wear detection sensor.</p><p>The absolute best true wireless earbuds you can buy right now are still the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">Sony WF-1000XM4</a>. As feature-packed as the Fit Pro are, the handy features are most useful for iOS. Sony goes beyond ANC to include automatic pausing when you speak and quick attention mode for short conversations. You can also fully automate your noise-cancelling or transparency levels on the WF-1000XM4 based on your activity or location. Of course, that’s if you’re willing to trade some privacy for convenience.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>If you’re looking for the best of what AirPods has to offer in earbuds that don’t have the polarizing stick apparatus, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beats Fit Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3nNxsL5">Beats Fit Pro</a> should do the trick. They offer a nice blend of features, sound and noise-cancelling performance for the price. Sure, there are better options but they also cost significantly more, especially if you’re looking for the absolute best audio quality. For now, Beats is giving the masses an AirPods alternative that’s actually still packed with Apple tech. And that’s an interesting proposition for iPhone owners.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0d8fb3fc-c497-4401-b9bb-955dd028baed</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 14:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635775793</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T14:09:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/fafc5220-3b08-11ec-ad9d-4be2ad921dcb" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/fafc5220-3b08-11ec-ad9d-4be2ad921dcb" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats’ latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple’s new AirPods in a less polarizing design.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly working on a way for iPhones to detect car crashes and auto-dial 911]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your iPhone might have a new capability as soon as next year: detecting a car accident and automatically dialing 911. Apple plans to unveil a feature called &quot;crash detection&quot; for both iPhones and Watches, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-wants-iphones-to-detect-car-crashes-auto-dial-911-11635768001"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> report. The feature would supposedly use sensors like the accelerometer built into Apple devices.</p><p>Apple has reportedly been working on the feature for several years and testing it using real world data. According to documents seen by the <em>WSJ</em>, Apple has been collecting data shared anonymously from iPhone and Watch users. It has detected more than 10 million suspected vehicle impacts, with more than 50,000 of those accompanied by a call to 911. Apple has been using that data to improve the accuracy of its crash-detection algorithm, since a 911 emergency call is pretty solid confirmation of a serious crash.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s certainly not first to the gate with this.

Thanks to the latest round of hardware from Intel, Apple, AMD and NVIDIA, all of our portable devices have gotten steadily faster and more efficient. Even the cheapest iPad can be a decent productivity machine, while gaming laptops now have almost all of the power of their desktop siblings. And with the arrival of Windows 11, it&#39;s a perfect time to give someone a nifty PC upgrade, especially since very old computers won’t be able to step up.</p><h2>Dell XPS 13</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e6f9dbe1-3b11-11ec-af23-4fb2fd94f0b4" alt="Dell XPS 13 for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="dd17fb18-63a4-3291-981a-0cf4f8b152a2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>Not to sound like a broken record, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 13" href="https://bit.ly/3mLfCrz">XPS 13</a> is still the best Windows ultraportable you can buy.

The XPS 13 can also be configured with an OLED screen, an ideal gift for someone who could use a bright and color accurate display.

It&#39;s powerful enough to handle most productivity tasks and a few games, and whoever’s lucky enough to get it won’t have to worry about any fans spinning up, since it’s completely passively cooled.

The Pixel 6 has avoided that trend so far, but it still has a few minor issues around the display, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/01/pixel-6-pro-flickering-issue/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> has reported. Users noticed that when the Pixel 6 Pro is off, pressing the power button with slight pressure (not enough to turn it on) seems to activate a strange display &quot;flicker.&quot; This doesn&#39;t affect the device when it&#39;s on.</p><p>In a <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/133351387/pixel-6-pro-display-residual-light?hl=en">support document</a>, Google acknowledged the issue and said it will be fixed in the December software update. In the meantime, it gave the following instructions: &quot;To avoid seeing this, when the power is off, do not cycle the power button. When you want to use the phone, hold the power button down long enough to turn it on.&quot; Google added that it&#39;s not &quot;an issue with the phone hardware,&quot; meaning a software update will handle the problem.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The November patch has just been released today, with the main fix being a tweak to the Internet Quick Settings panel. As such, it&#39;ll take another month or so to fix the flickering issues. With the Pixel 6 being Google&#39;s first smartphone with its own <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-soc-pixel-6-chip-170059466.html">Tensor processor</a>, hopefully we won&#39;t see any major hardware issues.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-confirms-pixel-6-pro-display-flickering-issue-will-be-fixed-next-month-122533947.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b1ce53e-0333-45e9-af6c-152376e5adc1</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 12:25:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635767480</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T11:51:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7344eb80-3b03-11ec-be9b-4d151927a611" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7344eb80-3b03-11ec-be9b-4d151927a611" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google's next Pixel Pro update will fix a display flickering issue]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google's next Pixel Pro update will fix a display flickering issue]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's new AirPods Pro with MagSafe are down to $190 at Best Buy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update 9:57am ET:</strong> Amazon has now matched Best Buy&#39;s sale price, bringing the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:new AirPods Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3mwvcbx">new AirPods Pro</a> down to $190.</p><p>Apple only rolled out the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-apple-airpods-third-generation-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-m1-pro-m1-max-182308261.html">MagSafe charging case</a> option for the AirPods Pro wireless earbuds just two weeks ago, but they&#39;ve already going on sale for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-new-air-pods-pro-are-already-seeing-their-first-discount-083108462.html">second time</a>.

They also offer touch controls that let you easily switch modes between, say, noise cancellation and &quot;Transparency&quot; mode that lets you hear conversations, street noise and more.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Apple device compatibility is the most attractive feature compared to, say, Sony&#39;s WF-1000XM4 wireless earphones. That allows you to rapidly switch between an iPhone, iPad and MacBook computer. Battery life is as high as 5 hours without ANC or Transparency modes, or 4.5 hours of listening time (3.5 hours of talk time) with ANC turned on.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of its new AirPods and MacBook Pro <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-introducing-apples-new-mac-book-pros-and-air-pods-111537777.html">launch</a>, Apple gave the AirPods Pro a MagSafe charging case.

So be thankful for the most underappreciated of your five senses, one that robots may soon themselves enjoy. Facebook announced on Monday that it has developed a suite of tactile technologies that will impart a sense of touch into robots that the mad doctor could never imagine.</p><p>But why is Facebook even bothering to look into robotics research at all? “Before I joined Facebook, I was chatting with Mark Zuckerberg, and I asked him, ‘Is there any area related to AI that you think we shouldn&#39;t be working on?’ Yann LeCun, Facebook’s chief AI scientist recalled during a recent press call. “And he said, ‘I can&#39;t find any good reason for us to work on robotics,’ so that was the start of our FAIR [Facebook AI Research] research, that we&#39;re not going to work on robotics.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Then, after a few years,” he continued, “it became clear that a lot of interesting progress in AI work is happening in the context of robotics because this is the nexus of where people in AI research are trying to get to; the full loop of perception, reasoning, planning and action, and then getting feedback from the from the environment.”</p><p>As such, FAIR has centered its tactile technology research on four main areas of study —  hardware, simulation, processing and perception. We’ve already seen FAIR’s hardware efforts: the DIGIT, a “<a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/digit-a-novel-design-for-a-low-cost-compact-high-resolution-tactile-sensor-with-application-to-in-hand-manipulation/"><ins>low-cost, compact high-resolution tactile sensor</ins></a>” that Facebook first announced in 2020. Unlike conventional tactile sensors, which typically rely on capacitive or resistive methods, DIGIT is actually vision-based.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f3834840-3802-11ec-b9ff-681af79cc27f" style="height:831;width:1920;" alt="DIGIT world view" data-uuid="e0465ced-9d61-3ee5-9df8-120d3d8745c0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAIR</div></figure><p>“Inside the sensors there is a camera, there are RGB LEDs placed around the silicon, and then there is a silicon gel,” Facebook AI Research Scientist, Roberto Calandra, explained. “Whenever we touch the silicone on an object, this is going to create shadows or changes in color cues that are then recorded by the collar. These allow [DIGIT] to have extremely high resolution and extremely high spectral sensitivity while having a device which is mechanically very robust, and very easy and cheap to produce.”</p><p>Calandra noted that DIGIT costs about $15 to produce and, being open source hardware, its production schematics are available to universities and research institutions with fabrication capabilities. It’s also available for sale, thanks to a partnership with <a href="https://gelsight.com/"><ins>GelSight</ins></a>, to researchers (and even members of the public) who can’t build their own.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3ca3ae20-3803-11ec-8fef-6beb27f1d131" style="height:1174;width:2080;" alt="digit egg" data-uuid="ca3d46fe-3e5e-3231-bb3d-6ab42a9506a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAIR</div></figure><p>In terms of simulation, which allows ML systems to train in a virtual environment without the need to collect heaps of real-world hardware data (much the same way <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-11-waymo-simulation-testing.html"><ins>Waymo has refined its self-driving vehicle systems over the course of 10 billion computer generated miles</ins></a>), FAIR has developed TACTO. This system can generate hundreds of frames of realistic high-resolution touch readings per second as well as simulate vision-based tactile sensors like DIGIT so that researchers don’t have to spend hours upon hours tapping on sensors to create a compendium of real-world training data.</p><p>“Today if you want to use reinforcement learning, for example, to train a car to drive itself,” LeCun pointed out, “it would have to it would have to be done in your turn environment because it would have to drive for millions of hours, cause you know countless thousands of accidents and destroy itself multiple times before it burns its way around and even then it probably wouldn&#39;t be very reliable. So how is it that humans are capable of learning to drive a car with 10 to 20 hours of practice with hardly any supervision?”</p><p>“It&#39;s because, by the time we turn 16 or 17, we have a pretty good model of the world,” he continued. We inherently understand the implications of what would happen if we drove a car off a cliff because we’ve had nearly two decades of experience with the concept of gravity as well as that of fucking around and finding out. “So ‘how to get machines to learn that model of the world that allows them to predict events and plan what&#39;s going to happen as a consequence of their actions’ is really the crux of the problem here.”</p><p>Sensors and simulators are all well and good, assuming you’ve got an advanced Comp Sci degree and a deep understanding of ML training procedure. But many aspiring roboticists don’t have those sorts of qualifications so, in order to broaden the availability of DIGIT and TACTO, FAIR has developed PyTouch — not to be confused with <a href="https://pytorch.org/"><ins>PyTorch</ins></a>. While Torch is a machine learning library focusing primarily on vision-based and NLP libraries, PyTouch centers on touch sensing applications.</p><p>“Researchers can simply connect their DIGIT, download a pretrained model and use this as a building block in their robotic application,” Calandra and Facebook AI Hardware Engineer, Mike Lambeta, wrote in a blog published Monday. “For example, to build a controller that grasps objects, researchers could detect whether the controller’s fingers are in contact by downloading a module from PyTouch.”</p><p>Most recently, FAIR (in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University) has developed ReSkin, a touch-sensitive “skin” for robots and wearables alike. “This deformable elastomer has micro-magnetic particles in it,” Facebook AI Research Manager, Abhinav Gupta, said. “And then we have electronics — a thin flexible PCB, which is essentially a grid of magnetometers. The sensing technology behind the skin is very simple: if you apply force into it, the elastomer will deform and, as it deforms, it changes the magnetic flux which is read [by] magnetometers.”</p><p>“A generalized tactile sensing skin like ReSkin will provide a source of rich contact data that could be helpful in advancing AI in a wide range of touch-based tasks including object classification, proprioception, and robotic grasping,” Gupta wrote in a recent FAIR blog. “AI models trained with learned tactile sensing skills will be capable of many types of tasks, including those that require higher sensitivity, such as working in health care settings, or greater dexterity, such as maneuvering small, soft, or sensitive objects.”</p><p>Despite being relatively inexpensive to produce — 100 units cost about $6 to make — ReSkin is surprisingly durable. The 2-3mm thick material lasts for up to 50,000 touches while generating high-frequency, 3-axis tactile signals and while retaining a temporal resolution of up to 400Hz and a spatial resolution of 1mm with 90 percent accuracy. Once a swath of ReSkin reaches its usable limits, replacing “the skin is as easy as taking a bandaid off and putting a new bandaid on,” Gupta quipped.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d2019860-3803-11ec-b67f-04daf414300e" style="height:432;width:768;" alt="ReSkin Berry" data-uuid="91b024d3-c6e5-3f9b-bbc8-a0188ef4b05e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAIR</div></figure><p>Given these properties, FAIR researchers foresee ReSkin being used in a number of applications including in-hand manipulation, ie making sure that robot gripper doesn’t crush the egg it’s picking up; measuring tactile forces in the field, measuring how much force the human hand exerts on objects it is manipulating, and contact localization, essentially teaching robots to recognize what they’re reaching for and how much pressure to apply once they touch upon it.</p><p>As with virtually all of its earlier research, FAIR has open-sourced DIGIT, TACTO, PyTouch and ReSkin in an effort to advance the state of tactile art across the entire field.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-enabling-a-new-generation-of-touchy-feely-robots-120016974.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">14a46530-1a30-4d24-87f7-365b1d958b37</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 12:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635435194</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T15:33:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/95bffc80-3802-11ec-bdfc-f316a562d4f3" width="4896" height="3264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/95bffc80-3802-11ec-bdfc-f316a562d4f3" width="4896" height="3264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[FAIR]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[FAIR's DIGIT]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[FAIR's DIGIT]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: So what is the metaverse?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So what <em>is</em> the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a>?

They were also able to write at speeds or around a million voxels per second, or about 230 KB per second.&nbsp;</p><p>That might sound slow, but by introducing parallel writing, you could feasibly fill a 500TB disc in about 60 days. That could provide a way to backup reams of valuable data, essentially forever. &quot;With the current system, we have the ability to preserve terabytes of data, which could be used, for example, to preserve information from a person’s DNA,&quot; said research team leader Peter G. Kazansky.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/5-d-storage-could-fit-500-tb-on-cd-sized-disc-095039455.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03096616-3ca1-4cad-a66a-41f5f4c36fed</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 09:50:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635769529</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T12:25:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/530e3000-3af5-11ec-b79d-a42610881822" width="1936" height="1243" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/530e3000-3af5-11ec-b79d-a42610881822" width="1936" height="1243" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Optica]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized glass disc]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized glass disc]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's Nest devices are on sale at Best Buy ahead of Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to score Google&#39;s Nest devices at a discount before Black Friday arrives, check out Best Buy&#39;s sale — some of them are even available for the lowest price we&#39;ve seen them sell for across retailers.

In a <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/10/update-recent-service-outage/">blog post</a> published over the weekend, the studio attributed the incident to a combination of factors that involved a hard-to-identify bug.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>This was an especially difficult outage in that it involved a combination of several factors. A core system in our infrastructure became overwhelmed, prompted by a subtle bug in our backend service communications while under heavy load. This was not due to any peak in external traffic or any particular experience. Rather the failure was caused by the growth in the number of servers in our datacenters. The result was that most services at Roblox were unable to effectively communicate and deploy.</p></blockquote><p>The difficulty the company had in identifying the glitch was what took so long for a fix to come through. Once it&#39;s done a full analysis of what happened, it plans to publish a post-mortem that will include measures it plans to take to avoid similar outages in the future. &quot;We are sorry for the length of time it took us to restore service, and are deeply grateful for the patience and support of Roblox’s player, developer, and partner community,&quot; a spokesperson for the company told Engadget.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roblox-outage-ends-210646994.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5d4408b-0435-4bf4-b0d5-b4ae88e611bf</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 21:06:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635783422</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T16:17:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/20c390d0-3a8d-11ec-971c-5fd7820cadbd" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/20c390d0-3a8d-11ec-971c-5fd7820cadbd" width="3888" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/10/05: In this photo illustration a Roblox logo of an online game platform is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen.

Astronomers using NASA&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-07-spinning-black-holes-nasa.html">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> have <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/chandra-sees-evidence-for-possible-planet-in-another-galaxy.html">detected</a> what might be the first signs of a planet in another galaxy.  The team noticed dips in X-ray brightness that hint at a planet transiting in front of a star in the Messier 51 (aka M51) galaxy 28 million light-years away. For context, all the exoplanet candidates in the Milky Way are no more than 3,000 light-years from Earth — this planet would easily set a distance record if confirmed.</p><p>The very nature of stars made the feat possible. As the researchers had to focus on X-ray bright binary systems where the region of bright rays is relatively tiny, the transit was considerably easier to spot. Conventional detection of nearby stars requires much more sensitive light detection, as a planet might only block a small amount of light from a given star.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The planet itself is believed to be as large as Saturn, but would orbit its hosts (a star 20 times the mass of the Sun as well as a black hole or neutron star) at twice the distance.</p><p>Scientists didn&#39;t believe the dimming was due to gas clouds or dust, as those aren&#39;t consistent with the event they recorded in M51. A planet, however, would line up with the data.</p><p>The challenge, as you might guess, is verifying that data. The planet&#39;s large orbit could rule out another transit for roughly 70 years, and it wouldn&#39;t be clear exactly when astronomers would have to take a look. The three-hour transit of this planet candidate didn&#39;t provide a large window. That&#39;s also assuming the &#39;living&#39; star doesn&#39;t explode and bathe the planet in radiation.</p><p>If there&#39;s ever a confirmation, though, the discovery would be very significant. While there aren&#39;t many doubts that planets exist in other galaxies, it would be useful to have evidence of their existence. This could also significantly widen the scope of future planetary searches to include the galactic neighborhood, not just close-by stars.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/planet-outside-milky-way-galaxy-chandra-205310684.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0673993b-d822-47af-ae62-338999d414c1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 20:53:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635769549</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T12:26:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/912df6a0-3a86-11ec-b9fd-2227fc5ea543" width="1920" height="911" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/912df6a0-3a86-11ec-b9fd-2227fc5ea543" width="1920" height="911" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[X-ray: NASA/CXC/SAO/R.

Unlike the current 13.3-inch system, though, you wouldn&#39;t have to flip your machine around to use an e-paper display on the back. Instead, you&#39;d have a pen-capable color display next to the keyboard you could use to draw or take handwritten notes.</p><p>Blass didn&#39;t share other details, but the 17-inch ThinkBook Plus would seemingly have an extra-wide main display and fit in a full keyboard along with a large trackpad.

Either way, the image suggests Lenovo hasn&#39;t given up on the Plus concept — if anything, it&#39;s exploring new concepts that might prove appealing for creatives and others who shied away in the past.</p><div id="f23aa06029144e818d588baf04b16d90"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have you guys seen this yet? 17-inch ThinkBook Plus from Lenovo... <a href="https://t.co/OElc5ZM3pb">pic.twitter.com/OElc5ZM3pb</a></p>— Ev (@evleaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1454872863572365321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-17-inch-thinkbook-plus-leak-195551383.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1936b642-ced3-488f-b8a0-16707de71129</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 19:55:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635710155</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T19:56:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d3169460-3a80-11ec-aedf-faa457db659a" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d3169460-3a80-11ec-aedf-faa457db659a" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Evan Blass, Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lenovo 17-inch ThinkBook Plus leak]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo 17-inch ThinkBook Plus leak]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[G20 deal raises the minimum tax rate for big tech companies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Large tech companies may soon have to pay significant taxes no matter what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-30-eu-commission-apple-tax-ireland.html">tax loopholes</a> they had before. <em>BBC News</em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59101218">reports</a> G20 leaders have reached an agreement that would set a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent for large companies. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-09-g20-discuss-big-tech-tax-reform.html">long-in-the-making</a> deal should be official as of today (October 31st) and would be enforced starting in 2023.</p><p>The US originally pitched the concept to prevent companies from using creative accounting (such as the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement">Double Irish arrangement</a>&quot;) to avoid paying most of their taxes in the country. Other countries <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-22-germany-global-minimum-tax-large-tech-companies.html">embraced the idea</a>, though, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/oecd-head-defends-tax-deal-1.6232027">told</a><em>CBC News</em> the move could rake in about $150 billion from corporations around the world.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The deal could discourage tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Netflix from relying on loopholes to maximize their profits. If the deal collects the promised money, governments could better fund public services and help tackle problems like climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous criticisms, however, and not just from those who generally oppose higher taxes. Oxfam, for instance, <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/oxfam-criticizes-lack-g20-bold-action-tackle-vaccine-inequality-climate-change-and">blasted</a> &quot;generous carve outs&quot; that protected sone income and take 10 years to phase out. The pro-equality group also claimed the deal was &quot;extremely limited&quot; and would affect fewer than 100 companies while generating little money for poorer countries. The arrangement might beat the status quo for G20 nations, but it won&#39;t necessarily address some outstanding concerns.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/g20-global-minimum-tax-rate-180620093.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9e8e845-fc60-4dc9-9ce0-8e0d2851aae5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 18:06:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635769599</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T12:26:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/47b09b20-3a6f-11ec-abdf-83e1da39acf5" width="8640" height="5760" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/47b09b20-3a6f-11ec-abdf-83e1da39acf5" width="8640" height="5760" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pool via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ROME, ITALY - OCTOBER 30: U.S. President Joe Biden, Democratic Republic of Congo's President and African Union Chair Felix Tshisekedi, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, from row from left, pose with other world leaders for a group photo at the La Nuvola conference center for the G20 summit on October 30, 2021 in Rome, Italy. The G20 (or Group of Twenty) is an intergovernmental forum comprising 19 countries plus the European Union.  It was founded in 1999 in response to several world economic crises. Italy currently holds the Presidency of the G20 and this year's summit will focus on three broad, interconnected pillars of action: People, Planet, Prosperity.
