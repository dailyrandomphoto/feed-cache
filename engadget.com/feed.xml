The chipmaker promised to fix the bugs, and now AMD and Microsoft have issued patches that should do just that.</p><p>The latest chipset driver (version 3.10.08.506) should take care of the UEFI CPPC2 issue, which in some cases didn&#39;t &quot;preferentially schedule threads on a processor’s fastest core,&quot; <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400"><ins>AMD said</ins></a>. That could have slowed down apps that are sensitive to CPU thread performance. AMD noted that the problem was likely more noticeable in more powerful processors with more than eight cores and 65W or higher Thermal Design Power (TDP).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft is rolling out a software update tackling a bug that increased L3 cache latency. The issue impacted apps that need quick memory access, which in turn caused CPUs to slow down by up to 15 percent. The patch, Windows 11 update KB5006746, will be available starting today, but at the time of writing, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/KB5006746"><ins>a page containing instructions</ins></a> for installing it isn&#39;t yet live.

Sure, you can buy gaming headsets and gaming mice and gaming keyboards, but there are also gamer hoodies and gamer drinks and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-pre-order-shipping-145328930.html">gamer furniture</a>. Chairs made especially for playing have been proliferating over the past few years and until now, they’ve tended to be overpriced and ostentatious. Razer’s new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Enki chair" href="https://fave.co/2XyeIpM">Enki chair</a> is still a bit over the top, but at least it’s a more affordable over the top, starting at $299.</p><p>To build the Enki, Razer called in ergonomics experts, paying attention not just to lumbar support, but also to how test subjects sat on the bottom cushion. The 21-inch-wide seat is shaped to distribute your weight more evenly, so you can sit for hours without getting a sore ass. They even considered the needs of those who like to sit in more unusual positions, like a half- or full-lotus. As someone who often sits cross-legged in my chair, I am grateful for the extra space and support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="7f9ca757-9509-45dd-8f32-eb68174ade44"/><p>Perhaps the most impressive thing about the chair is how far back it can lean. It’s not quite 180 degrees, but 152 degrees is still pretty good — the kind of angle you might only see on an airliner’s international business class. It’s the kind of chair you can fall asleep in. It seems precarious but in use, the chair held my weight well when I opened it to its max. It didn’t feel too top heavy, like it would fall backward, but it felt a bit unnatural due to the lack of a footrest. But let’s be honest, you really should just retire to your couch or bed when you need a proper snooze. This is good for when you need a bit of a stretch between <em>Overwatch</em> matches or Zoom meetings.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eeacfe00-31e1-11ec-bfdb-706099ddf858" alt="Razer Enki from rear" data-uuid="19d9c932-54a4-33b1-9041-09aa588bb812"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>My one nitpick besides the lack of a footrest is the head pillow, which is only included with a more expensive $399 package. It’s a nice shape and the fabric feels good to the touch, but it’s also not very adjustable. It has to be strapped on around the moon-shaped cut out toward the top of the seat, which means the height is non-negotiable. I found it ended up in that limbo between my head and neck, where it just jutted out and supported neither of them. I found it incredibly uncomfortable and ended up tearing it off. However, it also felt weird to not have something supporting my head in this chair. I can only hope that Razer ends up offering more options for users of different heights.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/02d87480-31e3-11ec-aed6-4e84b5fdd520" alt="The headrest on the Razer Enki, it sucks" data-uuid="ff81871e-53ff-32b2-8481-b101f26ae5a3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Aside from that, it’s a very <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:good chair" href="https://fave.co/2XyeIpM">good chair</a> offered at a very good price — other chairs from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/minecraft-gaming-chair-secretlab-173058454.html">Secretlab</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-herman-miller-embody-gaming-chair-130000054.html">Logitech</a> might cost hundreds more, and a good non-gaming office chair can easily go above $1,000. And, while some might find it silly to buy a “gaming” chair, there’s no rule this has to be used only for gaming. You can use the chair for work, meetings and anything else. It’s not gaudy in any way that would draw attention on a video call, as Razer eschewed its usual use of lime green highlights.</p><p>In the end, it’s just a chair. A nice, comfortable chair that you can buy <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Razer;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Razer Enki" href="https://fave.co/2XyeIpM">directly from Razer</a> or various retailers starting today, for $299 for the Enki X or the $399 Enki that includes the head pillow, a more reactive seat tilt and an armrest adjustable in four directions. With all the time you’ve been spending in front of the computer lately, you should make it a little nicer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-enki-gaming-chair-hands-head-butt-on-180019360.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">08f06959-af9e-4ae4-bdb7-44bf90c7823d</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 18:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634840101</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T18:15:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c15a2e20-31e4-11ec-9f77-3db2c637cd75" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c15a2e20-31e4-11ec-9f77-3db2c637cd75" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Razer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Product image of Enki in a room with a gaming desktop, guitar and couch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer Enki]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Among Us' will hit Xbox and PlayStation on December 14th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Innersloth has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/among-us-xbox-2021-210714582.html"><ins>promising</ins></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/among-us-ps4-ps5-2021-exclusive-skin-213304316.html"><ins>for months</ins></a> that it will bring <em>Among Us </em>to Xbox and PlayStation sometime this year.

If you need a refresher, Matter was known as Project CHIP, or Connected Home over IP, before a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chip-rebrand-matter-221410229.html"><ins>rebranding this past May</ins></a>. It’s a pact between some of the biggest companies in tech, including Google, Amazon and Apple, that aims to bring standardization to the fragmented smart home space. When it launches in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-delayed-164447784.html"><ins>first half of 2022</ins></a>, it will support a variety of voice assistants and networking protocols, including Alexa, Google Assistant, Siri as well as WiFi, Thread and Bluetooth LE.</p><p>At its simplest, the promise of Matter is that you’ll be able to buy a new device and it will simply work with your existing smart home setup. To support that vision, Google is introducing new tools to help developers build and integrate Matter devices into its wider smart home ecosystem. It starts with a new but familiar name for the company’s smart home devices and developer platform: Google Home. “By bringing our platform and tools under the same roof, it gives us a simpler way to show you why and how integrating your devices with Google Home makes them more accessible and helpful across the Google ecosystem,” the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of the rebranding, will launch a redesigned Developer Center early next year. It says the dashboard will include everything developers need to build devices and applications that work with the wider Google Home ecosystem. It will support Matter at launch and Google will release two software development kits. The first of those is a Google Home Device SDK. The company says it will be one of the fastest ways to create Matter devices. Google also plans to update Nest and Android devices to support the protocol, a move it says will enable the seamless setup of Matter devices on those platforms. Once it rolls out the update, Google claims the process of adding a new smart home will be as easy as connecting a new set of headphones. One of the other ways the company hopes to support developers is by allowing them to create their own suggested routines.</p><p>For Google, the motive for doing all of this is straightforward. The easier it can make it for third-party developers to integrate their devices and applications with Google Home, the better experience consumers will find. In turn, they’ll be more likely to invest in the company’s ecosystem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-home-matter-developer-center-170049360.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">300a2bf6-ddac-49ef-92fe-ca60b3c4bb7a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 17:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634833932</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T16:32:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f7484de0-fd1a-11eb-8eb4-4d8ac557fa35" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f7484de0-fd1a-11eb-8eb4-4d8ac557fa35" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Connectivity Standards Alliance]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Matter smart home devices]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Matter smart home devices]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google starts licensing Stadia tech to other companies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-game-studios-shut-down-montreal-los-angeles-201811811.html"><ins>shut down</ins></a> its internal <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/stadia"><ins>Stadia</ins></a> game development studios earlier this year, Stadia general manager Phil Harrison said the company planned to &quot;work with partners seeking a gaming solution all built on Stadia’s advanced technical infrastructure and platform tools.&quot; We&#39;re starting to see that strategy in action, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> is now licensing Stadia tech to other companies.</p><p>As first reported by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/20/batman-arkham-knight-white-label-stadia-att/"><em><ins>9to5 Google</ins></em></a> and confirmed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/google-stadia-white-label-arkham-knight-free"><em><ins>IGN</ins></em></a>, AT&amp;T is using the tech to offer wireless subscribers the chance to stream<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-23-batman-arkham-knight-never-feels-too-big-to-play.html"><em><ins>Batman: Arkham Knight</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>(which isn&#39;t available on Stadia proper) for free.

Seagate has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/21/new-seagate-storage-expansion-cards/">introduced</a> a 2TB Storage Expansion Card that, for the Series X, effectively triples the capacity for next-gen games. It will cost $400 when it arrives in early December — nearly as much as the console itself — but might be worthwhile if you bristle at the thought of deleting games to make space.</p><p>There&#39;s also an option for those who need just a slight bump.

As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">with the PlayStation 5</a>, the Xbox Series X/S requires external storage as fast as the built-in SSD if you&#39;re going to run the latest games.

It won&#39;t be surprising if prices drop as the costs of the technology come down, but that might not happen for a while yet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/seagateo-2tb-storage-expansion-card-xbox-series-x-s-152738919.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e660e8c-2b6a-4b9c-aab5-885da485de4c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 15:27:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634830061</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T15:27:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Venture Capital]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/68acd220-327d-11ec-bfe3-34b7bbc0dbc1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/68acd220-327d-11ec-bfe3-34b7bbc0dbc1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Seagate/Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Seagate 512GB 1TB and 2TB Storage Expansion Card options for Xbox Series X and S]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Seagate 512GB 1TB and 2TB Storage Expansion Card options for Xbox Series X and S]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft and AMD will give away a 'Halo Infinite' Radeon RX 6900 XT GPU]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Beyond a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-xbox-series-x-console-elite-series-2-controller-190258414.html"><ins>special-edition Xbox Series X and controller</ins></a>, there&#39;s more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/halo%20infinite/"><em><ins>Halo Infinite</ins></em></a>-themed hardware on the way, this time for PC players.

But the process of making steel is a significant contributor to global warming and climate change. In 2018, <a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/metals-and-mining/our-insights/decarbonization-challenge-for-steel">reportedly every ton of steel produced</a> generated 1.85 tons of carbon dioxide, accounting for about 7 percent of global CO2 emissions that year. This poses not just environmental challenges for our ever increasing world, it could also impact steel producers’ bottom line, which is why the industry is developing a “fossil-free” means of making the alloy, one that relies on renewable-sourced hydrogen rather than carbon coke.</p><p>Steel is an alloy composed of iron, which in its pure form is relatively soft, with a small amount of introduced carbon, usually about 2 percent of its total weight. This improves the material’s strength and reduces its propensity for fracturing. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/how-is-steel-made-blast-furnace-2017-11">The process starts by combining iron ore</a>, before coking coal and limestone (which remove impurities) in a <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/blast-furnace">blast furnace</a> to create pig iron.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That molten pig iron is then poured into a<a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/basic-oxygen-furnace"> furnace</a> and high pressure air is introduced via a water-cooled lance. The oxygen chemically reacts with the molten iron to purge impurities — as well as produce significant amounts of carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide. The oxygen also forces impurities like silicates and phosphates present in the pig iron to react with limestone flux, trapping them as waste slag. Today, <a href="http://v/">per the World Steel Association</a>, some 1,864 million metric tons of crude steel are produced annually with China producing a vast majority of it.</p><p>While the WSA points out that “<a href="https://www.worldsteel.org/en/dam/jcr:c4532192-07eb-43ba-955c-cec8aead6763/Climate+Change+Position+Paper+FINAL+WEB.pdf">in the last 50 years</a>, the steel industry has reduced its energy consumption per tonne of steel produced by 60 percent” and notes that steel is infinitely reusable, and that “new” steel typically contain 30percent recycled steel on average the traditional methods of iron and steel production are becoming untenable — at least if we want to mitigate its impacts on climate change. What’s more, the International Energy Agency <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/iron-and-steel-technology-roadmap">estimates that global steel production</a> will grow by a third by 2050, which will only compound the industry’s environmental impacts. That’s where fossil-free steel comes in.</p><p>Take HYBRIT (Hydrogen Breakthrough Ironmaking Technology), for example. This process has been developed as a joint venture between three Swedish companies: SSAB, which makes steel, energy company Vattenfall, and LKAB, which mines iron ore. Rather than using coking coal and a blast furnace to convert raw iron ore into metallic iron, the HYBRIT method uses hydrogen generated from renewable energy sources and a technique known as direct reduction, which lowers the amount of oxygen contained within the ore without heating it above the metal’s melting point, to create <a href="https://www.metallics.org/dri.html">sponge iron</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f2d16740-31c9-11ec-bfff-6b4a44bb5ac5" alt="Blast Furnaces vs HYBRIT" data-uuid="d6a96ff4-5068-3a7e-a810-82fac00c650b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HYBRIT</div></figure><p>Like pig iron, sponge iron is an intermediary material in the steelmaking process (it’ll get shipped off to SSAB to be turned into steel slabs), but in HYBRIT’s case, its production results in the creation of water vapor rather than carbon dioxide.</p><p>“The first fossil-free steel in the world is not only a breakthrough for SSAB, it represents proof that it’s possible to make the transition and significantly reduce the global carbon footprint of the steel industry,” Martin Lindqvist, CEO of SSAB, told reporters in August. “We hope that this will inspire others to also want to speed up the green transition.”</p><p>The HYBRIT coalition opened a pilot direct reduction plant in Luleå, Sweden last year and has announced plans to <a href="https://www.hybritdevelopment.se/en/a-fossil-free-future/">increase production to an industrial scale by 2026</a>. The team claims that eliminating fossil fuels from the steelmaking industry in Sweden could drop the country’s total CO2 emissions <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2021/08/19/how-sweden-delivered-the-worlds-first-fossil-fuel-free-steel/?sh=4b9f51576b55">by at least 10 percent</a>. However, they are not the only group looking into fossil-free steel production. The H2 Green Steel company <a href="https://www.h2greensteel.com/about-us">has announced its intent</a> to open a large-scale plant in northern Sweden by 2024 and expects to produce 5 million tonnes of the material annually by 2030.</p><p>In June, <a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/282789/volvo-cars-is-first-car-maker-to-explore-fossil-free-steel-with-ssab">Volvo announced</a> that it would be partnering with SSAB to develop fossil-free steel for use in its products — both passenger cars and industrial machines. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-first-vehicle-fossil-free-steel-055542393.html">Last week</a>, Volvo unveiled the first vehicle to be made with fossil-free steel, an <a href="https://www.ssab.com/news/2021/10/ssabs-fossilfree-steel-featured-in-volvo-groups-vehicle">8-plus ton load carrier</a> designed to operate within mines. Not only is the load carrier powered by a fully electric drivetrain, it can autonomously navigate across a worksite as well. Granted only about 3 of the vehicle’s 8 tons were made from fossil-free steel (the drivetrain’s steel components, for example, were made through traditional smelting means), this marks an important first step towards a carbon-neutral transportation future.</p><p>“When we have been talking about ‘fossil free’ in the transport sector, we have been focusing a lot on emissions from the vehicles in use. But it&#39;s clear to us and to everyone else that we also need to address the carbon footprint from the production of our vehicles,” Volvo Group’s Chief Technology Officer Lars Stenqvist told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2021/10/13/this-is-the-worlds-first-fossil-free-steel-vehicle-autonomous-electric-and-a-volvo/?sh=3a3d97f97a68"><em>Forbes</em></a>. “That&#39;s why it&#39;s so important now to team up with everyone in the value chain and collaborate in order to drive out all the fossil fuel also used in the production of components, parts and also running our production facilities.”</p><p>Volvo expects the autonomous load carriers to enter real-world operation by next year, though the company concedes that its ability to ramp up production of fossil-free vehicles will depend largely on SSAB’s ability to deliver sufficient quantities of the material.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/we-can-make-the-steel-of-tomorrow-without-the-fossil-fuels-of-yesteryear-150050946.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af439040-1e03-42b9-9f45-cf72e5a8cd67</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 15:00:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634829035</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T15:10:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Basic Materials Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e6605b80-3280-11ec-bbb9-26feb1ee7632" width="5000" height="3155" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e6605b80-3280-11ec-bbb9-26feb1ee7632" width="5000" height="3155" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SAFIN HAMED via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Iraqi steelworkers and a forge.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[1229191270 Iraqi steelworkers / forge]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Polestar gives owners two years of free fast charging from Electrify America]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t have to pay for quick <a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-polestar-the-twos-are-anything-but-terrible-130059155.html">Polestar 2</a> charges — at least, not for a while.

Luckily, there’s never been more choice, and we’ve seen vast improvements in color accuracy, size and resolution since our last update.</p><p>It’s great to have lots of choice, but it can also make your buying decision a challenge. For example, do you need HDR, and if so, how bright should your monitor be? How important is color accuracy, refresh rates and input lag? What size do you need? Should it be curved or straight?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Luckily, we’ve done the research and can help you figure all that out depending on your specific needs and, most importantly, budget. Read on to see exactly what to look for in a monitor and which makes and models to choose.</p><iframe src="https://delivery.vidible.tv/htmlembed/pid=5706c5c8e4b03b51471aefba/564f3144ff690c0a7c285e51.html?vid=5ea668f1a2a07d2be27d22a8" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><h2>The basics</h2><h3>Screen size, resolution and display format</h3><p>In this day and age, screen size rules. Where 24-inch displays used to be more or less standard (and can still be useful for basic computing), 27-, 32-, 34- and even 42-inch displays have become popular for entertainment, content creation and even gaming these days.</p><p>Nearly every monitor used to be 16:9, but it’s now possible to find 16:10 and other more exotic display shapes. On the gaming and entertainment side, we’re also seeing very wide and curved monitors with aspect ratios like 21:9. If you do decide to buy an ultrawide display, however, keep in mind that a 30-inch 21:9 model is the same height as a 24-inch monitor, so you might end up with a smaller display than you expected. As a rule of thumb, add 25 percent to the size of a 21:9 monitor to get the size you need.</p><p>4K is nearly a must for content creators, and some folks are even going for 5K or all the way up to 8K. Keep in mind, though, that you’ll need a pretty powerful computer to drive all those pixels. And 4K should be paired with a screen size of 27 inches and up, or you won’t notice much difference between 1440p. At the same time, I wouldn’t get a model larger than 27 inches unless it’s 4K, as you’ll start to see pixelation if you’re working up close to the display.</p><p>One new category to consider is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-27-asus-240hz-portable-monitor-for-gamers-hands-on.html">portable monitors</a> designed to be carried and used with laptops. Those typically come in 1080p resolutions and sizes from 13-15 inches. They usually have a lightweight kickstand-type support that folds up to keep things compact.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>HDR</h3><p>HDR is the buzzy monitor feature to have these days, but be careful before jumping in. Some monitors that claim HDR on the marketing materials don’t even conform to a base standard. To be sure that a display at least meets minimum HDR specs, you’ll want to choose one with a DisplayHDR rating with each tier representing maximum brightness in nits.</p><p>However, the lowest DisplayHDR 400 and 500 tiers may disappoint you with a lack of brightness, washed out blacks and mediocre color reproduction.If you can afford it, choose a model with DisplayHDR 600, 1000 or True Black 400, True Black 500 and True Black 600. The True Black settings are designed primarily for OLED models, with maximum black levels at .0005 nits.</p><p>Where televisions typically offer HDR10 and Dolby Vision or HDR10+, most PC monitors only support the HDR10 standard, other than a few (very expensive) models. That doesn’t matter much for content creation or gaming, but HDR streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and other services won’t look quite as punchy.&nbsp;</p><h3>Refresh rate</h3><p>Refresh rate is a key feature, particularly on gaming monitors. A bare minimum nowadays is 60Hz, and 80Hz refresh rates and up are much easier on the eyes. However, most 4K displays top out at 60Hz with some rare exceptions and the HDMI 2.0 spec only supports 4K at 60Hz, so you’d need at least DisplayPort 1.4 (4K at 120Hz) or HDMI 2.1. The latter is now available on a number of monitors, particularly gaming displays. However, it’s only supported on the latest NVIDIA RTX 3000- and AMD RX 6000-series GPUs and requires a very powerful PC.</p><h3>Inputs</h3><p>There are essentially three types of modern display inputs: Thunderbolt, DisplayPort and HDMI. Most monitors built for PCs come with the latter two, while a select few (typically built for Macs) will use Thunderbolt. To add to the confusion, USB-C ports may be Thunderbolt 3 and by extension, DisplayPort compatible, so you may need a USB-C to Thunderbolt or DisplayPort cable adapter depending on your display.</p><h3>Panel type</h3><p>The cheapest monitors are still TN (twisted nematic), which are strictly for gaming or office use. VA (vertical alignment) monitors are also relatively cheap, while offering good brightness and high contrast ratios. However, content creators will probably want an IPS (in-plane switching) LCD display that delivers better color accuracy, image quality and viewing angles.</p><p>If maximum brightness is important, a quantum dot LCD display is the way to go — those are typically found in larger displays.  OLED monitors are now available and offer the best blacks and color reproduction, but they lack the brightness of LED or quantum dot displays. Plus, they cost a lot.</p><p>The new panel on the block is MiniLED. It’s similar to quantum dot tech, but as the name suggests, it uses smaller LED diodes that are just 0.2mm in diameter. As such, manufacturers can pack in up to three times more LEDs with more local dimming zones, delivering deeper blacks and better contrast.&nbsp;</p><h3>Color bit depth</h3><p>Serious content content creators should consider a more costly 10-bit monitor that can display billions of colors. If budget is an issue, you can go for an 8-bit panel that can fake billions of colors via dithering (often spec’d as “8-bit + FRC”). For entertainment or business purposes, a regular 8-bit monitor that can display millions of colors will be fine.</p><h3>Color gamut</h3><p>The other aspect of color is the gamut. That expresses the range of colors that can be reproduced and not just the number of colors. Most good monitors these days can cover the sRGB and Rec.709 gamuts (designed for photos and video respectively). For more demanding work, though, you’ll want one that can reproduce more demanding modern gamuts like AdobeRGB, DCI-P3 and Rec.2020 gamuts, which encompass a wider range of colors. The latter two are often used for film projection and HDR, respectively.&nbsp;</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h2></h2><h2>Best monitor around $200</h2><h3>Acer KG241Q</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/55c5a3d0-326e-11ec-bf3b-372766298d5f" alt="Acer KG241Q monitor" data-uuid="5b587be7-7c4d-39d7-9033-be8fa41472ef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Acer</div></figure><p>Whether you need a monitor for gaming, entertainment or work, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Acer&#x002019;s 24-inch KG241Q" href="https://fave.co/2XnUAXx">Acer’s 24-inch KG241Q</a> offers a lot of value.

However, it doesn&#39;t offer the stacked chip-on-sensor technology of the A1 and A9/A9 II, so it lacks the sensor readout speeds of those models.&nbsp;</p><p>As such, the A7 IV is limited to the same 10 fps shootings speeds as the A7 III, both with the mechanical and electronic shutter — whereas the A1 can shoot at triple that speed. However, the A7 III was limited to around 90 RAW frames at a time, but the A7 IV can shoot an incredible 828 uncompressed RAW+JPEG images in a burst, provided you capture to a CFexpress Type A card.</p><p>Powered by the A1&#39;s BIONZ R processing engine, it offers the same 759 phase-detect AF points as the A1 with around 94 percent sensor coverage. It also comes with the same AI-powered image tracking that can process spatial information &quot;in real time at high speed,&quot; Sony said. That means more tenacious tracking, along with faster and more accurate eye AF for humans, animals and birds.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7a025e90-3279-11ec-bdb7-348b5f1f74b3" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Sony&#39;s A7 IV camera arrives with a 33-megapixel sensor and 4K 60p video " data-uuid="7b47ed90-69a4-3a8e-a381-a20160170f30"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Perhaps the biggest improvements with the A7 IV are on with video. Where the A7 III was limited to 4K/30p with 8 bits of color depth, the A7 IV can handle 4K at up to 60 fps with 10 bit, 4:22 All-I capture — putting it on par with Canon&#39;s EOS R6 and the Panasonic GH5 II. 4K 30fps is super-sampled using the entire 7K width of the sensor, while 4K/60p uses a 4.6K Super35 1.5X crop. That means there&#39;s no pixel binning, so video should be very sharp.&nbsp;</p><p>It supports a number of video file types, including XAVC S All-I at up to 600 Mbps for 4K/60 10-bit, 4:2:2 movies. All of the video modes, except one S&amp;Q setting that requires CFexpress Type A, can be captured to an SD UHS II card. However, unlike the A1 and A7S III, there&#39;s no support for 16-bit RAW video capture to an external recorder. RAW video isn&#39;t found on the EOS R6 either, but is available on Panasonic&#39;s $1,800<a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5s-firmware-prores-raw-140000967.html"> GH5s</a> and the $2,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikons-latest-z-6-ii-firmware-unlocks-4-k-60-fps-recording-110552464.html">Nikon Z6 II</a>, via recorders from Atomos and Blackmagic Design.</p><div id="f7979042d93b446299bc509e368e5810"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zerSHqKWhYQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Video autofocus is improved with faster and more accurate tracking, and the A7 IV is Sony&#39;s first camera to support both human and animal/bird eye tracking for video. If the A7 IV&#39;s AF works nearly as well as the A7S III, it should be nearly on par with Canon&#39;s Dual Pixel AF.</p><p>What about overheating, the EOS R6&#39;s primary bugbear? With a heat-dissipating body structure, the A7 IV can record 4K 60p 10-bit 4:2:2 video continuously for more than an hour, Sony claims. The R6, meanwhile, is limited to around 40 minutes at 4K/30p before a cooling off period is required.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7a8813e0-327a-11ec-8654-9b08d53bf242" style="height:1890;width:2000;" alt="Sony&#39;s A7 IV camera arrives with a 33-megapixel sensor and 4K 60p video" data-uuid="9f8f4fe4-208c-35ef-b219-21ab8cc90137"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>With most camera lenses, pulling video focus from a foreground to background subject can cause an ugly change in framing. The A7 IV&#39;s Focus Breathing Compensation system essentially uses a digital zoom to compensate for that, making the transition smoother. However, since the system needs to track lens elements, it only supports Sony-branded glass — and only the rather expensive G and GM models, at that.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;d rather focus manually, the A7 IV is debuting a new feature called Focus Map. It overlays colors onto a scene showing the parts within, behind and in front of the depth of field (DOF). That&#39;s supposed to help you pull focus quickly and in the right direction toward your subject. Related to that is the new &quot;AF Assist&quot; function borrowed from Sony&#39;s FX6 cinema camera that allows for manual focus, even during autofocus operation.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a5fd90e0-327a-11ec-bebf-ff683a4ee016" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Sony&#39;s A7 IV camera arrives with a 33-megapixel sensor and 4K 60p video             " data-uuid="ed94d4c0-2af3-31eb-a670-114df9b0370e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Lastly, Sony has introduced new live streaming and sharing features, though they&#39;re not quite up to the level we&#39;ve seen on other recent cameras. If you use Sony&#39;s Imaging Edge mobile app, it will now use Bluetooth to maintain a continuous connection, rather than disconnecting as before.&nbsp;</p><p>It also offers faster transfer speeds with 5GHz WiFi and superspeed USB-C 3.2 Gen2 (10Gbps). You can do video and audio streaming over USB-C at up to 1080p 60 or 4K 15p if resolution is a priority over smooth video. That allows for webcam or livestreaming via apps like OBS with digital audio and effects like soft skin. The camera can also record internally while you&#39;re live streaming, providing a backup. Unlike Panasonic&#39;s GH5 II however, you can&#39;t transmit via RTMP to Twitch, YouTube or other services without a phone or laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>The A7 IV is clearly a massive leap forward for Sony&#39;s &quot;basic&quot; full-frame mirrorless camera series, putting it on par or ahead of most rivals. The only deterrent is the $2,500 price tag ($2,699 with a 28-70mm f/3.5-5.6 OSS kit lens), which is $500 more than the A7 III cost at launch. I&#39;d wager, though, that it&#39;s going to be just as popular as the original, provided it delivers the promised performance — so stay tuned for our review. The A7 IV is set to arrive by the end of December 2021.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-camera-arrives-with-a-33-megapixel-sensor-and-4k-60p-video-141301936.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4857c28a-4adf-443b-9265-99a14a35cc7c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 14:13:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634827095</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T14:40:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a8da35e0-3278-11ec-9fdf-0f49002706df" width="1852" height="1114" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a8da35e0-3278-11ec-9fdf-0f49002706df" width="1852" height="1114" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony's A7 IV camera arrives with a 33-megapixel sensor and 4K 60p video]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony's A7 IV camera arrives with a 33-megapixel sensor and 4K 60p video]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Uncharted’ movie trailer plays Nathan Drake's greatest hits]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony is finally releasing an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/uncharted/"><em>Uncharted</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>movie after trying to make one for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-10-02-avi-arad-producing-uncharted-drakes-fortune-film.html">over a decade</a>. If you need more evidence that the film actually exists beyond a snap of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-movie-tom-holland-nathan-drake-first-look-155151891.html">Tom Holland in Nathan Drake&#39;s classic attire</a>, here&#39;s the first trailer.</p><p>Even though Holland plays <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-22-uncharted-prequel-tom-holland.html">a much younger version</a> of the character (which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-mark-wahlberg-in-uncharted-movie.html">Mark Wahlberg&#39;s Sully</a> jokes about in the opening moments) than in the games, the enjoyable-enough trailer incudes some of the most memorable moments from Drake&#39;s globe-trotting adventures. There isn&#39;t a bit where he clambers up a train carriage that&#39;s dangling over a cliff, but there&#39;s the cargo plane set piece from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-10-24-uncharted-3-drakes-deception-review.html"><em>Uncharted 3</em></a> and a ship trapped inside a cave, just like in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-05-05-uncharted-4-photo-mode-screenshot-gallery.html"><em>Uncharted 4</em></a>. The clip includes some underground exploration too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d23e0be4ee064a2cb3e36b929a13d771"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eHp3MbsCbMg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The film&#39;s set to arrive in theaters on February 18th, following several delays. Attempts to make an <em>Uncharted </em>movie stopped and started over the years, with directors including David O. Russell, Seth Gordon and Shawn Levy being attached at certain points before <em>Zombieland </em>and <em>Venom </em>helmer Ruben Fleischer saw the film through. The project had been in development for so long that, for a while, Wahlberg <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-11-24-uncharted-movie-to-star-mark-wahlberg.html">looked set to play Drake</a>, rather than the character&#39;s mentor.</p><p>Some viewers might be coming to the franchise with fresh eyes (maybe because they need more Tom Holland in their lives), and they might want to play the games to see what all the fuss is about. Sony Pictures included a handy reminder at the end of the trailer about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-4-and-uncharted-lost-legacy-are-coming-to-ps-5-and-pc-211007741.html">a remastered bundle</a> of <em>Uncharted 4</em> and <em>Uncharted: The Lost Legacy</em> that&#39;s coming to PlayStation 5 and PC in early 2022.</p><p>In case the trailer doesn&#39;t quite match up to what you might have expected, or Holland doesn&#39;t seem like the right person for the gig in your opinion, it&#39;s worth checking out this short fan film from a few years back in which Nathan Fillion plays the rogueish treasure hunter. It&#39;s a blast.</p><div id="4b34d04a3a054a8882153e0aa6bd483b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v5CZQpqF_74?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uncharted-movie-trailer-tom-holland-nathan-drake-135811981.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c671f8fe-8369-436d-8246-596afe2a837e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:58:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634832042</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T16:00:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e893b740-3275-11ec-a0ef-e9a33b8d5ffd" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e893b740-3275-11ec-a0ef-e9a33b8d5ffd" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Clay Enos]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tom Holland (Nathan Drake) and Sophia Taylor Ali (Chloe Frazer) star in Columbia Pictures' Uncharted.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tom Holland and Sophia Taylor Ali in the Uncharted movie]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Oversight Board slams Facebook’s lack of transparency in VIP moderation]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook&#39;s Oversight Board has issued a rebuke to the company in a <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/215139350722703-oversight-board-demands-more-transparency-from-facebook/">new quarterly report</a>, claiming it was not &quot;fully forthcoming&quot; about its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-cross-check-183544254.html">XCheck program</a> for VIP users. The documents shows the limits of the board&#39;s power over Facebook, but also its ability to potentially apply public pressure.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;When Facebook referred <a href="https://www.oversightboard.com/decision/FB-691QAMHJ/">the case related to former US President Trump</a> to the Board, it did not mention the cross-check system,&quot; according to the report. &quot;Given that the referral included a specific policy question about account-level enforcement for political leaders, many of whom the Board believes were covered by cross-check, this omission is not acceptable.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Oversight Board, sometimes called Facebook&#39;s &quot;Supreme Court,&quot; started issuing important rulings earlier this year. One of its first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump-suspension-ban-130251901.html">major rulings</a> was that the ban of ex-President Donald Trump was &quot;appropriate,&quot; though it said an indefinite suspension was outside of Facebook&#39;s power.</p><blockquote><p>In the Board’s view, the team within Facebook tasked with providing information has not been fully forthcoming on cross-check. On some occasions, Facebook failed to provide relevant information to the Board, while in other instances, the information it did provide was incomplete.</p></blockquote><p>Last month, the board asked Facebook to explain its controversial rules for VIPs, saying that the information was key to its Trump decision. Facebook originally told the board that the XCheck program only applied to a &quot;small number of decisions,&quot; but later admitted that statement was misleading. The board also said that Facebook provided &quot;no meaningful transparency&quot; on how it determines which accounts should be included in XCheck.&nbsp;</p><p>An investigative report last month from the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, with information coming from a whistleblower later revealed to be former Facebook employee <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety-062311634.html">Frances Haugen</a>, showed that the program has actually enabled millions of high-profile users to skirt its rules.</p><p>The report also addressed the board&#39;s own performance and whether Facebook is following its recommendations. It said it took on average 74 days to decide and implement each case, and only handled a fraction that came up. In total, it has taken on 20 important cases &quot;covering topics from hate speech to COVID-19 misinformation&quot; and ruled on 17 of them, overturning Facebook&#39;s decisions eight times. It made 52 recommendations to Facebook, which has not agreed to implement all of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook is facing a major fallout in Washington over the Frances Haugen document leak. Earlier this year, it promised to &quot;fully implement&quot; the Oversight Board&#39;s recommendations and explain the rationale, standards and review process of its VIP program.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the new report, however, Facebook is not following its own plan so far. The board, meanwhile, has been criticized for allowing Facebook to duck blame for key decisions, while having no authority to force Facebook to comply with its own decisions.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the board said that today it accepted a request from Facebook to review the XCheck program and make recommendations. Facebook is apparently looking for guidance on how to ensure fairness and objectivity, govern the program and make recommendations on how it can be changed. As part of that, the Oversight Board plans to issue a call for public comments &quot;which we will launch in the coming days.&quot;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebooks-oversight-board-said-the-company-failed-to-provide-relevant-information-132603146.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28e925b2-07de-4224-ba84-d4c10a848b50</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:26:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634823181</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T13:33:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/74baad60-71e6-11eb-aff7-53e52ef84289" width="3500" height="2137" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/74baad60-71e6-11eb-aff7-53e52ef84289" width="3500" height="2137" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Robert Galbraith / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Facebook logo is shown at Facebook headquarters in Palo Alto, California May 26, 2010.

Just make sure to familiarize yourself with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Woot&#39;s return policy" href="https://fave.co/3hQFqju">Woot&#39;s return policy</a> before picking one up.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3jiKWNx" id="a248b5aac5e14122bf312c47fc582914" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Woot;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Apple AirTag at Woot - $26</a><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> are the trackers to get if you live within the Apple ecosystem. They pair just as quickly to iOS device as AirPods do and those with newer iPhones can use Precision Finding to see when they&#39;re close to their lost items. From the Find My app, you can force the AirTag to play a chime to better direct you to your things, and if the item isn&#39;t anywhere near you, the app can show you its last known location. With Lost Mode enabled, you&#39;ll get an alert when Apple&#39;s network of devices detects the location of the AirTag in question, and you can choose to share your phone number and message — just in case someone else finds your stuff.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from the fact that AirTags will only work with Apple devices — sorry Android fans — the biggest problem with them is their lack of a keyring hole. So unless you plan on sticking the tracker in the folds of a wallet or a backpack pocket, you&#39;ll need an AirTag holder to hook it onto your keys and other items. Thankfully, you don&#39;t need to drop more than the price of the tracker itself on one of Apple&#39;s own cases; there are plenty of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">solid, affordable third-party AirTag cases</a> out there right now. Also, while an AirTag&#39;s battery should last for a year, it&#39;s wise to keep a couple of extra watch batteries on hand for when you inevitably need to replace it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtags-are-10-percent-off-at-woot-today-only-131007796.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4378543b-a2f0-49d3-9ba5-3e6a825ef20a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:10:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634821473</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T13:04:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook Messenger adds group AR effects and games to video calls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-portal-spark-ar-170048646.html">Facebook Messenger&#39;s augmented reality effects</a> are no longer limited to individuals. The social media company has introduced a Group Effects feature that, as the name implies, enables AR effects for everyone in a video call.

The service is powered by a new gaming supercomputer called the GeForce Now SuperPod and costs double the price of the current <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-nows-price-increase-new-features-180648780.html">Priority tier</a>.</p><p>The SuperPod is &quot;the most powerful gaming supercomputer ever built,&quot; according to NVIDIA, delivering 39,200 TFLOPS, 11,477, 760 CUDA Cores and 8,960 CPU Cores. NVIDIA said it will provide an experience equivalent to 35 TFLOPs, or triple the Xbox Series X, roughly equal to a PC with an 8-core CPU, 28GB of DDR4-3200 RAM and a PCI-GEN4 SSD.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9fb8f9d0-325d-11ec-bf9c-44ba371e8c1d" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="NVIDIA launches GeForce Now RTX 3080-class gaming at up to 1440p 120fps" data-uuid="44dbf143-8ef2-3271-9d6c-1ec0ca74a0a9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div></figure><p>As such, you&#39;ll see 1440p gaming at up to 120fps on a Mac or PC, and even 4K HDR on a shield, though NVIDIA didn&#39;t mention the refresh rate for the latter. It&#39;ll also support 120 fps on mobile, &quot;supporting next-gen 120Hz displays,&quot; the company said. By comparison, the GeForce Now Priority tier is limited to 1080p at 60 fps, with adaptive VSync available in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-nows-price-increase-new-features-180648780.html">latest update</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s also promising a &quot;click-to-pixel&quot; latency down to 56 milliseconds, thanks to tricks like adaptive sync that reduces buffering, supposedly beating other services and even local, dedicated PCs. However, that&#39;s based on a 15 millisecond round trip delay (RTD) to the GeForce Now data center, something that obviously depends on your internet provider and where you&#39;re located.&nbsp;</p><p>NVIDIA&#39;s claims aside, it&#39;s clearly a speed upgrade over the current GeForce Priority tier, whether you&#39;re on a mobile device or PC. There&#39;s a price to pay for that speed, though. The GeForce Now premium tier started at $50 per year and recently doubled to $100, which is already a pretty big ask. But the RTX 3080 tier is $100 for six months (around double the price) &quot;in limited quantities,&quot; with Founders and priority early access starting today. If it lives up to the claims, it&#39;s cheaper than buying a new PC, in any case.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-now-introduces-an-rtx-3080-tier-for-up-to-1440-p-120-fps-gaming-130011568.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c0efd587-f276-4580-aa27-a6cf9777422f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:00:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634814825</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T11:13:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8cd0dcf0-3255-11ec-96f6-ee9ffbbd2d0c" width="1280" height="680" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8cd0dcf0-3255-11ec-96f6-ee9ffbbd2d0c" width="1280" height="680" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA launches GeForce Now RTX 3080-class gaming at up to 1440p 120fps]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA launches GeForce Now RTX 3080-class gaming at up to 1440p 120fps]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TCL's Tab Pro 5G is a $400 tablet that connects to Verizon's mmWave network]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a few short years, the cost of 5G access has dropped dramatically. What used to be a feature you could only find on premium devices like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-25-samsung-5g-galaxy-s10-hands-on.html"><ins>Samsung S10 5G</ins></a> has made its way to phones as affordable as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html"><ins>$449 Pixel 5a</ins></a>. But we haven’t seen that trend play out the same way in the tablet space. For the most part, you still either have to pay a premium or forgo the feature altogether. Enter the TCL Tab Pro 5G, a new $400 tablet that’s exclusive to Verizon and comes with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-23-how-5g-makes-use-of-millimeter-waves.html">n260 and n261 mmWave support</a>.</p><p>Outside of the fact it can connect to a 5G network, the most intriguing aspect of the Tab Pro 5G is that it comes with an 8,000mAh battery. With TCL’s On-the-Go reverse charging, you can use the tablet as an impromptu power bank for your other devices. Powering the Tab Pro 5G alone, TCL claims you can expect about 17 hours of mixed-use battery life. Using the included 18W power adapter, it takes about four hours to charge the device to full.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe541720-31dd-11ec-bf75-93c28fb6554f" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="TCL Tab Pro 5G" data-uuid="1c07c284-4bba-3bbb-a726-911bcd2183e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p>Otherwise, the Tab Pro 5G is about what you would expect when it comes to a $400 tablet. Internally, it features a Qualcomm 480 5G chip, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. You can add up to 1TB of additional space through a micro SD card. The 10.36-inch 1,200 x 2,000 resolution display is limited to 60Hz but includes TCL’s NXTVISION technology, which allows it to convert an SDR video into an HDR one. For taking photos, it comes with a 13-megapixel main camera and an 8-megapixel selfie shooter.</p><p>The Tab Pro 5G is available to buy today from Verizon. If you purchase online, you can save $100 on the tablet through the carrier’s Buy More, Save More Promo — but that means also buying an eligible Android phone.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tcl-tab-pro-5g-annoucement-verizon-130009144.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b7c6b201-bd61-4802-921e-c6bb2228d245</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634759590</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T19:53:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cedf8010-31dd-11ec-a7dd-dd9c78b0ccd5" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cedf8010-31dd-11ec-a7dd-dd9c78b0ccd5" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TCL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TCL Tab Pro 5G]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TCL Tab Pro 5G]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surface Duo 2 review: Microsoft's second dual-screen hybrid is a letdown]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="5b611e69ef744940a6acbe70f33d82e3"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hb06S7Pjew" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Microsoft isn’t giving up on its dual-screen dreams. The company is back this year with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-hands-on-price-specs-buggy-update-triple-camera-160008199.html">a new Surface Duo</a> that looks like it might fix some of the original’s flaws. Instead of a finicky and low-quality camera, the Duo 2 packs a triple-sensor system on its rear, in addition to a selfie shooter inside. The device also has a narrower overall footprint, faster-refreshing screens and some updated software. There’s also support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-151216222.html">Microsoft’s Slim Pen 2</a>, which should make drawing and taking notes a more intuitive experience.</p><p>But despite having addressed many of the previous generation’s issues and adding some useful features, the Duo 2 remains a frustrating device. And at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,500" href="https://fave.co/3E35di8">$1,500</a>, it’s still a pricey product with a niche, limited appeal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware and design changes</h2><p>By now, you’re probably familiar with the Duo’s proposition. The second generation features a pair of 5.8-inch screens connected by a hinge. It’s also running Android 11 this year, with some tweaks to improve multi-display use. Combined, the two panels offer an 8.3-inch canvas, which is slightly bigger than before. You can flip one screen all the way around to use the Duo 2 in a phone-like single-screen state, use one side as a stand to prop up the other half or have both displays facing you like a book or tablet.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-review-software-camera-specs-130024046.html">the original</a>, this thing is an attractive piece of hardware with an impressively thin profile and a sleek silhouette. The Duo 2 is a bit heavier than its predecessor, and even heavier than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">the Galaxy Z Fold 3</a>, and I’d chalk most of that gain up to its camera module. Despite the chunky protrusion on the back of the right screen, though, the Duo 2 is evenly weighted and felt balanced when open.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/db43b120-3203-11ec-86ef-fe35c4d66ca9" alt="Side view of the Microsoft Surface Duo 2, showing its rear camera module sandwiched between the backs of its two screens. " data-uuid="91612b88-07d0-3b2a-8f19-ee4bc5c1d5e2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>My main concern when I first saw the camera bump was that two sides would no longer lay flush against each other when opened all the way up. But the bump was surprisingly unobtrusive, and while I didn’t mind using the Duo 2 as a single-screen device, it’s still a bit too wide to replace my phone, especially for one-handed use. Though the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is heavy and its screen is a little too narrow and cramped, it still offers a better experience in this mode.</p><p>When the panels are back-to-back, the system will keep the last screen you used active, while the other shows a message saying you can double tap it to switch over. It’s basically two phones sandwiching a camera and you can use one side at a time. You’ll notice odd aspect ratio issues here and there, thanks to the uncommon 1,892 x 1,344 resolution, but for the most part apps expand to cover the whole screen nicely if you enable the automatic span setting. It even worked with the notoriously finicky Instagram, except… photo captions would overflow into the edges and get eaten up, and Stories still had blank space flanking them.&nbsp;</p><p>I did appreciate the 90Hz refresh rate when scrolling through my social feeds. The AMOLED panels are lovely, delivering crisp and colorful image and video quality. I do wish they got a bit brighter, though, since they’re about 200 nits dimmer than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">the iPhone 13 series</a>.</p><p>When closed, the Duo 2 is basically useless since, unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 3, it doesn’t have an “external” screen. If you want to read your notifications while the device is laying on a table, you’ll need to leave it open or with one display facing out.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/09821220-3204-11ec-bfef-e3f51734e7b1" alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo 2&#39;s glance bar showing the time through the hinge." data-uuid="5bd856dc-8e89-3136-b20c-42d880b25b9c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>But Microsoft tries to offer you at least barebones notifications while the Duo 2 is closed via the new Glance Bar. The inside edges of the screens are curved slightly so you can see a little bit of the display through the hinge. When the Glance Bar is enabled, you can see the clock and other system info on this tiny sliver, and it’ll light up in different colors when you have incoming calls or messages. It actually drew my attention to the fact that the Duo 2 didn’t charge overnight by glowing red to indicate the battery was low.</p><p>While the Glance Bar is somewhat helpful, it’s also super tiny, which means you need to have Superman’s eyesight to see the clock from more than, say, a few inches away, which basically defeats the purpose. Plus, the Glance Bar works with just first-party apps for now, which means you’ll only get alerted to text messages and phone calls. Oh, and Teams calls, in case you’re <em>that</em> wired into Microsoft’s ecosystem.</p><h2>The best uses for the Duo 2’s dual-screens</h2><p>You can also use the Duo 2 in a few other modes (or “postures” as Microsoft calls them), thanks to the hinge, which is sturdy and smooth. It’s easy to open without too much force, yet strong enough to prop up one screen without it budging. Perhaps the best way to use the Duo 2 is in Book and Tent modes, the latter of which is wonderful for playing games while seated at a desk. It’s also handy for keeping an eye on Twitter or a YouTube live chat while working on my laptop.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/26928fc0-3204-11ec-9c3c-724c10a30936" alt="A Microsoft Surface Duo 2 with one screen propped up to face out and the other screen laying face down on a table. " data-uuid="904cde38-e3f4-37ac-ab2a-9207ed057e5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Then, when you’re ready to turn your attention to something more intensive, switch over to Book mode and hold the Duo 2 up with both displays facing you. This can be very immersive on any device, and I had a similar feeling with the Z Fold 3. It’s not ideal for idle doomscrolling while you watch TV or firing off a quick reply to your group chats, though. When you have both screens on they basically demand you be actively engaged — whether it’s reading a book, or building a shopping list on one side while looking at recipes on the other.</p><p>The Duo 2 is satisfying in this mode if you’re holding it vertically. Flip to landscape orientation and the entire UI just struggles to keep up, especially if you’re using swipe-based navigation instead of choosing the older Android home screen, with back and recent buttons. In general, the Duo 2 feels a little clumsy when held horizontally.</p><h2>Software quirks remain</h2><p>I want to commend Microsoft for all the work it’s done to improve the Duo 2’s software. Compared to the hot mess of last year’s model, the system feels a little more cohesive. Part of that has to do with better support for multi-screen devices in Android 11. But quirks still remain and they’re still too numerous for me to list individually, so I’m just going to give you a few examples.</p><p>Like I said before, the UI doesn’t know what to do with the swipe-based navigation and in landscape mode, the typical swipe up to go home gesture doesn’t work. Instead, you’ll have to swipe in from the right to either go home or see all apps. To go back, you can only swipe from the left — bad news for anyone who preferred it the other way.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4597b170-3204-11ec-b73f-a639b873239c" alt="A person holding the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 in book mode showing the Engadget home page. Images and text are eaten up by the hinge. " data-uuid="760ed4f1-78f0-3ca4-8d0e-69c4e3bb09f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Also, trying to type in this mode is still a pain — you’ll lose more than two thirds of the screen to the keyboard (and a weird row of empty space at the bottom), so good luck trying to see what you composed.</p><p>Even in Book mode there are annoying quirks. There’s a pervasive touch input issue that other reviewers noted on the original Duo and it explains why I felt the Duo 2 is sluggish and finicky. Throughout the system, whether it’s trying to switch lenses in the camera or open the settings menu in a game, the system sometimes just doesn’t register a tap. I’d need to jab at it repeatedly for something to happen.</p><p>There are other issues too, but they happen inconsistently enough that I felt like the Duo 2 was gaslighting me. For example, the Microsoft Start app would randomly launch on the left screen when I had an app on the right. I promise you this wasn’t because I accidentally swiped over to the left to see the Start feed; This is a ghost app that appears on its own. There’s also that Instagram caption overflow problem I mentioned earlier that seemed to go away, but would reappear now and then.</p><section data-eng-breakout="3291f97c5096455ca6a4d116d12bbba9" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/785e59b0-3204-11ec-b95d-3ed0d9ca610b" alt="A close up of the Microsoft Surface Duo 2&#39;s rear camera module. "></section><h2>Camera performance</h2><p>The camera was one of the most frustrating parts of the original Duo, and I was hopeful that the second generation would be vastly improved. Unfortunately, it wasn’t. To be clear, the hardware is better. You get a triple camera system with a 12-megapixel main sensor, a 12-megapixel telephoto lens and a 16-megapixel wide option with a 110-degree field of view. The selfie camera also got an upgrade, going from 11-megapixels to 12.</p><p>Photos taken by the Duo 2 <em>are</em> better. In general, pictures were rich and bright, with sharp details, though the camera struggled in low light. There’s a weird cast in some of the photos where the camera seemed to white balance the same scene differently in back-to-back shots, but that’s a minor issue that other phones face too. More disappointing is the front camera, which delivered noisy, pale shots of my friends and I, and has a tendency to overexpose everything.</p><p>The biggest problem is that the Duo 2’s camera app still sucks. I thought that with a dedicated rear and front camera setup, the system would no longer have to guess what screen you wanted to use as a viewfinder. But instead of letting users decide which cameras they want to use at any time, Microsoft limits when you can use the rear cameras. If you unfold the Duo 2 so that the screens are more than 180 degrees away from each other, Microsoft disables the triple-sensor module and you’re stuck with the selfie option. Presumably, this is to prevent you from accidentally capturing the back of the device, but it just takes away user control. Why should Microsoft lock you out of the superior camera option on the Duo 2 just because the screens are open a little more than 180 degrees?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/972bf0a0-3204-11ec-b7fd-7b7c102acaea" alt="A person holding up the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 to take a photo of a bookshelf. The screen on the right shows the viewfinder while the screen on the left displays a picture taken earlier. " data-uuid="3c4dd9b8-7aff-3354-bf1b-e4136775525a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>The UI is also supposed to allow you to use the spare screen as a photo viewer, so you can see your shots right after snapping them, but this didn’t happen consistently. And in a 10-minute photo shoot, the app crashed at least three times, showing a generic error message. To top it all off, the camera fails to keep up with rapid-fire shooting, sometimes taking a few seconds to snap a picture and save it to your gallery (I suspect this delay has more to do with the UI trying to pull up the image on the other screen than an actual processor issue). Throw in the touch input lag I mentioned earlier and the entire camera experience is a disaster. It’s as if Microsoft never bothered to test the camera at all.</p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>Beyond the software quirks, the Duo 2’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">high-end Snapdragon 888 chipset</a> actually seemed to struggle at times. When I played a few rounds of <em>Airplane Chefs </em>in one-screen mode, the device ran hot and then completely stalled, leaving me unable to serve food to impatient passengers. This doesn’t just occur when I have the two screens flipped all the way around, either. On the whole, the area under the camera module tends to get warm. But when the Duo 2’s sides are stuck back to back, it seems to keep the heat from dissipating quickly enough.</p><p>Then there’s the countless number of times apps have just died on me. I handed the Duo 2 off to a friend with OneNote on the right screen, so they could try the keyboard. It refused to pull up the keyboard and shortly after stopped registering any touches. We closed and opened the device and the app still wasn’t working. Only a force quit revived OneNote. Oh and sometimes when I was using just one screen in landscape mode, a screenshot would capture the home screen instead of the app I was using on it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ba6d8380-3204-11ec-bd5b-227f37b87019" alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo 2 stands almost closed, with the logo on its back facing the camera." data-uuid="92ca33ff-74e3-31a2-a40e-2b54f2a4b8f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>The one thing I’m impressed with is that the Duo 2’s battery life isn’t any worse than before — which is a very low bar. This year’s model clocked 10 hours and 16 minutes with our video rundown test playing on one screen and the Android home page on the other. The original Duo came in at 10 hours and 32 minutes, and considering the faster screens, that seems fair. For what it’s worth, the Fold 3, which has a 120Hz panel, lasted 14 hours and 3 minutes.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>I could go on about all the little ways the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Duo 2" href="https://fave.co/3E35di8">Duo 2</a> struggles, but that would take forever. Some of them are minor and just require a little adjusting, while others, like the camera app, are downright unforgivable. Things Microsoft introduced to improve the experience, like the triple rear cameras and Glance bar, are only slight improvements. I appreciate the faster screens, but at this price they’re almost a given. I haven’t been able to test the Slim Pen 2, but it’s worth noting you’ll have to pay an extra $130 for it.</p><p>Like the Galaxy Z Fold 3, the Duo 2 is suffering a sort of identity crisis. Neither device works well as a phone replacement, but at least Samsung’s foldable has reliable software and good cameras. Despite the improvements, the Duo 2 is still a kind of gimmicky device that’s costly to boot and only people with $1,500 to burn and who really <em>need</em> a dual-screen phone should buy it.</p><p></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs </h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: Snapdragon 888 with 8GB of RAM</p><p><strong>Storage</strong>: 128/256/512GB </p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Displays</strong>: 2 x 5.8-inch AMOLED at 1,892 x 1,344 (401ppi) with 90Hz adaptive refresh rate; Combined 8.3-inch AMOLED at 2,688 x 1,892</p><p><strong>Rear triple cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.7 wide-angle camera with OIS; 16MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (110-degree FOV); 12MP f/2.4 51mm telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom</p><p><strong>Front camera</strong>: 12MP f/2.0 camera</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: Android 11 with Duo 2 UI</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: 4,449mAh</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: USB-C port with fast wired charging at 23W.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>:  Open: 184.5 x 145.2 x 5.5 mm (7.26 x 5.71 x 0.21 inches);  Closed: 145.2 x 92.1 x 11.0 mm (7.26 x 3.62 x 0.42 inches)</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 10.01 ounces; 284 grams</p><p><strong>Fingerprint sensor</strong>: Yes, on power button</p><p><strong>Waterproofing</strong>: IP68</p><p><strong>NFC</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Headphone jack</strong>: No</p></div><p>Photos by David Imel (<a href="https://twitter.com/DurvidImel">@DurvidImel</a>)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-camera-sample-specs-glance-bar-130004036.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">59213511-d4f6-47b1-91f2-c82eee36c9af</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634822606</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T13:23:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a03fcff0-3203-11ec-bfd7-6f98d553a93e" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a03fcff0-3203-11ec-bfd7-6f98d553a93e" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Microsoft Surface Duo 2 on a white surface with a bookshelf in the background.

While Raspberry Pi can still produce as many as 7 million units this year, which is the same as last year&#39;s, companies are buying up more components than before to ensure that they can build their products. As a result, Raspberry Pi Zero and the 2GB variant of Raspberry Pi 4 are in short supply.&nbsp;</p><p>To address the issue, the manufacturer is moving back the 2GB Raspberry Pi 4&#39;s price to $45. The model debuted at that price, but Raspberry Pi <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-27-35-raspberry-pi-4-double-ram-2-gb.html">lowered</a> it to $35 in 2020 to replace its 1GB counterpart that was discontinued completely. Upton said the price increase in components needed for the boards means selling the 2GB Pi 4 for $35 is no longer economically viable, so the company is temporarily bringing back its old price. It&#39;s also reintroducing the 1GB variant for $35 to give customers another choice.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Upton explained in the post that the issue will affect its products built on 40nm silicon the most. Since the company has to distribute components wisely, it has decided to prioritize Compute Module 3, Compute Module 3+ and Raspberry Pi 3B, and to deprioritize Raspberry Pi 3B+. It&#39;s now encouraging industrial users of the Raspberry Pi 3B+ to use the 1GB variant of Raspberry Pi 4 instead.</p><p>The CEO said those changes are temporary and that the changes in pricing aren&#39;t here to stay. &quot;As global supply chain issues moderate, we’ll keep revisiting this issue, and we want to get pricing back to where it was as fast as we can,&quot; he wrote. That said, the company is expecting its supply chain issues to persist all throughout 2022.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/raspberry-pi-first-ever-price-increase-122509763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c46c142c-7ef2-4abd-ac93-d9e19e7c2284</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 12:25:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634819130</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T12:25:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9f718c60-3264-11ec-9deb-141f2f5c6457" width="900" height="580" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9f718c60-3264-11ec-9deb-141f2f5c6457" width="900" height="580" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Will Facebook change its name?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, will Facebook pull the trigger and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reportedly-changing-name-042958266.html">change its name</a>?
