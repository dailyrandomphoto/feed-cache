They’re expensive, have questionable durability and — at least so far — don’t offer a compelling reason for the form factor. Having said all that, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-flip-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140057384.html">Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>, Samsung’s new clamshell foldable, is almost enough to change my mind.</p><p>Revealed alongside the Galaxy Z Fold 3, which unfurls into a squarish almost-tablet display, it’s the $1,000 Flip 3 that had me considering buying a foldable.</p><p>Maybe it’s because Samsung seems to be trying to address those issues I have. Both phones are cheaper (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-5g-galaxy-z-flip-3-galaxy-watch-4-galaxy-watch-4-classic-galaxy-buds-2-144623619.html">if not cheap</a>) compared to their predecessors, with the Z Fold 3 now $200 less than the Z Fold 2 was at launch.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-flip-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140057384.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/011485d0-fb5b-11eb-bffb-63016b8a6959" style="height:2000;width:3000;" alt="Samsung Galaxy Flip 3 5G" data-uuid="77c37d13-7203-3bd1-a617-526cf884a768"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure></a><p>After the broken screen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-17-samsung-galaxy-fold-pre-orders-review-units-breaking.html">debacle</a> of the original Galaxy Fold, Samsung is keen to stress the hardiness of its new premium phone, which it says is 80 percent stronger. I’m not sure how that increase was so precisely measured, but with IPX8 water resistance, a new stronger aluminum hinge and frame and a Gorilla Glass Victus coating, on paper at least, it sounds tougher.</p><p>The<a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140051893.html"> Z Fold 3</a> might have the tech advances, with S Pen support and an in-screen selfie camera that can camouflage itself, but the Z Flip 3 is the one that caught my attention when I had the chance to play with the phones at a London preview event. The Flip series seems like the foldable device for now, melding how we use our smartphones in 2021 with foldable screens that are, let’s be honest, still not quite perfect.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung has expanded the external screen so it functions better for checking notifications or using the cameras without opening the Flip 3. Not that I need an excuse to flip open the satisfying hinge on the thing. I’ll wait for Cherlynn Low’s full review on both phones, however, before I start getting into preorders. Expect those very soon.&nbsp;</p><p>We do have a full review on Samsung’s newest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">true wireless earbuds</a> to keep you occupied for now.</p><p>-Mat Smith</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-flip-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140057384.html"><ins>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 hands-on</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140051893.html"><ins>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 hands-on</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-august-11-supercut-170007617.html"><ins>Here&#39;s everything Samsung announced at its August Unpacked event</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html"><ins>Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 review: Premium features at an affordable price</ins></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html">Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic hands-on</a></h2><h3>Samsung’s new wearable has a built-in body composition scanner.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1fb67ef0-fa55-11eb-bfff-a5413d00e762" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="A pink Galaxy Watch 4 on a wrist" data-uuid="a4d3f0d7-1062-31d6-8bba-f2bad347a665"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure></a><p>Alongside the foldables, Samsung also had two wearables to reveal. These are the fruits of its renewed collaboration with Google. For the sake of clarification, Samsung’s getting rid of the “Active” branding from its existing lineup — the Watch 4 is the spiritual successor to the Watch Active 2 (there wasn’t an Active 3), while it’s adding the “Classic” moniker to the previous “regular” Watch line. The big differences between the two? A rotating bezel and a hundred bucks.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-drops-its-lawsuit-against-a-manufacturer-of-i-phone-emulators-082100357.html">Apple drops its lawsuit against maker of iPhone emulation software</a></h2><h3>The move comes after Apple suffered a major court loss in the dispute.</h3><p></p><p>Apple has settled its 2019 lawsuit with Corellium, a company that builds virtual iOS devices used by security researchers to find bugs in iPhones and other iOS devices.

What a lot of people had written off as <em>Family Guy</em>- or <em>Rick and Morty</em>-Trek ended up being a wholesome love letter to the history of the franchise. It was filled with plenty of low-brow humor, sure, but it also showcased characters who genuinely cared about each other and what they do. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-august-12-213816677.html">season two</a> is more of the same.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Lower Decks</em> takes its name from a season-seven <em>The Next Generation</em> episode that revolved around the lives of four ensigns, and the parts they played in a mission that only the bridge crew really understood the full scope of. It’s generally considered one of the best episodes of the franchise, which meant that anything that even vaguely referenced it had a lot to live up to. Luckily, <em>Lower Decks</em> creator and executive producer Mike McMahan was a big fan with deep knowledge of Trek. He is also the creator of the <a href="https://twitter.com/tng_s8?lang=en">@TNG_S8</a> parody Twitter account, as well as a veteran of animated shows like <em>South Park</em>, <em>Axe Cop</em> and, yes, <em>Rick and Morty</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fe37c6e0-f945-11eb-bffb-387157ecf4fd" alt="Pictured (L-R): Jack Quaid as Ensign Brad Boimler, Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner, Eugene Cordero as Ensign Rutherford and No&#xc3;&#xab;l Wells as Ensign Tendi of the CBS All Access series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

(It turned out to be a party in honor of the senior officers, which confused our protagonists even more.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/31e46250-f946-11eb-befa-04fd9e959d20" alt="Pictured Gillian Vigman as Dr. T&#39;ana, Jerry O&#39;Connell as Commander Ransom, Dawnn Lewis as Captain Freeman, Paul Scheer as Lt.

But Star Trek doesn’t have a good track record of sticking to a concept. The majority of shows since <em>TNG</em> have started out as one thing and become something else over the course of their runs. All shows evolve, but the changes in Trek have been obvious and purposeful. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ds9-kingdom-solar-opposites-170043593.html"><em>Deep Space Nine</em></a> was intended to be a “frontier outpost” type of show, showing the long-term relationship between the Starfleet and one of the planets it encountered, Bajor. By season three they were given a warship, and season four brought in <em>TNG</em>-veteran Worf and a war with the Klingon Empire.</p><p><em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> operated on the premise of “what if a Starfleet ship was lost far from home?” And it stuck with that, sure, but it also continued to operate like any other Starfleet vessel over seven seasons, and the ship remained in surprisingly good condition despite the lack of spacedocks for repair — something that frustrated writer Ronald D. Moore and later spurred him to create the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/battlestar%20galactica"><em>Battlestar Galactica</em></a> reboot (the title ship was a wreck by the finale). They also ended up re-establishing contact with the Federation in later seasons, which dampened the whole “alone in a strange quadrant” theme.</p><div id="0f8cede6cc884f58ae30e477e765c3d8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxdKo0eXUKY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Enterprise</em> wasn’t even called Star Trek until its third season. But still, though it was a show that promised to show us the early origins of Starfleet and the Federation, the first two seasons got bogged down in a “Temporal Cold War” and later episodes brought in 24th-century-era baddies like the Borg and Ferengi.</p><p>The latest concept switcheroo was the premiere <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Paramount+" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/5bM07o">Paramount+</a> Trek show, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-211633637.html"><em>Discovery</em></a>. The producers touted it as the first series where the captain was not the main character, with the program focusing on Commander Michael Burnham instead. This sounded great in theory, as it could show us a different side of Starfleet. In practice, however, even if Burnham wasn’t the captain the entire universe seemed to revolve around her anyway: the mysterious “Red Angel〞of season two turned out to be her mother (and her). The show ended up jettisoning its 23rd century setting after that, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-season-3-trailer-040651412.html">traveling to the 32nd century</a> to a galaxy with a Federation in tatters. As of the end of season three Burnham became the captain anyway. So much for any <em>Lower Decks</em>-esque perspective on that show.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8fa67590-f946-11eb-97ef-5abb2fa37bb0" data-uuid="0c37f1dd-e756-3180-865f-81c694a5e3d9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>Season two of <em>Lower Decks</em> starts off a bit shaky in that regard — after the events of the last few episodes, Mariner is now BFF with the captain (who is also her mother) and Boimler is a bridge officer on the <em>USS Titan</em>. Neither of them feel like the scrappy underdog anymore. At least Tendi and Rutherford are still pretty minor players, though Tendi is alarmed at sudden changes in Rutherford’s personality and worries she may be losing his friendship.</p><p>The premiere finds Mariner having the carte blanche to go on any side missions she wants, and in one of these authorized-unauthorized missions she accidentally turns first officer Jack Ransom into a god-like being set on taking over a planet. The latter event is, at least, a pretty standard plot contrivance for Star Trek. Where <em>Lower Decks</em> stands apart is that as Ransom is threatening the <em>Cerritos</em> and banging away at its shields, the camera cuts to Tendi attacking Rutherford in a corridor, afraid that his new personality traits mean he’s suffering a serious disease, or that he just doesn’t like her anymore. The larger existential threat is background color in this scene (literally, as you can see rainbow beams blasting outside the window) while the show chooses to focus on the individual struggles of these two characters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1119f480-f947-11eb-bb74-ad0191d975c2" data-uuid="e25407be-af10-3c12-9ad6-dfe94b3155b8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>By the end of the episode Rutherford and Tendi sort things out, and even Mariner gets put back in her place, with the partnership between her and her mother dissolved and Beckett back in the brig. The only missing piece of the fabulous four is Boimler and well, he’s not having a great time on the <em>Titan</em>, because maybe things are a bit too exciting up on the bridge. The lower decks of the <em>USS Cerritos</em> are the still place to be, with season two off to a solid start.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-premiere-strange-energies-070032163.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3e070795-f474-4950-b0fe-ebc97b17056a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 07:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628539351</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T20:02:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5d3312e0-f945-11eb-a9f5-d304df63cf07" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5d3312e0-f945-11eb-a9f5-d304df63cf07" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Strange Energies" -- Noel Wells as Ensign Tendi, Eugene Cordero. as Ensign Rutherford and Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner of the U.S.S.

At the same time, it&#39;s making it more difficult for contributors to join the Partner Program based on follower numbers and other criteria, the platform <a href="https://blog.medium.com/evolving-the-partner-program-2613708f9f3c">announced</a> yesterday.&nbsp;</p><p>When Medium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-23-mediums-subscription-offers-all-you-can-read-stories-for-5.html">launched</a> its Partner Platform, it used a Netflix-like model that let subscribers access all content for $5 per month of $50 per year. Contributors would then get paid based on how much time members spent reading their content — if a member spent 10 percent of their time on one writer&#39;s work, that writer would get 10 percent of the subscriber&#39;s payments. At the same time, if a reader converted to a paying member within 30 days of reading a writer&#39;s work, the writer would credit for that time.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the new model, writers in the Partner Program will have a personalized referral landing page. If a reader purchases a subscription via a writer&#39;s page, the writer will get half the fee for the entire life of the subscription — minus payment processing fees. So, for every 100 members who sign up via a partner&#39;s referral landing page, that partner will make $201 per month.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>You can leverage your landing page however you’d like: share it on social platforms, link to it on Medium post pages, or include it on your profile. Directing your readers to this page is completely optional.</p></blockquote><p>At the same time, when a non-paying reader subscribes to a writer&#39;s email, they&#39;ll automatically be given the option to convert to a Medium member. If they do, that will count toward the writer&#39;s referral earnings.&nbsp;</p><p>Medium noted that subscriber referral earnings will be in addition to Partner Program earnings based on member read time. Presumably, however, there would be less money to go around from referred subscribers, since half their revenue would be going to the referring partner.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, Medium has made it a bit more difficult to become a partner. Going forward, writers must have at least 100 follower and one published Medium story. Even if you meet all those requirements, you might lose your status if you don&#39;t publish anything within a six month period. Existing partners will retain their status until the end of 2021, and if they haven&#39;t reached the requirements at that point, they&#39;ll be removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Medium&#39;s new model appears to be a response to Substack in particular, which pays writers based on their paid subscriber totals. Substack is more generous to individual writers, taking just 10 percent of their revenue compared to the 50 percent for medium, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/11/medium-revamps-its-partner-program-launching-new-eligibility-requirements-and-referral-bonuses/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. Unlike Substack, though, Medium readers get access to everything on the platform, not just a single writer&#39;s work.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mediums-partner-program-will-start-paying-writers-for-subscriber-referrals-044932271.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7540bdd1-22cc-4bbb-8864-333abc5ba90b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 04:49:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628743772</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T04:49:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3e814730-d5ec-11eb-bf7b-ce2326a0531c" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/3e814730-d5ec-11eb-bf7b-ce2326a0531c" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pheelings Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close up of black man hands typing on a laptop sitting on a desk at home]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Black man hands typing on a laptop at home]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[German animal shelter is posting profiles of adoptable pets on Tinder]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Munich Animal Welfare Association has taken <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/purrfect-match-animal-shelter-puts-lonely-pets-tinder-2021-08-11/">a unique approach</a> to matching its resident adoptable pets with their new forever homes: putting their profiles on popular dating app, Tinder.

Penned by Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and co-sponsored by Amy Klobuchar, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amy-klobuchar-antitrust-senate-bill-171401466.html">chair of the Senate antitrust subcommittee</a>, the proposed legislation would &quot;prevent app stores from disadvantaging developers.&quot;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/8.11.21%20-%20Open%20App%20Markets%20Act%20-%20Bill%20Text.pdf">Open App Markets Act</a> reads like a wishlist of items groups like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-spotify-and-others-form-alliance-against-app-store-dominance-135026221.html">Coalition for App Fairness</a> have advocated for in their fight against Apple and Google. So it should come as no surprise the organization has come out in support of the proposed legislation. One of the most noteworthy provisions included in the bill&#39;s current iteration is a clause that would prohibit app marketplace owners from forcing third-party developers to use a payment system they own. Another provision aimed almost exclusively at Apple would force platform holders to allow consumers to sideload software and install third-party app stores.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Payment systems have been one of the issues at the heart of the recent antitrust movement. Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-fortnite-190920925.html">kicked Epic Games off the App Store</a> after the studio implemented a way for <em>Fortnit</em>e players to skirt its 30 percent fee. Google, meanwhile, announced at the end of 2020 that it would give developers until later this year to make their apps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-google-play-194125627.html">compliant with the Play Store&#39;s billing system</a>.</p><p>&quot;The legislation would help create a more competitive app marketplace that will ignite innovation in the digital economy, and provide more options for American consumers,&quot; the Coalition for App Fairness said in a statement.</p><p>Outside of the CAF, organizations like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Internet Accountability Project support the bill. Of course, introducing legislation and passing it are two very different things. You can be sure Apple and Google will lobby to soften the Open App Markets Act since it threatens the way they do business.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bipartisan-open-app-markets-act-introduction-221732872.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0911950b-30e0-46b0-b568-0b641b024253</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 22:17:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628720255</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T22:17:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/0d595ae0-3b00-11ea-b97f-50b4929ef3cb" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/0d595ae0-3b00-11ea-b97f-50b4929ef3cb" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Savusia Konstantin via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan - July 6 2019: Fortnite app in play smartphone. close-up on screen iphone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Iphone Apps.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter rolls out redesign with proprietary Chirp font]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you went to scroll through your Twitter timeline today, you may have noticed that things look a bit different. That’s because Twitter has started rolling out a handful of design tweaks to its web client and mobile apps.

The company introduced the font back in January. According to Twitter, one of the main advantages of Chirp is the way it can align the text of tweets written in Western languages to the left-hand side of the interface. The company says that’s something that should make it easier to read content as you scroll through your timeline.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also tweaked its use of color. It says it went out of its way to use less blue and increase contrast so that both frequently used icons and visual content like images stand out.

The Netflix programs were always said to be padded out, with more installments than they really needed per season. The <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/P0ab6Y">Disney+</a> era has given us shows with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-runtime-episode-length-163011729.html">fewer</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html">episodes</a>, but that hasn’t deterred complaints about slow pacing. <em>What If…?</em>, premiering this week on the service, has a different problem: It’s frantic and rushed, like a podcast episode played at 1.5x speed.</p><p>The concept behind <em>What If…?</em> is simple. Take a pivotal moment from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel%20cinematic%20universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, change one thing, see what happens. In the premiere episode, set during the events of <em>Captain America: The First Avenger</em>, Peggy Carter chooses to stay in the room where Steve is receiving the super soldier serum. Steve gets shot, forcing Peggy to jump into the machine and get bulked up in his place.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="a841792d6fc94381b796ec345168bcb7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L23B6577hA4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>You’d need to be intimately familiar with the original movie to spot the difference, which is why the omniscient narrator is there to point it out. It’s probably the only time the episode stops to catch its breath.</p><p>The problem is that this is a half-hour show attempting to present an alternate version of a two-hour movie. It isn’t even enough to just say that Captain Carter has super powers; they feel the need to show how the events of the entire movie play out, down to the final battle with the Red Skull. There isn’t a lot of time for character development, because they assume you already know the characters well from seeing them on the silver screen. (Also, why is she Captain Carter and not Captain Britain?)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5accd640-facf-11eb-97af-d849ff554a1f" style="height:1838;width:3835;" alt="Captain Carter with her mighty shield" data-uuid="9103a4eb-bdd1-3090-82a2-95d586d281a2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>It runs from plot point to plot point, a highlight reel of the film with some small and a lot of big changes. You’ll probably want to rewatch the original movie either before or after, just because there are so many winks and nudges to it that the episode simply cannot stand alone. It’s like a DVD extra and fan fiction had a baby — which, to be fair, is what the original comic felt like.</p><p>The difference here is that this is a version of <em>What If...?</em> that gets to play in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mcu">MCU</a> sandbox, with the voices and likenesses to boot (except for Hugo Weaving, who is once again replaced by Ross Marquand as the Red Skull). Animation is the only way to pull it off, given that the cast and setting changes with every episode so a live action production would be prohibitively expensive.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/94fb6610-facf-11eb-9fff-ce21547852b7" style="height:1748;width:3840;" alt="The Watcher" data-uuid="bf0431ba-f891-3cc4-8f70-433799625d62"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>But, despite being owned by one of the most famous animation studios in the world, Marvel Studios  went with third-party animators. It’s a cel shaded style, which is more often used in video games and here looks a lot like rotoscoping. It’s sort of stiff and awkward, with more attention paid to making characters look like their actors instead of being more fluid or expressive. It’s a shame, given that Disney’s 2012 short film <a href="https://youtu.be/XrqSF2OOz_M"><em>Paperman</em></a> utilized a hybrid 2D/3D style which looks similar to this, but with a lot more personality.</p><p>Future episodes will explore other divergences from the MCU, like T’Challa becoming Star Lord or Tony Stark getting saved by Killmonger. So it’s likely some episodes will be far more enjoyable than others based on their conceit alone, though Captain Carter is still a solid start. But a good concept can’t completely overcome animation and pacing issues.</p><div id="d201d0e0455d42e3a69b85ab8b580483"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jt64UwA9O00?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-disney-plus-animated-episode-one-183034023.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ebc575e-6e88-441b-a399-209e749578b1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 18:30:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628706047</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T18:21:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c2ee82b0-face-11eb-bdbf-d139fa8b6c62" width="3840" height="1748" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c2ee82b0-face-11eb-bdbf-d139fa8b6c62" width="3840" height="1748" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Captain Carter and the Howling Commandos]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Marvel What If...?]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer's latest Hammerhead True Wireless earbuds include ANC and RGB lighting]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Razer came out with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-29-razer-hammerhead-true-wireless-earbuds.html">Hammerhead True Wireless</a> earbuds in 2019, it was one of the first companies to include a low-latency Bluetooth mode for gaming.

With both turned off, Razer claims you can look forward to six-and-a-half hours of playtime on a single charge and an additional 26 hours with the included charging case. However, those figures drop to four and 20 hours when you enable both features.

One of the more noteworthy features of the foldable is that it includes an under-display camera. When it’s not in use, the Fold 3’s internal selfie shooter will attempt to blend in with the screen. While you can still see the component, particularly if your eyes drift to that part of the display, it helps make the device feel like more of a traditional tablet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And speaking of tablets, you can use Samsung&#39;s S Pen stylus with the Galaxy Fold 3. The company devoted an entire segment of its Unpacked event to detailing the time and effort it invested to make the two compatible with one another. In short, the $50 S Pen Fold Edition and S Pen Pro feature rounder tips that can automatically retract if you apply too much pressure to the Fold 3’s internal display. Samsung also made the screen protector 80 percent stronger.</p><p>Once you get past those upgrades, a more capable Cover Display and the addition of IPX8-rated waterproofing, the one thing that stands out the most about the Fold 3 is that Samsung plans to sell it for a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:more palatable $1,800" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">more palatable $1,800</a>.

A lot of that has to do with the fact Samsung plans to sell its latest clamshell foldable for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,000" href="https://fave.co/3Ay0WkN">$1,000</a> when it comes out on August 27th.

That means there’s more room for notifications and widgets, and you can do things like access Android’s quick settings menu and Samsung Pay without opening the device.</p><h2>Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5912f9a0-fac1-11eb-a7e3-be3eb8f06587" alt="Galaxy Watch 4" data-uuid="c6a869cf-4f3e-30a5-ad5c-d8fb5744e786"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Once you get past the mouthful that is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">Wear OS powered by Samsung</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html">Galaxy Watch 4 </a>looks like it has a lot going for it. In our hands-on, we found the Galaxy Watch 4’s software had more in common with Tizen than Wear OS. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. All of the usual flourishes that made the company’s previous wearables compelling were still there, with the added advantage of better third-party app support.</p><p>In terms of hardware, Samsung added a 3-in-1 BioActive sensor that can measure your body fat percentage, a new 5nm processor and 50 percent more RAM. Those latter additions should make the Galaxy Watch 4 feel faster. What’s more, the more expensive Watch 4 Classic features the return of the company’s much-loved rotating bezel.

According to the board, Facebook mistakenly removed the post for violating its hate speech policy under the belief it targeted Chinese people.</p><p>&quot;This case highlights the importance of considering context when enforcing hate speech policies, as well as the importance of protecting political speech,&quot; the Oversight Board <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/342799874210662-oversight-board-overturns-facebook-decision-case-2021-007-fb-ua/"><ins>wrote</ins></a>. &quot;This is particularly relevant in Myanmar given the February 2021 coup and Facebook’s key role as a communications medium in the country.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The user, who appeared to be in Myanmar, posted the message in question in April. The post argued that, rather than providing funding to Myanmar&#39;s military following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-myawaddy-tv-station-171950609.html">the coup in February</a>, tax revenue should be given to the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hlutaw, a group of legislators that opposed the coup. The post, which was written in Burmese, was viewed around half a million times.</p><p>Although no users reported the post, Facebook decided to take it down. The post used profanity while referencing Chinese policy in Hong Kong. Facebook&#39;s translation of the post led four content reviewers to believe that the user was criticizing Chinese people.&nbsp;</p><p>Under its hate speech rules, Facebook doesn&#39;t allow content that targets someone or a group of people based on ethnicity, race or national origins that use “profane terms or phrases with the intent to insult.” The user who wrote the post claimed in their appeal that they shared it in an effort to “stop the brutal military regime.”</p><p>The Oversight Board says context is particularly important in this case. The Burmese language uses the same word to refer to both a state and people who are from that state. Other factors made it clear the user was referring to the Chinese state, according to the board.</p><p>Two translators who reviewed the post &quot;did not indicate any doubt&quot; that the word at the heart of the case was referring to a state. The translators told the board the post includes terms that Myanmar’s government and the Chinese embassy commonly use to refer to each other. <a href="https://scontent.fymq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/m1/v/t0.41931-6/An-GdNo_tzvg5Mp6a8Jw9Ixx5mSBMa7G7sJBqaI4Vm-DV8D-OIZ9g3SqvtWB77eqZ2eVRTeny9K0bWEk9b63Sp5qJbgliRiKFXKZ5b93tGSiUPghLnGfowrHCwxiMwwxwgK9CnP5Taa1KtDzf1OdDRzZCA?ccb=10-5&amp;oh=def8e2cf3624fd9bcaf2fc279871b77d&amp;oe=61188B4D&amp;_nc_sid=340960"><ins>Public comments</ins></a> the board received regarding the case indicated the post was political speech.</p><p>The Oversight Board ordered Facebook to restore the post and recommended Facebook ensures &quot;its Internal Implementation Standards are available in the language in which content moderators review content. If necessary to prioritize, Facebook should focus first on contexts where the risks to human rights are more severe.&quot;</p><p>The company has had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-27-facebook-bans-military-myanmar-un-report.html"><ins>complicated history</ins></a> with Myanmar. In 2018, Facebook was accused of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-20-facebook-accused-of-supporting-ethnic-cleansing-in-myanmar.html"><ins>censoring information</ins></a> about ethnic cleansing in the country. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-06-facebook-myanmar-bsr-report.html"><ins>admitted</ins></a> it didn&#39;t do enough to stop people from using the platform to incite offline violence and &quot;foment division,&quot; following a report <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-15-facebook-investigating-myanmar-violence.html"><ins>it commissioned</ins></a> about the matter.</p><p>Soon after the coup, Facebook was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/myanmar-blocks-facebook-232138617.html"><ins>temporarily blocked</ins></a> in Myanmar. After it returned, Facebook took steps to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-limiting-myanmar-military-reach-065458912.html"><ins>limit the reach</ins></a> of the country&#39;s military on its platform, and later <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-myanmar-military-ban-151924455.html"><ins>banned the military outright</ins></a> on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>The Oversight Board previously told Facebook to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-initial-judgments-141352775.html"><ins>restore a post</ins></a> from another user based in Myanmar. As with the latest ruling, the board said Facebook misinterpreted the post as hate speech. While it was “pejorative or offensive,” the post didn&#39;t “advocate hatred” or directly call for violence.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-myanmar-coup-restore-post-china-164304497.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e3fb4ab-5c88-4647-ae04-6a218d606ba4</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 16:43:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628700189</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T16:43:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/54039d80-fac0-11eb-aedd-3f3dfff0e68e" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/54039d80-fac0-11eb-aedd-3f3dfff0e68e" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A member of the local Myanmar (Burmese) diaspora holding a national flag of Myanmar seen in front of the GPO in Dublin at a pro-democracy rally called 'Global Spring Revolution' for Myanmar.

To start, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-family-bell-smart-speaker-display-150006076.html">Family Bell</a> is coming to mobile devices.

Search <a href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/periodic-table/">now has</a> an interactive periodic table that uses augmented reality and 3D to help children visualize atoms and learn useful tidbits about the elements. On their phones, young ones can tap a Live Translation button in search to recall a particular phrase. Assistant will also offer more diverse educational stories from The English Schoolhouse, while Harry Potter fans will have the option of listening to <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> stories on Android or Assistant smart displays.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And yes, there&#39;s something for the parents who need to get moving.

Ambient sound, wireless charging and other premium features were already standard on the company’s earbuds, but with the Pro it added true active noise cancellation (ANC), 360 audio and more. Now Samsung is circling back and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-specs-price-availability-140039706.html">redesigning its entry-level buds</a>. With the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Buds 2" href="https://fave.co/3CHY5b8">Galaxy Buds 2</a>, the company brings features typically reserved for its pricier models to a set of $150 earbuds, reducing the number of tradeoffs that are usually required if you want to spend a little less.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="4dc945a4-a14b-4580-9098-25f7c7f6a629"/><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d2d9a2-faa6-11eb-beb7-56bc5471380c" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds. This successor to the Galaxy Buds+ are smaller and more comfortable with premium features like wireless charging and adjustable ambient sound. However, ANC performance is only decent and there&#x002019;s no deep iOS integration like previous models. Still, at this price, Samsung has created a compelling package despite the sacrifices. " data-uuid="8f822d4b-6ed0-3b7f-9f67-7563a3ea58e5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>For the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung ditched the triangular touch panel and fit wing for an oval shape that’s reminiscent of the Galaxy Buds Pro. The outer panel is seamless, so you can’t tell where the touch controls are exactly. There’s no button or frame outlining them; the only things visible on the outside are two of the three microphones, one of which replaces the tiny grille on the Pro model.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung says the Galaxy Buds 2 are 15-percent smaller and 20-percent lighter than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review.html">Galaxy Buds+</a> which were already quite tiny. This makes them noticeably smaller than the Galaxy Buds Pro as well, even though the overall design is similar. The Galaxy Buds 2 aren’t as deep, which accounts for their more compact stature. Indeed, Samsung’s smallest and lightest earbuds yet are also some of its most comfortable. These earbuds are among the tiniest I’ve tested and the size helps them nestle snugly in your ear without the burden of extra weight or the protruding design you get with larger models.</p><p>Like the Galaxy Buds Pro, the outer touch panel area of the Galaxy Buds 2 has a glossy finish, although this new model is clearly made of plastic. The Pro version has a bit of metallic character, giving them a more premium look. Samsung kept the same IPX2 rating, which means you should be fine if you get caught in some drizzle, but frequent splashes and  sweaty workouts might cause problems.</p><p>The cases for both the Galaxy Buds 2 and Galaxy Buds Pro are nearly identical. They’re the exact same size and shape: a small square with rounded corners. With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung opted for a glossy finish over the previous matte exterior. Plus, every case for this new model is white, no matter which color bud you choose. Only the interior cradle that holds the earbuds and the thin seam where the case closes matches your hue preference. A single LED up front keeps you aware of the charging status while a USB-C port around back is available for wired top-ups.</p><h2><strong>Software</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d4d570-faa6-11eb-bfff-a6ccb0330834" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

However, ANC performance is only decent and there&#x002019;s no deep iOS integration like previous models. Still, at this price, Samsung has created a compelling package despite the sacrifices. " data-uuid="8bfaf659-678c-3b61-ad60-9017c55ab6e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Wearable app is where you access all of the controls and settings for the Galaxy Buds 2, just like it was for the company’s other recent earbuds. This includes the ability to switch between ANC, ambient sound and both off as well as adjusting ambient sound levels, reassigning the touch and hold gesture, selecting an EQ preset, activating hands-free Bixby and checking battery percentage. It’s also where you can employ Samsung’s Find My Earbuds feature should you misplace a bud.</p><p>Touch controls are mirrored on both sides by default with a single tap for play/pause, a double tap to skip tracks ahead and a triple tap to return to the previous song. A touch and hold function switches between active noise cancellation and ambient sound. You can’t adjust the level of environmental noise you let in on the earbuds; this just returns to your last selection. There is the option to set this to toggle between ANC and off or ambient sound and off if you dive further into the settings. You can also choose to disable all of the touch controls entirely or one or more of them individually.</p><p>Samsung gives you the ability to reconfigure the touch and hold option, but you have limited alternatives. You can set it to activate Bixby, give you one-touch access to Spotify or on-board volume control. If you choose that last option, you can only assign volume down to the left earbud and volume up to the right. As was the case with previous Galaxy Buds, a full suite of volume controls means you lose access to something handy like ANC/ambient sound.</p><p>Similar to lots of other companies, Samsung has once again included an ear tip fit test in its app. This short diagnostic plays a few seconds of sound to ensure optimal audio quality and noise cancellation.</p><p>Samsung offered deep iOS integration on the Galaxy Buds+. In fact, you got nearly all of the same features on your iPhone as someone with a Galaxy device. The company backed off of that with its recent products and continues to do so with the Galaxy Buds 2. You’ll need an Android phone to dive into all the Galaxy Wearable app offers. Samsung also has a Galaxy Buds app for Windows, but if you’re hoping to use these new earbuds with an iPhone, iPad or Mac, just know you’re stuck with the default settings.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d43930-faa6-11eb-bfff-007b5841bd5a" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds. This successor to the Galaxy Buds+ are smaller and more comfortable with premium features like wireless charging and adjustable ambient sound. However, ANC performance is only decent and there&#x002019;s no deep iOS integration like previous models. Still, at this price, Samsung has created a compelling package despite the sacrifices. " data-uuid="11a42b15-cd74-3e51-9972-3738514c73e8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The audio quality hasn’t ever been mind-blowing on Samsung’s more affordable Galaxy Buds. It was a huge disappointment on the original model, but the company made some improvements to the low-end on the Buds+. Still, overall sound quality needed work. With the Galaxy Buds 2, the company has made some strides that bring its $150 model more in line with the pricier Galaxy Buds Pro. This new version doesn’t have the same clarity and depth as its more expensive sibling, but the dynamic range is at least comparable.</p><p>Things definitely sound compressed on the Galaxy Buds 2. There’s ample bass and enough treble for certain details to cut through, but low-end tone lacks punch and tracks that are meant to sound big and bombastic are somewhat subdued. On the Buds Pro, songs like CHVRCHES “How Not to Down” are nicely layered creations of drums, piano and other instruments with airy vocals sitting on top. That all sounds noticeably flatter when I switch to the Galaxy Buds 2. It’s better than the Galaxy Buds+, but it’s worth noting that although the Galaxy Buds 2 are balanced, the company could do better when it comes to details and depth.</p><p>The EQ presets in the Galaxy Wearable app don’t offer any improvement over the default (Normal) mode. All of the options seem to pipe in too much bass, mids or treble depending on which one you select, and a few of them feel muffled.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d375e0-faa6-11eb-bc6f-ea61e8b7666d" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

" data-uuid="e7fc9ed0-268d-3cb1-bbba-05916a1e2a85"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>For the first time, Samsung is offering active noise cancellation on its most affordable Galaxy Buds. The Buds+ had an ambient sound mode, but they didn’t do anything to block environmental ruckus beyond passive noise isolation. The ANC on the Galaxy Buds 2 will help reduce distractions but it&#39;s not as powerful as pricer earbuds can muster. Samsung says the setup on this model can reduce 98 percent of background noise, but things like a white noise machine and box fans cut through to varying degrees. It’s definitely better than passive isolation on its own, but if you’re interested in earbuds that block out nearly everything, you’ll want to look elsewhere. Lastly, there’s also only one setting here where the Galaxy Buds Pro offers options for high and low noise cancellation.</p><p>Like the Pro model, the Galaxy Buds 2 is equipped with adjustable ambient sound. However, where the Galaxy Buds Pro has four levels, these new earbuds only have three. It’s basically a volume adjustment for how much environmental noise you’re letting in.</p><p>One other new feature with the Galaxy Buds 2 is available on the new Galaxy Watch 4. With that wearable, a new Buds Controller puts noise controls on your wrist. This gives you the ability to switch between ANC and ambient sound. It will come in handy if you decide to remove that option from the earbuds’ touch controls. You can also view battery status on the Watch 4 as well as disable the touch controls entirely if needed.</p><h2><strong>Call quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d2d9a1-faa6-11eb-bddb-2c1ca2db5a31" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

" data-uuid="b556d306-a7b9-351a-a23b-4eb7d5e726e8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung is once again making big promises about call quality on the Galaxy Buds 2. The company says the combination of machine learning alongside three microphones per earbud and a voice pickup unit (VPU) &quot;maximizes call clarity in all conditions.&quot; In practice, the earbuds actually do combat background noise to a degree. They don’t entirely get rid of it, but they can reduce things like background conversations and the TV a low roar, according to the person on the other end of my calls. My wife noted that while I still sounded like I was on speaker phone, the noise around me was subdued when either of us began to talk. It’s not pristine call quality, but at least Samsung delivers on some of its claims here.</p><h2><strong>Battery life</strong></h2><p>Samsung is promising up to five hours of battery life on the Galaxy Buds 2 themselves with an additional three charges in the case (20 hours total). That’s with active noise cancellation turned on. If you disable that feature, the company says you can expect up to seven and a half hours on a charge (29 hours total with the case). Like all of the previous Galaxy Buds devices, the case supports wireless charging via Qi-certified devices and Samsung’s Power Share feature on the back of its phones. There’s a quick charge option on the Galaxy Buds 2 as well that gives you an hour of non-ANC listening time after five minutes.</p><p>While five hours isn’t exactly impressive, the range for the Galaxy Buds 2 is on par with a lot of true wireless earbuds I’ve tested recently. It may not be enough to last an entire trans-continental flight, but it might get you through a full day of work, especially if you can disable noise cancellation for a spell. During my tests, I managed just over seven hours of what I’d consider “regular” use. That’s a mix of ANC, ambient sound at varying levels, calls and only using one earbud at any given time.</p><h2><strong>The competition</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d327c0-faa6-11eb-badd-9a0ea7f120a2" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

" data-uuid="77ed7595-160a-303f-8b78-c88ffefb0622"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The playing field at the $150 price point is getting increasingly crowded as more companies have solved the riddle of how to cram premium features in affordable earbuds. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">Beats Studio Buds</a> are a recent entry, offering nearly identical battery life to the Galaxy Buds 2. The only difference there is Samsung gives you one more charge in the case. The Studio Buds don’t support wireless charging and there are no options for customizing the sound, but the audio is balanced and the earbuds are tiny and comfy. Beats tossed in quick pairing support for both Android and iOS, and with the latter, you get hands-free access to Siri. They’re also the exact same price as the Galaxy Buds 2, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-sale-130-amazon-133550651.html">unless you can find them on sale</a>.</p><p>For around $150, I’m also a big fan of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">Jabra Elite 75t</a>. These earbuds are getting a little long in the tooth after a late-2019 debut, but the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-75t-anc-upgrade-150546951.html">added active noise cancellation</a> through a firmware update last fall. If you purchase a set now, they’ll ship with ANC already installed. You’ll have to pay extra for a wireless charging case, but once again, battery life is nearly identical to the Galaxy Buds 2. Jabra also massively improved the audio quality on the 75t and a new design is smaller and more comfy. Although the Elite 75t debuted at $180, you can find them nowadays for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:around $150" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;language=en_US">around $150</a>, but some colors are available <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:on Amazon for as little as $90" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082Y256ZV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;language=en_US">on Amazon for as little as $90</a>.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>With the exception of the Galaxy Buds Live, Samsung has a solid track record with its recent earbuds. That’s true once again with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Buds 2" href="https://fave.co/3CHY5b8">Galaxy Buds 2</a> where a tiny curved design keeps things comfy even for long periods of time. The company brought all of what made the Buds+ a solid affordable true wireless option back and added active noise cancellation to what is now its cheapest model. Sure, the audio could be better, but the combination of features and price make the Galaxy Buds 2 a solid option for Android users. And if you own a Samsung phone, you’ll get even more out of them.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f1770c5a-4638-42d6-84e9-92d861f211a1</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628705442</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T18:11:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/efd486d0-faa6-11eb-b94f-10d8b46c6c7b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/efd486d0-faa6-11eb-b94f-10d8b46c6c7b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 revivew]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 revivew]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[WhatsApp will let you transfer your chat history between Android and iOS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WhatsApp is finally addressing one of the biggest problems with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-encrypted-cloud-backups-android-test-215012026.html">chat histories</a>: the inability to carry them over when you switch platforms. The Facebook brand has used Samsung&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-samsung-galaxy-unpacked-august-11-event-123001799.html">Galaxy Unpacked event</a> to introduce the option of importing your WhatsApp chat history between Android and iOS.

The Z Fold 3 has a 7.6-inch, 2208 x 1768 Infinity Flex AMOLED display plus a 6.2-inch HD+ Dynamic AMOLED cover screen — both of which have 120Hz adaptive refresh rates. The main screen uses new eco technology that makes it 29 percent bright than its predecessor while consuming less energy. We thought the Z Fold 2 already had a decent battery life, and this new display technology could help the Z Fold 3 last even longer.</p><p>Samsung also brought its S Pen technology to its foldables this year, allowing you to take notes, scribble and the like on the Z Fold 3. The company has two new styli — the S Pen Fold and the S Pen Pro — and both have a retractable tip with &quot;force limit technology&quot; that should protect the Z Fold 3&#39;s main screen even while you&#39;re using it.</p><p>As far as specs go, the Z Fold 3 5G runs Android 11 on an octa-core processor, 12GB of RAM and either 256GB of 512GB of storage. It has a 4,400mAh battery and supports wireless charging. The handset has 10-megapixel selfie camera, a 4MP under-display camera plus a triple rear camera array that includes a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 12MP wide angle lens and a 12MP telephoto shooter.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4eea4240-f9ee-11eb-8b8f-c70ada557297" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G" data-uuid="60f935ea-6531-3b1e-86c5-aca16b4b948c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G starts at $999 and is available to pre-order today from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/3Ay0WkN">Samsung&#39;s website</a>. It comes in seven colors — cream, green, lavender, black, gray, pink and white, with the latter three colors being exclusive to Samsung.com. If you pre-order between August 11 and August 26, you can get a $150 Samsung credit that you can use towards another purchase.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pre-order Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G at Samsung - $999" href="https://fave.co/3Ay0WkN">Pre-order Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G at Samsung - $999</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review.html">Last year&#39;s Z Flip</a> was an ambitious departure from the slabs we&#39;re used to, but that also meant it came with a lot of uncertainty. While the Z Flip 3 probably won&#39;t be completely free of uncertainty when it comes to staying power, Samsung did try to rectify some of the problems with the previous model. The cover screen on the Z Flip 3 is four times larger than that of its predecessor, which means it&#39;ll show more information and be more useful overall. Samsung also created new widgets for the cover screen that provide glanceable information about your schedule, the weather and more.</p><p>The main screen is a 6.7-inch, 2640 x 1080 Infinity Flex AMOLED panel with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. Samsung hasn&#39;t provided additional information about the screen&#39;s durability, but we hope it&#39;s more resistant to scratches than the previous Z Flip&#39;s screen was. Flex Mode remains a feature for the screen as well, and it appears you&#39;ll be able to do more things with Flex Mode on the Z Flip 3 like watching a video on the top half of the display while being able to access controls for brightness and volume on the bottom half.</p><p>On the specs side, the Z Flip 3 5G runs Android 11 on an octa-core processor, 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. It has a 3,300mAh battery and supports wireless charging. The handset also has a 10MP selfie camera along with a dual-lens setup on the rear that includes a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens and a 12MP wide angle camera.</p><h2>Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e2f3dd0-f9ee-11eb-b079-18ec9c8b8828" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic" data-uuid="2ae52647-4649-303b-a3c4-d99e259315d4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>Both the Galaxy Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic are available for pre-order today from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/3Az958F">Samsung&#39;s website</a> and will be available widely on August 27. The Galaxy Watch 4 starts at $249 while the Watch 4 Classic starts at $349.

The watches run on Google&#39;s operating system but use the new &quot;One UI Watch&quot; interface. The new system does things like automatically install the watch version of an app when the mobile app is installed on your smartphone, and automatically sync phone and watch settings like do not disturb.</p><p>The Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic also have Samsung&#39;s new &quot;BioActive sensor,&quot; which combines optical heart rate, ECG and bioelectrical impedance analysis in one sensor. That means the watches monitor heart rate — including irregular heart rate — blood oxygen levels, body composition and even blood pressure (although the latter is not available in the US). The BioActive sensor accompanies a GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer and geomagnetic and light sensors inside the watches. A bevy of additional fitness features are available on each watch as well, including guided workouts, sleep tracking and more.</p><p>The differences between the Galaxy Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic are mostly in design. The Watch 4 has a more minimalist look and comes in fun colors like pink gold, green and silver. The Watch 4 Classic has a more traditional design and comes in black and silver. Both models have the same full-color, Super AMOLED, always-on touchscreens, but their cases sizes are a bit different. The Galaxy Watch 4&#39;s aluminum case comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes, while the Watch 4 Classic&#39;s stainless steel case (which features a rotating bezel) comes in 42mm and 46mm sizes.</p><p>Under the screen, you&#39;ll find a 5nm Exynos processor in both the Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic, along with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. LTE is available on both wearables, but WiFi, Bluetooth and NFC are standard features.</p><h2>Galaxy Buds 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a257ae40-f9ee-11eb-baff-e5f379755b14" alt="Samsung Galaxy Buds 2" data-uuid="18b11ffe-2c50-3f4c-801c-eeaddd4c9fa8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The Galaxy Buds 2 are available for pre-order today on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/3CHY5b8">Samsung&#39;s website</a> for $150 and they come in graphite, white, olive and lavender colors. These are the follow-ups to the Galaxy Buds+, which came out in 2020. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-specs-price-availability-140039706.html">Buds 2</a> are Samsung&#39;s smallest and lightest yet and they support active noise-cancellation with three adjustable ambient sound levels. Samsung also added new machine learning technology that filters out noises when you&#39;re taking calls with the buds so your voice will come through more clearly.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pre-order Galaxy Buds 2 at Samsung - $150" href="https://fave.co/3CHY5b8">Pre-order Galaxy Buds 2 at Samsung - $150</a></p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Unpacked event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/galaxy%20unpacked%20foldables"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-5g-galaxy-z-flip-3-galaxy-watch-4-galaxy-watch-4-classic-galaxy-buds-2-144623619.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b395e68e-9446-484f-abd1-26d0970b43e7</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 14:46:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628694515</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T15:08:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ecdf3dd0-fab5-11eb-babf-5d259f27eb50" width="1751" height="1120" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ecdf3dd0-fab5-11eb-babf-5d259f27eb50" width="1751" height="1120" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
