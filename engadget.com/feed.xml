The STI E-RA Concept hints at Subaru&#39;s upcoming track vehicle with 1,073HP of total power from its four Yamaha motors, extensive downforce and all-wheel drive mated to a &quot;unique&quot; torque vectoring system that maximizes grip and stability.</p><p>While the 60kWh battery is relatively small, Subaru is confident the E-RA can thrive on the track. It&#39;s hoping to set a Nürburgring lap time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds at some point in 2023. That&#39;s not as quick as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-03-vw-id-r-breaks-nurburgring-efficiency-record.html">VW&#39;s ID.R</a> (6 minutes 5 seconds), but it&#39;s comfortably ahead of road cars like Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-intrigue-at-the-nurburgring-as-tesla-unofficially-beats-porsche.html">Model S Plaid</a> (7 minutes 35 seconds). The company plans to test the E-RA at Japanese racing circuits later in 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f7785d60-7712-11ec-a797-83de8f97ecd9" style="height:1280;width:1920;" alt="Subaru Solterra STI Concept" data-uuid="e113bbb2-c185-3494-b030-e2b09e1e55bd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Subaru</div></figure><p>The brand also unveiled a Solterra STI Concept (at middle) that, as the name implies, is a sportier version of the upcoming crossover. Subaru didn&#39;t discuss under-body changes, but the upgraded Solterra has a roof spoiler, skirt spoilers and other customizations to signal its performance ambitions.</p><p>However much the E-RA represents Subaru&#39;s motorsport plans, it&#39;s also serving as a declaration of intent. Like VW&#39;s racer, it shows the company is serious about EVs and can produce high-performance cars in addition to everyday people haulers. The challenge is to translate lessons learned from concepts like this to regular vehicles. Subaru is late to EVs compared even to incumbents like VW, Mercedes and GM, and it may need to move quickly if it wants to counter the electrification efforts of its rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/subaru-sti-e-ra-concept-electric-race-car-213630682.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5f98962-82ac-4c6c-95ef-1f34416111bb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 21:36:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642368991</ingested><modified>2022-01-16T21:36:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cb17fa40-7709-11ec-a4be-a9544de38301" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cb17fa40-7709-11ec-a4be-a9544de38301" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Subaru]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Subaru STI E-RA Concept electric race car]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Subaru STI E-RA Concept electric race car]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Safari exploit can leak browser histories and Google account info]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple device users appear to be vulnerable to a significant browser privacy flaw. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/16/safari-bug-leak-browsing-history-info/">According</a> to <em>9to5Mac</em>, FingerprintJS has <a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/indexeddb-api-browser-vulnerability-safari-15/">disclosed</a> an exploit that lets attackers obtain your recent browser history, and even some Google account info, from Safari 15 across all supported platforms as well as third-party browsers on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. The IndexedDB framework (used to store data on many browsers) is violating the &quot;same-origin&quot; policy that prevents documents and scripts from one location (such as a domain or protocol) from interacting with content from another, letting appropriately coded websites deduce Google info from signed-in users as well as histories from open tabs and windows.</p><p>The flaw only compromises the names of the databases rather than the content itself. However, this would still be enough for a malicious site owner to grab your Google username, discover your profile picture and otherwise learn more about you. The history could also be used to piece together a rudimentary profile of the sites you like. Private browsing won&#39;t defeat the exploit, FingerprintJS said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked Apple for comment. FingerprintJS said it reported the issue on November 28th, however, and that Apple hadn&#39;t yet addressed it with security patches honoring same-origin policy. Until then, the only solution may be to either use a third-party browser on Macs or block all JavaScript, neither of which is necessarily an option.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/safari-webkit-exploit-browser-history-google-account-200711732.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3d8fe56-eb30-4ef0-a821-19730c7be124</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 20:07:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642363633</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T01:58:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0fe9a3a0-7703-11ec-9ddf-d35fd3b1c7e7" width="2000" height="1311" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0fe9a3a0-7703-11ec-9ddf-d35fd3b1c7e7" width="2000" height="1311" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro with Safari browser]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro with Safari browser]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Walmart may offer a cryptocurrency and NFTs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Walmart apparently doesn&#39;t want to be left out of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ap-nft-marketplace-photojournalism-134011058.html">the crypto rush</a>. <em>CNBC</em> has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/16/walmart-is-quietly-preparing-to-enter-the-metaverse.html">learned</a> Walmart filed several trademark <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=97197301&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch">applications</a> with the USPTO in late December for selling virtual goods, and in another filing said it would provide a cryptocurrency as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">NFTs</a>.

As <em>The Guardian</em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/ukraine-says-evidence-points-to-russia-being-behind-cyber-attack">reports</a>, Ukraine&#39;s digital transformation ministry has blamed Russia for the hack, accusing the country of fighting a &quot;hybrid war&quot; meant to &quot;destabilize&quot; an already tense situation and erode trust in the Ukranian government. While officials didn&#39;t elaborate on the evidence linking the attack to Russia, Microsoft shared details late Saturday that suggested a hostile nation was responsible.</p><p>The company&#39;s Threat Intelligence Center noted that the code was purely destructive malware disguised as ransomware. It had a ransom note, a Bitcoin wallet and an encrypted messaging identifier, but no recovery mechanism — in fact, it wipes the Master Boot Record (the hard drive element that tells a PC how to load the OS) and downloads malware meant solely to corrupt files. All known targets are in Ukraine, and there aren&#39;t any tangible links between this campaign and other groups.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Russia denied any involvement in the cyberattack. A spokesperson for President Putin said Ukraine pinned everything on Russia, &quot;even the weather.&quot; Russia has long been accused of using cyberattacks to target its political opponents, including Ukraine, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-fancy-bear-reportedly-hacked-us-agency-213304085.html">the US</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-20-microsoft-fancy-bear-eu-elections.html">European countries</a>.</p><p>Microsoft said it wasn&#39;t certain about the current stage of the hacking operation or the scope of the damage. It wasn&#39;t yet clear if there were other victims in Ukraine or beyond. However, it&#39;s safe to presume the timing of the attack is problematic regardless of the perpetrator. Ukraine and its allies have been worrying for months about signs of a looming Russian invasion, and the US on January 14th claimed Russia was planning a false flag operation that would help it justify that invasion. The cyberattack appears to be exacerbating those tensions, and may have weakened Ukraine&#39;s government infrastructure at a critical moment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ukraine-blames-russia-for-cyberattack-151210108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">915658f9-c30e-45cd-bd2d-b0034156478f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 15:12:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642345931</ingested><modified>2022-01-16T15:12:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/864b49d0-76d7-11ec-a62b-6fba360166d7" width="3840" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/864b49d0-76d7-11ec-a62b-6fba360166d7" width="3840" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2022/01/14: In this photo illustration, a warning message in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish languages is displayed on a smartphone screen.

New York resident Alejandro Vivar <a href="https://www.law360.com/newyork/articles/1455512/apple-sued-for-fraud-over-headphone-charging-capacity">has filed</a> a potential class action lawsuit over allegations <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-16-beats-powerbeats-pro-review.html">Powerbeats Pro</a> design defects prevents the wireless earbuds from charging properly. As it&#39;s reportedly too easy to lose contact between the buds and their charging case, one of the earpieces either won&#39;t charge &quot;consistently&quot; or quickly drain its charge. Apple committed fraud by misrepresenting battery life and failing to address issues it supposedly knew about, the plaintiff said.</p><p>Vivar&#39;s attorneys suggest a combination of the case design and an insufficiently sturdy ear &quot;gasket&quot; (the piece that goes into your ear) may be responsible. Customers have had to resort to inserting a &quot;wedge&quot; to keep the charging pins in contact, according to the lawsuit. The lawyers also reject Apple&#39;s claims the Powerbeats Pro are sweat- and water-resistant, arguing that sweat corrodes the charging contacts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The lawsuit calls for Apple to &quot;correct&quot; the situation, compensate affected users and pay unspecified damages.

Researchers at Northwestern University (including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engage-game-boy-211023869.html">battery-free Game Boy</a> creator Josiah Hester) have <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2022/01/fitbit-for-the-face-can-turn-any-face-mask-into-smart-monitoring-device/">developed</a> a &quot;FaceBit&quot; face mask sensor that can track a wide range of health data from inside an N95 mask. The magnetically-attached unit can gauge your heart rate using the subtle head movements from blood pumping, and can detect leaks or a poor fit by looking for sudden dips in mask resistance.</p><p>Those measurements, in turn, can help the sensor detect a slew of other conditions. Heart and breathing data could let you know when you&#39;re stressed and need a break. And while the sensor won&#39;t replace an N95 fit test (to verify a proper seal), it&#39;s capable enough to help you maintain that fit over the course of a long day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You might not have to charge the sensor, either. While there is a battery in the prototype, the sensor uses breathing force, heat, motion and the Sun to extend the mask&#39;s longevity to 11 days. Hester eventually wants the mask to be battery-free.</p><p>FaceBit will need to go through clinical trials and other tests before it&#39;s ready for real-world use. However, Hester&#39;s team has already <a href="https://facebit.health/">released the project</a> code and hardware to the public to help others build and verify it.  While you probably won&#39;t buy one of these for personal use, it could be crucial for hospitals eager to keep workers safe and prevent burnout over long shifts.</p><div id="24e5ecf3cc234d6b8c743235c72cf70e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zENpI85PDA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebit-smart-face-mask-sensor-205238551.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5048bf1-a45e-4dbb-98c4-bee1b2ae6cd2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 20:52:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642280237</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T01:58:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/16b07800-7639-11ec-b59d-12297d33e9d3" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/16b07800-7639-11ec-b59d-12297d33e9d3" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Northwestern University]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['FaceBit' smart face mask sensor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['FaceBit' smart face mask sensor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mac and Linux games leave Humble Bundle’s Trove after January 31st]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re on Humble Bundle and use a Mac or a Linux computer, you may want to download all the games you can from the service&#39;s Trove before the month ends.

The Humble Trove is a catalog of over 70 DRM-free games that you can access, so long as you have a Choice subscription.

Humble has already started <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/humblebundles/comments/s2iqka/if_youre_not_on_windows_bye_bye_trove/">sending users an email</a>, reminding them that they only have until January 31st to download games if they&#39;re not on Windows.

While there weren&#39;t specific examples, <em>NBC</em> pointed to Iran shooting down a Ukranian airliner in January 2020 (reportedly due to mistaking the jet for a cruise missile) and a Malaysian flight brought down by Russia-backed Ukranian separatists in July 2014.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>FedEx first applied for the laser system in October 2019.

It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if more commercial aircraft followed suit, even if the risks of attacks remain relatively low.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fed-ex-anti-missile-laser-proposal-182159427.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2e4bde63-9b4a-45e2-88cd-266b38319caa</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 18:21:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642270920</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T18:22:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Military & Defense]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f470d7b0-762b-11ec-bfff-29d880a5f2b8" width="5040" height="3360" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f470d7b0-762b-11ec-bfff-29d880a5f2b8" width="5040" height="3360" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[viper-zero via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Chiba, Japan - May 18, 2019:FedEx Boeing B767-300F (N104FE) freighter.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[FedEx Boeing B767-300F (N104FE) freighter.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The next iPad Pro will reportedly offer MagSafe charging and a 'brand new chip']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The murmurs of an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-with-wireless-charging-bloomberg-report-080021362.html">iPad Pro with wireless charging</a> are growing louder. <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/14/apple-hits-roadblock-in-plans-to-redesign-ipad-pro-with-magsafe/">sources</a> claim Apple is moving forward with an update to its pro tablet that would include MagSafe wireless charging, but not necessarily how you&#39;d expect. Rather than using a previously reported all-glass back (like most recent iPhones), the new iPad Pro could instead charge through an enlarged glass Apple logo built into a metal back. It would charge more quickly than an iPhone (expected given the iPad&#39;s added power draw) and carry stronger magnets to keep the charger in place.</p><p>The refreshed iPad Pro would include some more universal improvements, including a larger battery and an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a>-style camera array. There would also be a &quot;brand new chip&quot; <em>9to5</em> presumed would be the M2 also expected for a new MacBook Air. Earlier rumors suggested the M2 would have eight cores like the M1, but would run them faster and tout more graphics cores.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There was no mention of a specific timeframe for the iPad Pro update. While talk has circulated of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-se-5g-spring-2022-event-151352071.html">spring event</a>, there are no guarantees Apple will launch any new iPads in that time frame. Don&#39;t be shocked if there is a new Pro, though. The M1-based iPad Pro was as much a chance for Apple to flex its silicon prowess as it was a functional upgrade — an M2 sequel would keep that momentum going, and MagSafe support would help tie the Pro into Apple&#39;s wider ecosystem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2022-magsafe-leak-173643522.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a8ec807-adc5-41b9-8444-3af4fea44951</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 17:36:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642268204</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T01:58:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2e65990-7624-11ec-b8ad-8965dccf581b" width="3000" height="1542" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2e65990-7624-11ec-b8ad-8965dccf581b" width="3000" height="1542" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPad Pro with M1 (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPad Pro with M1 (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: The first man to listen to the birth of stars]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If the efforts of the 10,000-plus people who developed and assembled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-10-billion-james-webb-space-telescope-will-study-universe-origins-180049573.html">the James Webb Space Telescope</a> are any indication, the age of the independent scientist are well and truly over.

With hindsight, we can see that astronomy was about to be turned upside down by a revolution at least as big as the one started by Galileo’s telescope. Detecting radio waves from space marks the first time in history that humanity glimpsed the vast invisible Universe, hiding beyond the narrow window of the visible spectrum. It was a momentous occasion that was all but ignored in academic astronomy circles for one very simple reason: the world of radio engineering was just too far removed from the world of astronomy. When Jansky published his initial results he attempted to bridge the divide, spending half the paper giving his readers a crash-course in astronomy (explaining how to measure the location of things in the sky, and exactly why a signal repeating every twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes meant something interesting). But, ultimately, the two disciplines suffered from a failure to communicate. The engineers spoke a language of vacuum tubes, amplifiers and antenna voltages: incomprehensible to the scientists more used to speaking of stars, galaxies and planets. As Princeton astronomer Melvin Skellett later put it:</p><blockquote><p>The astronomers said ‘Gee that’s interesting – you mean there’s radio stuff coming from the stars?’ I said, ‘Well, that’s what it looks like’. ‘Very interesting.’ And that’s all they had to say about it. Anything from Bell Labs they had to believe, but they didn’t see any use for it or any reason to investigate further. It was so far from the way they thought of astronomy that there was no real interest.</p></blockquote><p>After Jansky had moved on to other problems, there was only one person who became interested in listening to radio waves from space. For around a decade, from the mid-1930s until the mid-1940s, Grote Reber was the only radio astronomer in the world.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grote_Reber">Grote Reber’s</a> story is unique in all of twentieth-century science. He single-handedly developed an entire field of science, taking on the task of building equipment, conducting observations, and exploring the theory behind his discoveries. What makes him unique is that he did all of this as a complete amateur, working alone outside the scientific establishment. His job, designing electric equipment for radio broadcasts, had given him the skills to build his telescope. His fascination with the scientific literature brought him into contact with Jansky’s discovery of cosmic static, and when it became clear that no one else in the world seemed to care very much, he took it upon himself to invent the field of radio astronomy. He built his telescope in his Chicago back garden using equipment and materials available to anyone. His telescope, nearly ten metres across, was the talk of his neighbourhood (for good reason – it looks a bit like a cartoon doomsday device). His mother used it to dry her washing.</p><p>He spent years scanning the sky with his homemade machine. He observed with his telescope all night, every night, while still working his day job (apparently he would snatch a few hours of sleep in the evening after work, and again at dawn after he was finished at the telescope). When he realised he didn’t know enough physics and astronomy to understand the things he was seeing, he took courses at the local university. Over the years, his observations painted a beautiful picture of the sky as seen with radio eyes. He detected the sweep of our Milky Way, with bright spots at the galactic centre (where Jansky had picked up his star-static), and again towards the constellations Cygnus and Cassiopeia. By this time he had learned enough physics to make scientific contributions, too. He knew that if the hiss from the Milky Way was caused by thermal emission – heat radiation from stars or hot gas – then it would be stronger at shorter wavelengths. Given that Reber was picking up much shorter wavelengths than Jansky (60 cm, compared to Jansky’s fifteen-metre waves), Reber should have been bombarded with invisible radio waves tens of thousands of times more powerful than anything Jansky saw. But he wasn’t. Reber was confident enough in his equipment to conclude that whatever was making these radio waves, it had to be ‘non-thermal’ – that is, it was something different from the standard ‘hot things glow’ radiation we discussed back in chapter 2. He even proposed the (correct!) solution: that hot interstellar electrons whizzing past an ion – a positively charged atom – will get sling-shotted around like a Formula 1 car taking a tight corner. The cornering electron will emit a radio wave, and the combined effect of billions of these events is what Reber was detecting from his back garden. This only happens in clouds of hot gas. Reber was, it turns out, picking up radio waves being emitted by clouds containing new-born stars scattered throughout our Galaxy. He was, quite literally, listening to stars being born. It was a sound no human had ever heard before. To this day, radio observations are used to trace the formation of stars, from small clouds in our own Milky Way to the birth of galaxies in the most distant corners of the Universe.</p><p>In many ways, Reber’s story seems like an anachronism. The golden age of independent scientists, who could make groundbreaking discoveries working alone with homemade equipment, was hundreds of years ago. With the passing of the Victorian era, science became a complex, expensive, and above all professional business. Grote Reber is, as far as I know, the last of the amateur ‘outsider’ scientists; the last person who had no scientific training, built his own equipment in his garden, and through painstaking and meticulous work managed to change the scientific world.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-invisible-universe-matthew-bothwell-oneworld-press-163035122.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">740af94f-87c0-437d-bcc2-0b88c87e434c</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:30:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642096440</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T17:54:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d0fd3dc0-7309-11ec-bcff-3c571f222f6e" width="5300" height="2981" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d0fd3dc0-7309-11ec-bcff-3c571f222f6e" width="5300" height="2981" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Joe Sohm/Visions of America via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Owens Valley Radio Observatory, OVRO, Bishop, California.

Two of iRobot&#39;s higher-end models with clean bases are on sale at Wellbots right now when you use the code <strong>ENGADGET250</strong> at checkout — both the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Roomba s9+" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm">Roomba s9+</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Roomba j7+" href="https://fave.co/3bid5zH">Roomba j7+</a> will be $250 off, bringing them down to $850 and $600, respectively.

It&#39;s thanks to this feature that the company calls the j7 a series of &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">poop-detecting</a>&quot; devices because they should be able to successfully avoid a robot vacuum&#39;s arch nemesis — your pet&#39;s accidents. iRobot&#39;s Pet Owner Official Promise (or P.O.O.P. for short) ensures that you&#39;ll get a new vacuum if the robot fails to avoid a run in with poop during your first year of ownership.</p><p>Otherwise, the j7 series sits right under the s9 series in iRobot&#39;s lineup, meaning it has a number of advanced features like 10x the suction power of a standard Roomba, dual multi-surface rubber brushes and Imprint Smart Mapping, the latter of which lets you direct the vacuum to clean only certain rooms. The &quot;plus&quot; part of the j7+ refers to the clean base, or an extended part of the dock into which the vacuum will empty its debris after every job. So instead of emptying the dustbin yourself after every cleaning, you&#39;ll only have to empty the base about once every two months. Combine that with the smart controls in the iRobot mobile app and you may only have to interact with the Roomba every so often — the app lets you do things like remote start the device, set cleaning schedules and more.</p><p>The s9+ is the most advanced device that iRobot makes and it has a few differences from the j7 series. It has 40x the suction power of iRobot&#39;s standard series of vacuums and a design that helps it clean corners better. It also has a 3D sensor that helps it detect and clean around objects, although the technology is slightly different than that in the j7 series. Both are compatible with Amazon&#39;s Alexa and the Google Assistant, too, so you can control the robo-vacs with voice commands if you wish.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-roomba-j7-poop-detecting-robot-vacuum-is-250-off-right-now-150019435.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c1a6f30-d78a-43f7-bc5c-203b54585169</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 15:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642343109</ingested><modified>2022-01-16T14:25:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will let dating apps in the Netherlands offer third-party payments]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is once again honoring regulations requiring it to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-allow-third-party-payments-south-korea-105542247.html">allow alternative payment options</a> in the App Store, although this one is highly specific. As <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-complies-with-dutch-watchdog-ruling-payment-options-netherlands-2022-01-15/">reports</a>, Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mbbs4zql">confirmed</a> it would comply with orders from the Netherlands&#39; Authority for Consumers and Markets forcing it to allow third-party payment systems in Tinder and other locally-offered dating apps. The regulator determined on December 24th that Apple had abused its market power by requiring its in-app purchasing platform, and gave Apple until January 15th to make the change if it wanted to avoid fines.</p><p>Like with past decisions, Apple wasn&#39;t happy. It contended that allowing third-party options would &quot;compromise the user experience&quot; while posing new privacy and security threats, and reminded developers they (or their payment partners) would be responsible for handling refunds and similar issues. Apple is appealing the ACM&#39;s decision and noted it would still take commissions from third-party payments.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The order doesn&#39;t affect other apps available in the Netherlands.

Officials are increasingly convinced Apple is using its in-app purchasing requirement to stifle competition, and it won&#39;t be surprising if other countries follow suit before long.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-netherlands-payment-ruling-dating-apps-145622372.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7aa84267-a77a-4185-945e-8f061b164218</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 14:56:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642284986</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T22:16:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a2ce58c0-760c-11ec-8fef-f6136d941d7a" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a2ce58c0-760c-11ec-8fef-f6136d941d7a" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yuriko Nakao via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[THE HAGUE, NETHERLANDS - JUNE 24: The Apple logo hangs outside its store on June 24, 2020 in The Hague, Netherlands.

The website has temporarily suspended his account over COVID-19 misinformation, specifically for saying masks are useless in preventing the coronavirus&#39; spread. YouTube <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/9891785">updated its rules</a> in 2020 to prohibit &quot;content about COVID-19 that poses a serious risk of egregious harm.&quot; It doesn&#39;t permit videos with medical misinformation that contradicts local health authorities, such as the World Health Organization.&nbsp;</p><p>The organization <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-masks">considers</a> wearing masks &quot;a key measure to reduce transmission and save lives.&quot; That&#39;s why YouTube explicitly states that videos containing claims that wearing masks have negative side effects and that they don&#39;t play a role in preventing the contraction or transmission of COVID-19 go against its policy. The website has suspended several creators for COVID-19 disinformation in the past, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-sky-news-australia-ban-covid-misinformation-213810128.html"><em>Sky News Australia</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-suspends-one-american-news-network-221244594.html"><em>One American News Network</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-rand-paul-suspended-covid-19-misinformation-184047586.html">Senator Rand Paul</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bongino is only getting a week-long suspension, because it&#39;s his first strike under the policy. If he gets another strike within 90 days, he&#39;ll get another two-week suspension. His channel will only be removed if he gets a third strike within three months. In addition to suspending his uploads, YouTube has also demonetized his channel for &quot;repeatedly violating [its] Advertiser-Friendly Guidelines on harmful and dangerous acts.&quot; He will, however, be able to re-apply for the Partner Program after 30 days.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it looks like Bongino has plans to keep posting about masks and their supposed failure to prevent the transmission and contraction of the virus. The <em>Bongino Report</em> website&#39;s Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/BonginoReport/status/1482129629498462212">posted</a> a copy of his email to YouTube, which tells the customer service rep that he will &quot;immediately post content on why masks have been totally ineffective in stopping this pandemic&quot; after his suspension is over. He dared YouTube to do something about it. Bongino also called the website (and, by extension, Google) a &quot;tyrannical, free speech-hating, bullshit, big tech shithole.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dan-bongino-suspended-youtube-covid-19-misinformation-133519539.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49f4cd5e-1fb6-4194-a088-85145d472336</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 13:35:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642316501</ingested><modified>2022-01-16T07:01:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/078267b0-b949-11eb-9ff9-829aa2516878" width="5482" height="3647" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/078267b0-b949-11eb-9ff9-829aa2516878" width="5482" height="3647" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roy Rochlin via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 18: Host Dan Bongino as US Open winner Gary Woodland visits "FOX & Friends" at Fox News Channel Studios on June 18, 2019 in New York City.

According to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgmjpk/linktree-banned-removed-inappropriate-use-sex-work"><em>Motherboard</em></a>, Linktree, a tool that allows you to share multiple links with one URL online, has given sex workers the boot overnight and without warning. Banned users have taken to social networks like Twitter to announce that their accounts were banned &quot;for inappropriate use&quot; and didn&#39;t even get an email or any kind of notice about it. Some were reportedly billed for the service, which costs $9 per months for the Pro tier, but weren&#39;t refunded when their account was canceled.&nbsp;</p><p>Marlene Bonnelly, Head of Trust &amp; Safety at Linktree, told the publication that the accounts that were banned shared a URL that violated its Community Standards. Bonnelly&#39;s statement reads:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Per our company&#39;s policies, the Linktree accounts banned stemmed from sharing a URL which violated Community Standards by sharing advertisements for the sale of real-life sexual services.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Sex workers make use of tools like Linktree, because some platforms don&#39;t allow linking out to adult websites such as OnlyFans directly. Perhaps more importantly, they have to diversify make use of several websites, because they&#39;ll never know when a service will suddenly decide to ban adult content.&nbsp;</p><p>Financial services like PayPal, Visa and MasterCard, have long been known <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-02-paypal-square-and-big-bankings-war-on-the-sex-industry.html">to close</a> the accounts of people in the business of sex. Patreon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-27-patreon-adult-content-crowdfunding-uncertainty.html">banned</a> content of a sexual nature back in 2017, and the number of services that decided not to host sex workers and their content have only grown since the US government <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-11-fosta-sesta-silencing-sex-workers.html">passed</a> FOSTA-SESTA a few years ago. Even OnlyFans, which has become synonymous with adult content, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-big-banks-war-adult-content-174041161.html">tried to ban</a> &quot;sexually explicit conduct&quot; in 2021 until it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-suspends-ban-on-sexually-explicit-content-132256309.html">suspended</a> its planned policy change.</p><p>Linktree&#39;s Terms of Service states that a user must not &quot;include any sexually explicit material (including pictures and language) on your Page itself or your account itself.&quot; However, it&#39;s vague and not entirely clear if linking to websites like OnlyFans has always been against its rules. It&#39;s also unclear why Linktree suddenly started banning sex workers when they&#39;d been using the service without issue for quite some time, but people in the business of sex may want to find another link-sharing tool they can use.</p><p><strong>Update 01/16/22 2AM ET:</strong> Linktree told <em>Engadget</em> that a lot of sex workers use the tool while adhering to legal and Community Standards guidelines. Advertising real life sexual services is not legal, the company said, and would have legal ramifications for the service. Bonnelly also clarified in a statement that users that were booted off will be refunded:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Linktree will be reaching out to affected paying accounts in order to sort out refunds.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/linktree-boots-sex-workers-overnight-114707878.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf74fd2e-1551-478f-9946-1d5f91c788a5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 11:47:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642316842</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T01:58:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/69507090-75e6-11ec-ac6e-5593742f7f63" width="5722" height="3576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/69507090-75e6-11ec-ac6e-5593742f7f63" width="5722" height="3576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LuckyStep48 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Abstract image of a tulip in the form of a starry sky or space, consisting of points, lines, and shapes in the form of tree, stars and the universe.

The Biden official told the network that it believes the arrest was “not related” to the situation. But some analysts have suggested otherwise, noting that this is the first first US investigation Russia has cooperated on in eight years.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/russia-captures-hacker-likely-responsible-for-colonial-pipeline-012541371.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">26a19b91-de45-4365-bd99-88b576a8dc24</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 01:25:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642209942</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T01:26:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Basic Materials Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/374b5520-759a-11ec-bbfd-83757e50b633" width="4947" height="3298" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/374b5520-759a-11ec-bbfd-83757e50b633" width="4947" height="3298" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drew Angerer via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WOODBINE, MD - MAY 13: In an aerial view, fuel holding tanks are seen at Colonial Pipeline's Dorsey Junction Station on May 13, 2021 in Woodbine, Maryland.

As may you recall, the company “paused” the release of the OTA after there were reports of the software causing calls to drop and disconnect. The issue was such that Google took the nearly unprecedented move of removing the associated factory images for that update from its developer website.</p><p>In December, the company said the software would arrive sometime in “<a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en"><ins>late January</ins></a>.” <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143968432/google-pixel-update-january-2022?hl=en"><ins>Last week</ins></a>, it pushed up that timeline to today, January 14th. “The update will be available for all devices over the following week, but exact timing may vary depending on your carrier and country,” the company said. To that point, some carriers have said they’ll begin pushing out the software starting early next week. For instance, Canadian carrier Fido <a href="https://forums.fido.ca/t5/Phones-and-Devices/OS-Upgrade-Schedule/ta-p/185669"><ins>notes on its website</ins></a> it’s targeting January 17th for the start of its rollout.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now that the update is available, it includes all the fixes Google had planned to release in December in addition to more than a dozen new ones. Among other tweaks, you’ll find a fix for an issue that had caused the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro to drop a connection to a WiFi network in certain situations. Additionally, the update addresses a bug that had caused the phones to drain their batteries faster than expected.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pro-december-update-rolling-out-230425275.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">743109d5-8f59-464e-bde8-7ecf9cc2c768</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 23:04:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642201467</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T23:05:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/82d13530-758d-11ec-9ffb-c7038c7dd0d1" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/82d13530-758d-11ec-9ffb-c7038c7dd0d1" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sam Rutherford / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pixel 6]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Pixel 6]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The FTC is reportedly investigating Meta's VR unit for anticompetitive practices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) as well as several states, including New York, Tennesse and North Carolina, are reportedly investigating Meta’s virtual reality division in relation to potential anti-competitive behavior. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-14/meta-s-oculus-unit-faces-ftc-led-probe-of-competition-practices?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>, the FTC and involved state attorneys general began interviewing third-party developers last year to find out if the company has put them at a disadvantage when they’ve tried to compete against its own software.</p><p>Some third-party developers claim Meta frequently copies their best ideas and then makes it harder for their apps to function on its headsets. Among other developers, the outlet points to the experience of <a href="https://t.co/FSUCfBSEfh"><ins>Virtual Desktop</ins></a> creator <a href="https://twitter.com/vrdesktop?lang=en"><ins>Guy Godin</ins></a>. In 2019, he added a feature to his app that allowed Oculus Quest owners to stream PC games to their headsets. Meta, then known as Facebook, reportedly threatened to delist the app if Godin didn’t remove the feature. That same year, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-oculus-link-quest-rift-vr.html"><ins>released Oculus Link</ins></a>, a feature that allows Quest users to connect the headset to their PC via a USB-C cable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s unclear how close the FTC may be to filing formal charges against Meta. The agency declined to comment on the matter for <em>Bloomberg</em>. However, what is clear is that Meta is firmly in the FTC’s crosshairs over its various acquisitions. In December, <em>The Information </em>reported the agency had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-ftc-probe-acquisition-vr-workout-app-supernatural-within-125553153.html"><ins>opened a probe</ins></a> into its proposed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-acquiring-within-supernatural-123904948.html"><ins>$400 million deal</ins></a> to buy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/supernatural-vr-workout-app-beat-saber-chris-milk-130014895.html"><em><ins>Supernatural</ins></em></a> studio Within. Separately, this week a federal judge allowed the FTC to proceed with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-antitrust-complaint-meta-cleared-214241140.html"><ins>amended antitrust lawsuit</ins></a> that seeks to undo the company’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ftc-meta-investigation-antitrust-virtual-reality-211947952.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f6285699-114b-42cf-88d2-56f858409ffe</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 21:19:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642195189</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T02:01:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/381b0e60-2446-11eb-b5fe-a84cf288dbf8" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/381b0e60-2446-11eb-b5fe-a84cf288dbf8" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US residents can order free, at-home COVID-19 tests starting on January 19th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One year, 10 months and eight days after the World Health Organization declared the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/covid-19/">COVID-19</a> pandemic, Americans will be able to order free, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/find-out-if-you-have-covid-from-the-comfort-of-your-own-home-173043438.html">at-home tests</a> from the government.
