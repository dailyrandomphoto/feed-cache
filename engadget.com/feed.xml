In July, it sought fans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-buds-pro-lab-182246111.html">test an upcoming model</a> without disclosing too many details. Fast forward a few weeks, and the company has formally revealed the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:OnePlus Buds Pro" href="https://fave.co/3Ba807L">OnePlus Buds Pro</a>.</p><p>OnePlus has adopted a different design from the original Buds, which it released last year. The Buds Pro boast adaptive noise cancellation (ANC), which filters out background sound levels of up to 40dB. You can lower that to a maximum of 25dB to keep closer tabs on your surroundings. There&#39;s a scene detection feature too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Each earbud has a trio of microphones. OnePlus says the mics work in concert with its noise reduction algorithms and a mechanical design intended to tamp down wind noise. All of those features are included with the aim of delivering clearer audio.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s also a feature called OnePlus Audio ID, a sound profile that customizes each song based on the wearer&#39;s sensitivity to different sounds, as established by a listening test. You can expect Dolby Atmos support too.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bb545d10-fa09-11eb-bebd-29cec944b194" alt="OnePlus Buds Pro" data-uuid="1cc9a813-8f3d-3769-b389-50c394e74d13"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>You&#39;ll get up to seven hours of use on a single charge, and five hours if ANC is enabled, OnePlus says. The charging case can add up to 31 hours of playback time, and an extra 23 hours if you use ANC. Fast charging adds 10 hours of playback after 10 minutes of charging time via a USB-C cable. The case is also Qi-certified for wireless charging.</p><p>The earbuds are IP55-rated for water and sweat resistance, while the charging case is IPX4-rated. Other features include low latency for gaming on certain OnePlus phones (around 94ms), fast pairing, voice assistant support, automatic pausing when you take the buds out of your ears and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">Zen mode</a> that can play white noise.</p><p>The original $79 OnePlus Buds <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-buds-hands-on-specs-price-availability-143007708.html">didn&#39;t exactly blow us away</a>. Engadget Senior News Editor Billy Steele found the AirPods-style earbuds delivered muddy audio and were uncomfortable to wear. Here&#39;s hoping OnePlus has upped its game this time around.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:OnePlus Buds Pro" href="https://fave.co/3Ba807L">OnePlus Buds Pro</a> will go on sale in the US and Canada on September 1st in two colors: Matte Black and Glossy White.

Last December, Universal Music Publishing Group bought up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/arts/music/bob-dylan-universal-music.html">Bob Dylan’s entire discography</a> in a deal estimated at more than $300 million. Similarly, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/stevie-nicks-sells-stake-in-songwriting-catalog-11607095635">Stevie Nicks sold an 80 percent share of her works</a> to Primary Wave Music for an estimated $100 million that same month. But as all this money changes hands for the industry’s biggest stars, one songwriting startup has plans to open the firehose of music royalties to the everyman.</p><p>“You see these huge deals, like the Bob Dylan deal with the publishing rights and all this money,” Alex Mitchell, co-founder and CEO of Boomy told Engadget. “It started with a recognition that most people are going to be left out of that and it caused us to have a conversation about equity in the music industry, &#39;how do we fairly remunerate artists, what&#39;s the role of labels,&#39; there&#39;s just chaos happening in the music industry right now.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mitchell realized that one major obstacle keeping amateur musicians from becoming published musicians was a technological one. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-29-beginner-home-music-studio-bedroom-producer-guide.html">Setting up a home recording studio is no small task</a>, and teaching oneself how to navigate the hyper-granular control schemes of professional-grade DAWs (digital audio workstations) like Ableton Live or Pro Tools can take months, if not years, to fully master. But what if you had an AI-based co-writer to handle the heavy technical lifting instead, similar to what Tik Tok and Instagram do for their creators?</p><p>“We really started looking at what it takes to draw creativity out of somebody, what kind of tool can you put in their hands — where there&#39;s so much of the process that&#39;s semi- or fully-automated — that they can just add their own layer of humanity to it.” What they came up with was <a href="https://boomy.com/">Boomy</a>.</p><p>“There&#39;s already AI being used in studios and in the music creation process,” Mitchell said. “A great example of this is <a href="https://www.izotope.com/en/memberships.html">Ozone auto-mastering</a>. They have used artificial intelligence to be able to create great mixes, put great final polish on tracks, things like that.”</p><p>“So what we&#39;ve done is we&#39;ve taken a lot of those concepts and we&#39;ve rewritten this stuff from the ground up,” he continued. “[It’s] less to think about how people usually make music, and more in the context of, if somebody doesn&#39;t have any skills at all, how fast can we get them making some stuff that they think is pretty cool?”</p><p>The web-based app is, essentially, a one-button music studio. Users can compose wholly original songs in around 5 to 10 minutes simply by clicking Create Song from the homepage, selecting the desired style of beat — whether that’s rap, lo-fi, experimental or “global grooves” — and then fiddling with the composition and mix until they’re satisfied. That song can then be uploaded to any of 40-plus streaming and social platforms where the song’s author can earn royalties based on the number of times their song is played.</p><p>Embedded below is a loopable, meditative jingle I put together during the course of my research. Despite my inherent lack of rhythm and general disinterest in music production, I found this to be a rather relaxing and enjoyable experience. After choosing the underlying beat and waiting a half-minute for the AI to generate a mix, the production process largely involved just shuffling icons around to adjust the composition and fiddling with dropdown menus to the instrument sets until I got something that I liked and think vaguely resembles the Konami menu screen music I grew up with. The entire process took less than 10 minutes.</p><div id="eb3a8259da87451f868b5d89cbedf0d2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/AL9rb5K5bt">https://t.co/AL9rb5K5bt</a></p>— Andrew Tarantola (@Terrortola) <a href="https://twitter.com/Terrortola/status/1428787534633439238?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Unlike recurrent neural network analysis models such as OpenAI or Google’s Magenta which, for example, can analyze Michael Jackson songs to be able to recreate the King of Pop’s signature sound, Boomy is not trained on copyrighted works. This is due in part because of the highly-segmented nature of copyright law, which varies drastically between nations and territories, but also because of the black box nature of such systems. If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem">the infinite monkey theorem</a> is any barometer, there is always a chance (albeit tiny) that a system trained on Michael Jackson might randomly spit out a perfect recreation of “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOnqjkJTMaA">Thriller</a>.” And that’s very bad for the system’s designer.</p><p>“If I&#39;m a music publisher and I own the rights to Michael Jackson,” Mitchell said. “I&#39;m going to look at that model I&#39;m gonna say ‘great, you know what, that&#39;s all mine’… if you&#39;re making a copy of somebody else&#39;s work, even if it&#39;s transformed, you&#39;re probably going to owe some publishing on that.’”</p><p>Instead, the team is taking a bottom up approach, leveraging previous experience in A&amp;R research to train its AI in building beats and compositions from scratch. “We have some really advanced algorithms that are doing automatic mixing, deciding what sound should go together — what are the features of those sounds, how do those fit together, what is the perceived loudness rate of those sounds,” Mitchell explained.</p><p>Those features grew from a brute-force development approach — putting together various combinations of beats and compositions, then presenting them to beta testers. “In our first iteration of our model had a 98-percent rejection rate, but a 2-percent stay rate,” he continued. “And in that 2 percent, over millions of sessions, we started saying, ‘okay, here are groups of features that go well together.’”</p><p>Mitchell doesn’t view Boomy simply as a music creation tool, but as a means to achieve “​​the ideal world that we want to create,&quot; one which would allow creators anywhere on the planet to register themselves as a co-writer of their work alongside Boomy at their local publishing rights organization. However, because copyright law varies from country to country, Boomy has established an alternative way to ensure that songwriters get paid for their creative works.</p><p>“So what we&#39;re saying here is, a real world example would be, we just built a music studio, we filled it with great equipment, and spent millions of dollars building the studio,” Mitchell told Engadget. “You can come in and use it for free, make whatever you want, and on your way out,  we&#39;re assigning you to our label, and we&#39;re going to give you an 80 percent rev share on everything we collect from what you made in the studio.”</p><p>“The IP vests with us,” he continued, noting that Boomy has been used to create more than 3 million songs to date, “which actually makes us, ironically, the largest record label in the world.” For users who are either already established musicians or otherwise want to obtain sole ownership of their songs, ”they can submit a rights request, and we can basically either sell the copyright to them or come to some other arrangement.”</p><p>While Mitchell could not share exact figures with Engadget, he did estimate that in the two years since Boomy’s launch, the company has paid out “tens of thousands&#39; &#39; of dollars in royalties to its user base.</p><p>Moving forward, Mitchell foresees Boomy’s UI to add more additional control features and composition inputs, “over the next several months, we&#39;re really gonna focus and double down on vocal, melody and top line,” he explained.</p><p>The company is also working on new methods to earn royalties for its users. “We’ve got a bunch of influencer groups lined up and we&#39;ve been doing some stuff behind the scenes to place tracks into YouTube videos,” Mitchell continued. “If you&#39;re a creator, or if you&#39;ve got a podcast, rather than <em>go pay</em> for music rights, why not <em>get paid</em> for the music that you&#39;re using?”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ai-music-startup-boomy-looks-to-turn-the-record-industry-on-its-ear-190037786.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f567a2e-d2cf-47d3-9821-375d37d96449</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 16:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629721575</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T12:26:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/89af2c20-01e5-11ec-be3c-7957cb2328c7" width="5120" height="2880" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/89af2c20-01e5-11ec-be3c-7957cb2328c7" width="5120" height="2880" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[freestylephoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DJ android, disc jockey robot pointing and playing music on turntables, cyborg on stage with deejay audio equipment, 3D rendering]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DJ android, disc jockey robot pointing and playing music on turntables, cyborg on stage with deejay audio equipment, 3D render]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google is shutting down the Android Auto phone app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Android Auto is best known as a way to access your phone through a car&#39;s dashboard — this lets you easily access Google Maps, music apps and data without needing to use your phone. But for years now, Google has also offered an Android Auto experience <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-07-android-auto-standalone-app-launch.html">directly on a phone</a>, for people who don&#39;t have a compatible dashboard unit. More recently, Google has also been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-assistant-driving-mode-215249421.html">working on an &quot;Assistant driving mode&quot;</a> (pictured above) that arrived earlier this year after a few delays. Now that Google Assistant driving mode is finished, though, the company will stop offering the old Android Auto experience on phones running Android 12.</p><p>A statement from Google <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/17/android-auto-phone-screen-stops-working/">shared with<em> 9to5Google</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>confirms this plan. Google Assistant driving mode is our next evolution of the mobile driving experience,&quot; the statement reads. &quot;For the people who use Android Auto in supported vehicles, that experience isn’t going away. For those who use the on phone experience (Android Auto mobile app), they will be transitioned to Google Assistant driving mode. Starting with Android 12, Google Assistant driving mode will be the built-in mobile driving experience. We have no further details to share at this time.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before Google confirmed this change, some Pixel owners running Android 12 received a notification when trying to run the Android Auto app on their phones. It said that Android Auto was now &quot;only available for car screens&quot; and recommended that they try the Google Assistant driving experience instead. Given that the new Google Assistant experience will clearly be the focus going forward, switching over probably isn&#39;t a big deal for most people. But if you don&#39;t upgrade your phone to Android 12, you&#39;ll be able to keep running the Android Auto app, at least for the time being.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-auto-phone-app-shutting-down-130020711.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aeae1acb-89f5-4917-9e68-42f1ac1a810e</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 22 Aug 2021 13:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629725202</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T13:26:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34d7eb50-02b3-11ec-bf33-6986941684b7" width="1893" height="1051" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/34d7eb50-02b3-11ec-bf33-6986941684b7" width="1893" height="1051" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Assistant for driving mode]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Assistant for driving mode]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SiriusXM launches music channel dedicated to TikTok hits]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can&#39;t escape viral <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-limits-teen-access-130931754.html">TikTok</a> songs.

The first color hand-held it might have been, but its small library of games (under 100 official titles) and general mishandling by Atari itself earned it little more than a walk-on role in gaming history for most people. As such, the homebrew and indie scene for the Lynx is pretty thin compared to its contemporaries (the Game Boy and the Game Gear).</p><p>The system still has its fans, though, (me included) and a few dedicated folks still hold a candle for the chonky handheld, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-21-wyvern-tales-lynx-homebrew-jrpg-irl.html">new titles</a> now more common than they were a decade ago. But the <em>real </em>rarity is the full, physical release. Here are four new games you can play on original hardware, complete with cartridge and box, just as nature intended.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For Lynx diehards, there’s one destination to gather: <a href="https://atariage.com/">AtariAge</a>. And user Fadest (real name, Frédéric Descharmes) is one of the long-standing members of the handheld’s forum there. He’s perhaps best known for his Yastuna series of <a href="https://yastuna-games.com/en/atari-lynx/25-the-alchemy-of-cubes.html">puzzle games</a>. His two new releases keep the puzzle trend, but with a shoot-em-up/adventure twist.</p><p>Descharmes began programming for the Lynx as a way to channel his enthusiasm for retro gaming while he soothed his son to sleep late at night. He came to the Lynx specifically for its technological limitations (although it was advanced for its time). “I like the NES and Game Boy, and even code for them, but in my beginner situation, the Lynx was probably the best choice when I started in 2004,” he told Engadget.</p><p><a href="https://yastuna-games.com/en/atari-lynx/24-raid-on-tri-city-second-wave.html"><em>Raid on TriCity - Second Wave</em></a></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/61ff33b0-01c6-11ec-bffc-94e39240d675" alt="Raid on Tri City - Second Wave for the Atari Lynx" data-uuid="d318ab87-82b3-30ea-9c0d-af10169610c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fadest</div></figure><p><em>Raid on TriCity</em> takes the classic Tetris format and introduces a shoot-em-up component. As the blocks fall, you can’t move them or rotate them, but you can shoot them away brick by brick. You score, as normal, by completing lines (and not by shooting), and some of the Tetrominoes contain power-ups or enemies/ways to die.</p><p>Descharmes already released a pay-what-you-want ROM-only version of <em>Raid on TriCity</em>. “Second Wave” is essentially the same game as a physical release with some new in-game perks. The two most important ones would be the addition of an EEPROM for storing progress/high scores (no retail Lynx games ever had batteries or memory like some Game Boy titles did) and a new story mode which injects some life into an otherwise pick-up-and play time killer.</p><p>As simple as the game may sound, the hybrid dynamic picks the best elements of both genres and blends them to great effect. As you see blocks falling you have to make a quick decision about whether you want to go for a complete line, or whether a power-up might be more appealing or perhaps you have to sacrifice one to get rid of a baddie behind it. Sometimes this can be a bit of a gamble if a power-up you want has blocks above it that might bring you closer to the upper threshold and thus the end of the game.</p><p>Likewise, as lines complete and bring any power-ups above it one row down, a helpful bomb can become a death sentence (bombs trigger when a line is completed<strong>&nbsp;</strong>taking anything one square around it along with it — including your spaceship if you’re not careful).</p><p>The story mode isn’t exactly its own adventure, more it serves as a way to break up the game play with some narrative interludes and an element of interactivity in choosing your “path” through a network of levels. The levels themselves are really just more of the same shoot-a-block business, but it makes it feel more like making progress, and thus a game with an end to reach (rather than a high score to beat).</p><p><a href="https://yastuna-games.com/en/atari-lynx/22-asteroids-chasers.html"><em>Asteroid Chasers</em></a></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c23be3e0-01c6-11ec-bffb-c64baa997a51" alt="Asteroid Chasers for the Atari Lynx" data-uuid="c3f69aad-a3f2-3d53-a5cc-4e313e94688c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fadest</div></figure><p>Fadest’s second new title is another puzzler, but this time it’s more about strategy and fortune. I say fortune, but it’s usually mis-fortune to be fair. The game looks like it’s going to be a retro space shooter at first glance, but is more akin to a card game. Each turn you’ll be presented with an item/card and can only place it one square away in any direction from your last move. But each item/card will either be a scoring opportunity or a penalty of some kind.</p><p>This simple premise is deceptively addictive. There are four main “cards” to place: A probe, an asteroid (two types!) a mine or a pirate ship. Your job is to surround the asteroids with four probes to earn points (hence the game’s name). However, the pirates have other ideas and will disable any probes adjacent to them. This not only robs you of points, but can also be fatal: mines are diffused by surrounding them with probes, and you can only have three “live” ones on the map at any time. This means an ill-placed pirate, or just a string of bad luck with many mine cards can end your mission in a snap.</p><p>The goal is simple, reach the end of the “deck” while scoring as many points as you can along the way. At first, the game feels frustrating, as if you are merely at the whim of whatever cards are in the pile. And while this is true, you soon learn some strategies to increase your chances of getting to the end and racking up some points to boot.</p><p>For me, the fun of the game is built right into that frustrating nature. Many times I was killed early on, which only stoked my desire to beat the game and make it to the end. Once you do, you find yourself wanting to then beat your own high score. As with <em>Raid on TriCity</em>, <em>Asteroid Chasers</em> can remember your high scores giving the game longer term appeal. There are also many achievements to unlock (fortunately, also remembered) which will reward you with different music and other goodies giving this relatively simple game a lot more longevity than it first suggests.</p><h3>Songbird Productions</h3><p>If you’ve paid any attention to Atari’s handheld or the Jaguar indie scene in the last 20 years, you’ll be familiar with Songbird Productions. Not only is it a popular retailer of rare and homebrew games, its founder, Carl Forhan, is responsible for a number of Lynx titles being saved from obscurity by finding unfinished IP and seeing them through to completion, along with some original titles of his own.</p><p>One such title is <em>CyberVirus</em>, a first person space shooter. “In <em>CyberVirus</em>, I had to redo all the missions, redo the health and powerup system, and add new features to the game which were not in the original prototype.” Forhan told Engadget.

The first version was released almost 20 years ago and is one of the “unfinished” games that Songbird rescued. It’s also a rare first-person/3D shooter on the Lynx. <em>Lost Missions</em> is a collection of levels that were also in the original, developed initially by Beyond Games, and presented to Atari as a demo back in 1993.</p><p>The nine new missions see you take on a familiar cast of robotic foes as you seek to achieve your objective. This could be as simple as destroying some communication towers, but the number of enemies soon ramps up making each mission exponentially harder. You have a selection of weapons at your disposal and a semi-open 3D world to explore, not bad for a console released in 1989.</p><p>CV-TLM will appeal to fans of early first person shooters like <em>Doom</em>, but instead of a complex map you must navigate open terrain. Thank’s to the game’s origins, the graphics and gameplay are much nearer to those found in official releases (given that this nearly was one) compared to even some of the more ambitious homebrew titles that have emerged since the Lynx’s commercial demise.</p><p>The result is a fun, frantic shooter that deserved to make it onto shelves back in the &#39;90s. Forhan’s given the game the next best thing in this release which comes with a slick, glossy box and a physical cartridge that’s indistinguishable from the originals (many homebrew releases, including the above are 3D printed).</p><p><a href="https://songbird-productions.com/product/unnamed/"><em>Unnamed</em></a></p><div id="6c8f3473672d4e9cb00eb3a7ce31fda6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgSwFMKSWcI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The catalog of official releases for the Lynx tends to skew toward arcade titles, puzzlers and racing games. There’s a little bit of everything for sure, but adventure games and RPGs are generally lacking. <em>Unnamed </em>is a welcome salve, then, for fans of either of those genres. While the game is published by Songbird, it’s the work of Marcin Siwek who’s other Lynx title — <a href="http://totheunseen.kylos.pl/hg/unseen.html"><em>Unseen</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>— was a dark, choose your own adventure style game. Siwek’s second title is much more immersive with your onscreen character free to move around, find items and solve puzzles.</p><p>You awaken in a strange place with no memory of how you got there. Your task is to figure out why and how they find themselves in this strange world. Along your journey you find new rooms to explore and items to help you along the way. It’s a classic recipe, but one that lends itself particularly well to the handheld format.</p><p><em>Unnamed </em>is refreshing, not just for its playstyle, but as a true indie game (rather than a rescued abandoned title) it has a surprising amount of depth and atmosphere. Within moments of playing, I knew that this is a game that I would truly want to “get into” and complete. As with Descharmes‘ titles, <em>Unnamed </em>features an EEPROM for saving progress meaning you can pick it up without having to start from scratch every time.</p><p>The graphics are a good blend of cute and sinister and the music strikes the perfect balance of ambiance without being a distraction. The challenges and puzzles to be solved are pitched just at the right level and there’s a genuine sense of wondering if you might have missed something — which might sound annoying, but I think is the hallmark of a good RPG.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/atari-lynx-four-new-physical-games-183055733.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43dbb31e-ab28-4324-8ccf-ec9a5d49c291</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 20:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629558853</ingested><modified>2021-08-21T15:14:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3f555ab0-01cb-11ec-95de-fcf7f693d9bb" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3f555ab0-01cb-11ec-95de-fcf7f693d9bb" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[New Atari Lynx games]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[New Atari Lynx games]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[First look: Cadillac’s luxury EV debut seems like a winner]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="1515e0a843fa4f5dae26b1850fc89944"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l3utXrXvmFE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>As parent company GM begins its rollout of EV’s based on the Ultium battery platform, automaker Cadillac is readying its very first electric Caddy, the Lyriq, for production.

Cherlynn Low spent some time with the Galaxy Z Flip 3 to determine who it’s really for. Terrence O’Brien compared and contrasted the Pixel 5a against previous versions to find out where the value lies in the upgraded model. Cherlynn also put the ASUS-Qualcomm Snapdragon smartphone through its paces to see how it stacks up against mainstream devices.</p><h2>The Galaxy Z Flip 3 is now <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html">in the same price range as regular flagships</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a255b890-01e8-11ec-98dd-64816f12051f" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-uuid="243f6279-f8a0-3b72-8ff4-741a60b4ca45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low was upfront about the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Z Flip 3" href="https://fave.co/3gch6c6">Galaxy Z Flip 3</a> in her review. Not only is it the best foldable phone yet with a fast, large screen, neat software tricks and water resistance, but it’s also now available at a (relatively) reasonable $1,000. She says it’s basically a regular smartphone that folds in half with a satisfying snap. The stronger aluminum, refined hinge and tough screen made it the first foldable she was willing to throw into a purse without worrying about scratching. She liked the widgets available for the Cover Display window, the new color options and the Flex mode, which assisted with one-handed use.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite that, she still feels the Z Flip 3 is a hard sell. The battery life was woefully short and rarely lasted an entire day, and the software was a bit buggy. While most apps fit nicely on the screen, there was an occasional mismatch of aspect ratios that caused difficulties. For example, the pop-up dialogs in <em>Settlers of Catan </em>disappeared into the edges of the display. Plus, it was hard to find the benefit for more mainstream audiences who could purchase an iPhone or Samsung handset for the same price. For those who are nostalgic or curious enough to buy the Z Flip 3, they ‘ll find themselves with a capable device that has the best any foldable can offer.</p><h2>Google’s Pixel 5a is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">an incremental (and somewhat boring) update</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f2a45860-01e8-11ec-a72a-a04ffd5920b1" alt="Google Pixel 5a" data-uuid="7d3c6a5e-ce4a-31fb-9e6a-599347857814"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien is quick to point out that the <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_5a_5g?hl=en-US">$449 Pixel 5a</a> is a bit of a stop-gap: The Pixel 4a 5G was a solid offering and the Pixel 6 should be right around the corner. That being said, there’s still a few things about the 5a that make it worth considering. While the 5a keeps the same processor, RAM and camera experience as the previous version, it adds IP67 water and dust resistance and an incredible battery. Terrence said the 4,680mAh battery survived through nearly 23 hours of video play before powering down, and was still at 40 percent after 24 hours of general heavy usage.</p><p>The rest of the features on the 5a include a metal unibody with a matte texture, an upgrade to Gorilla Glass 6 and a 6.34-inch OLED panel with HDR support and 2,400 x 1,080 resolution. Terrence admits that the Snapdragon 765G processor is a bit outdated, but also says that the 5a still felt responsive and quick while reading email or playing <em>The Elder Scrolls: Blades. </em>However, it stuttered a few times while navigating YouTube and editing photos. The camera experience is also excellent, though the same as the features on the 4a 5G: an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, a 12.2-megapixel main lens and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle. Overall, Terrence’s biggest objection to the 5a was that it was a bit boring in that it’s very close to a reproduction of the 4a 5G.</p><h2>The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-for-snapdragon-insiders-review-140014488.html">truly isn’t for everyone</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/18b8e160-01e9-11ec-bffa-ac03ce015c64" alt="Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders" data-uuid="0137e639-e049-3625-9d3d-5eb957b784ad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Qualcomm and ASUS teamed up to create a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:smartphone" href="https://fave.co/37XhKFP">smartphone</a> for fans of the Snapdragon chipset, but Cherlynn Low says it&#39;s a bit too niche to broadly recommend. With a 6.8-inch screen and weighing in at 210 grams, this is one of the heavier phones that she’s tested recently — and its looks differentiate it from the competition. Cherlynn says its rounded-rectangle body, matte blue finish and shiny red accents make it stand out, but she was less fond of the illuminated icon on the rear which can glow on and off.</p><p>The rest of the $1,499 device includes a 144Hz refresh rate display, comprehensive 5G support and rapid charging. The AMOLED panel runs at a resolution of 2,448 x 1,080 and delivers vibrant colors and deep blacks. However, the 20.4:9 aspect ratio cut off some content like the ends of longer messages in Telegram. The phone includes a pair of wireless Master and Dynamic earbuds to pair with Qualcomm’s High Dynamic Range Audio Record to support high-res 24-bit 96kHz audio. However, there were several features that had yet to be released, and the phone did tend to run hot. Cherlynn says unless you’re a <em>big</em> Qualcomm fan or really need the refresh rate, you’ve got better options elsewhere.</p><h2>Loupedeck Live is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loupedeck-live-versus-the-stream-deck-170020781.html">control surface ideal for desktop apps</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4411d5b0-01e9-11ec-aded-190ddf22a41a" alt="Loupedeck Live" data-uuid="d2832d11-fc0d-3802-96dc-d2f48adb4272"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>First, James Trew wants you to understand what the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Loupedeck Live" href="https://amzn.to/3y83Xqm">Loupedeck Live</a> is: a Mac or PC control surface with multiple configurable dials and buttons. He also wants you to understand what it’s best for, which is audio- or image-editing and a workflow of dynamic profiles. When using these profiles, the Loupedeck will automatically switch to the assigned buttons and rotaries you’ve selected for that program. This means the Live is adaptive and will follow you with a variety of actions and choices as you navigate.</p><p>That puts it in contrast to the competition, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Elgato Stream Deck" href="https://amzn.to/2W4LwpS">Elgato Stream Deck</a>, which works as more of a program launcher. The Loupedeck Live offers three models of control surface with each being physically distinct and intended for different uses; James says the Live version looked good on his desk. He particularly liked the mini LCD displays on the buttons, which show what each does, and the rotary dials, which he found useful for volume control or scrolling through a list. James felt the particular strength of the Loupedeck was the large amount of native-app support it offers — not only can it be helpful for streaming, but it will also lend a hand when editing or designing a logo.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-open-and-close-the-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-smartphone-160006766.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83939644-5886-41bb-ae73-733a12cc2705</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 17:15:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629558798</ingested><modified>2021-08-21T15:13:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bd8ba9d0-01e8-11ec-9f7e-794b7a8c5e52" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bd8ba9d0-01e8-11ec-9f7e-794b7a8c5e52" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ICYMI: We open (and close) the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google has already discontinued the Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a with 5G]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google just released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">excellent and relatively inexpensive Pixel 5a</a>, and the company has also already given us a look at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro</a>. So you could easily guess that the Pixel 5 is not long for this world, and you&#39;d be right. According to a statement <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/pixel-5-4a-5g-discontinued-after-5a-launch/">received by <em>DigitalTrends</em></a><em>, </em>Google is done selling the Pixel 5 as well as the Pixel 4a 5G.&nbsp;</p><p>“With our current forecasts, we expect Google Store in the U.S. to sell out of Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5 in the coming weeks following the launch of Pixel 5a (5G).

And since the Pixel 5a is only being sold in the US and Japan, at least for starters, Google will be going without a 5G-capable phone in other markets until the Pixel 6 arrives.&nbsp;</p><p>That situation will likely be remedied soon: Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-5g-182238671.html">announced the Pixel 5</a> on September 30th last year, so it seems likely that we&#39;ll get an official reveal of the Pixel 6 sometime in the next month, as well. Google&#39;s Pixel phones have never exactly sold like gangbusters, but it&#39;s still somewhat surprising to see them pull the Pixel 5 so quickly in areas where they aren&#39;t seeing the 5a. But given that Google is already showing off the Pixel 5&#39;s successor, chances are good most people would wait that extra month to get the the company&#39;s next flagship. As the first phone with Google&#39;s own custom silicon, it&#39;s definitely a lot more intriguing than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">somewhat stale Pixel 5</a> anyway.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-discontinued-161225173.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">56c464d1-b599-4976-b882-ad1cd7529475</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 16:12:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629721507</ingested><modified>2021-08-23T12:25:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4d8a5e70-0291-11ec-ad5f-e93424dc3ff6" width="3000" height="1622" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4d8a5e70-0291-11ec-ad5f-e93424dc3ff6" width="3000" height="1622" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How Tesla engineers solved the problem of exploding EV batteries]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Between CEO Elon Musk&#39;s often erratic antics, strident competition from existing industry titans, and a public that is still not fully sold on the idea of traveling via electrical charge, Tesla&#39;s road to prominence has not been a smooth one.

AC Propulsion had learned this the hard way months earlier, in one of an increasing number of incidents that sent shudders through the battery industry. En route from Los Angeles to Paris, a shipment of AC Propulsion’s batteries caught fire as it was being loaded onto a FedEx airplane while it refueled in Memphis, triggering an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board and prompting concerns about how to transport batteries in the future. Personal electronics companies, such as Apple Inc., were recalling devices with lithium-ion batteries out of concern they could overheat and catch fire. In 2004 and 2005, Apple recalled more than 150,000 laptops — with batteries made by LG Chem.</p><p>When LG Chem realized it had sold a large number of its batteries to a Silicon Valley startup that planned to use all of them for a single device — a car, as it happened — its legal department sent a letter demanding the cells be returned. The battery maker didn’t want to be associated with a potentially fiery experiment.</p><p>[Tesla&#39;s first CEO, Martin] Eberhard ignored the request. He had little choice. His bet that Tesla would be able to find a ready battery supplier was proving harder to cover than expected. Without these batteries, there might not be a second chance to get more.</p><p>Amid all of the attention on lithium-ion batteries, [Tesla Co-Founder/CTO, JB] Straubel thought back to his former house in LA, where he and [Tesla employee number 7, Gene] Berdichevsky celebrated the idea of an electric car by setting cells afire. If struck with a hammer, they put on quite a show. Cars were always in danger of that kind of impact, but there was also a more insidious threat. He began to wonder what might happen if one of the cells in the tightly packed cluster that would form a car’s battery pack got too warm.</p><p>One day in the summer of 2005, he and Berdichevsky decided to find out. With the office cleared out for the day, they went to the parking lot with a brick of cells — a cluster of batteries glued together. They wrapped one of the cells with a wire that would allow them to heat it remotely. Then, from a safe distance, they flicked the heater on. The individual cell quickly rose to more than 266 degrees Fahrenheit (130 degrees Celsius), causing the battery to flash into a blinding flame as the temperature spiked to 1,472 degrees, then explode altogether, sending the remaining skin of the battery into the sky like a rocket. Then another cell in the pack caught fire, launching into the air. Soon all of the cells were on fire. <em>Bang. Bang. Bang.</em></p><p>Straubel recognized the implications of his amateur pyrotechnics. If an incident like the one he cooked up were to happen in the wild, it could spell the end for Tesla. The next day, after they disclosed their experiment to Eberhard, they showed him the scorched pavement, pitted with holes from the night before. Eberhard urged them to be more careful, but he couldn’t deny that more testing was needed. He gathered the team at his rural house on the hills above Silicon Valley for more experiments. This time, they dug a pit and put a brick of cells in it, then covered it with plexiglass. They heated one of the cells and again the batteries ignited, causing a chain of explosions. Straubel had been right: this wasn’t good. They needed outside help to understand exactly what they were dealing with — the team needed battery experts.</p><p>Days later, a small group of battery consultants were gathered with what at first seemed like a manageable message: Yes, even the best battery manufacturers produced a random cell that would have a defect, causing it to short and catch fire. But the odds were remote. “It happens really, really infrequently,” one of the consultants said. “I mean like between one in a million and one in ten million cells.”</p><p>But Tesla planned to put about 7,000 cells in a single car. Sitting near Straubel, Berdichevsky pulled out his calculator and computed the likelihood that a cell in one of their cars might catch fire by chance. “Guys, that’s like between one in 150 and one in 1,500 cars,” he said.</p><p>And not only would they be churning out cars with defective batteries that, if ignited, could set off a chain reaction, but their cars could be detonating in the garages of the richest of the rich—burning down mansions and lighting up local TV news. The mood in the room shifted. The questions became more urgent: Was there anything that could be done to avoid defective cells?</p><p>Nope. Random cells were always going to get too hot and spark thermal runaway — basically an explosion sparked by overheating.</p><p>Straubel and the team returned to their work deflated. The stakes couldn’t have been higher for Tesla. This wasn’t just about solving a hard problem, one that threatened to drain limited resources and derail development of the Roadster. If they forged a solution that seemed to work, only to see Tesla vehicles catch fire in years to come, the company would be doomed. And it would be a failure not just for Tesla; their dreams of the electric car could be set back a generation. They could not only cause injury or death, they might kill the electric car in the process.</p><p>If they wanted to truly become an automaker, they had to face the challenge that GM, Ford, and others had been dealing with for a hundred years: They had to ensure they were putting safe cars on the roadway. A solution to thermal runaway could amount to a true breakthrough, one that would set Tesla apart from the auto industry for years to come. Using lithium-ion batteries had seemed like a smart idea, one that a number of thinkers had alighted on. But figuring out how to use them without turning the car into a ticking time bomb could be their greatest innovation.</p><p>They stopped work on all aspects of the Roadster project and formed a special committee to find a solution. The team set up whiteboards, listing what they knew and what they needed to learn. They began running daily tests. They’d configure a battery pack with the cells spaced differently, to see if there was an ideal distance for containing chain reactions. They tried different methods of keeping the batteries cool, such as having air flow over them or tubes of liquid brush past them. They’d take the packs to a pad used by local firefighters for training and ignite one of the cells to better understand what was taking place.</p><p>The danger of the situation was driven home while en route to one of those tests. Lyons, their recruit from IDEO, began to smell smoke coming from the back of his Audi A4, where he had loaded a pack of test batteries. It was a sign that a cell was heating up and approaching thermal runaway. He immediately stopped and yanked the batteries out of the car and threw them to the ground before his car could catch fire — a close call.</p><p>Eventually, Straubel began to narrow in on a solution. If they couldn’t keep a cell from warming, maybe they could keep it from reaching the point where it set off a chain reaction. Through trial and error, the team realized that if they had each cell lined up a few millimeters from its neighbor, snaked a tube of liquid between them, and dumped a brownie-batter-like mixture of minerals into the resulting battery pack, they could create a system that contained overheating. If a defective cell within began to overheat, its energy would dissipate to its neighboring cells, with no individual cell ever reaching combustibility.</p><p>Where just months earlier they had been struggling to set up a workshop, now they were on to something utterly new. Straubel was thrilled. Now he just needed to figure out how to convince the battery suppliers to trust them. Straubel was hearing from Eberhard that the established manufacturers weren’t interested in their business. As one executive at a supplier told Eberhard: You guys are a shallow pocket. We’re a deep pocket. If your car blows up, we’ll probably get sued.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-power-play-tim-higgins-penguin-randomhouse-153052075.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">84c69033-b971-4706-921c-92be29eb8177</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 15:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629501957</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T23:26:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/327de810-ff79-11eb-bd9d-5ab9fdc4c80d" width="4000" height="3000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/327de810-ff79-11eb-bd9d-5ab9fdc4c80d" width="4000" height="3000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Koehler via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERSTELAND, GERMANY - MARCH 02: A Tesla Model 3 plugged in and charging at a Supercharger rapid battery charging station for electric vehicles in Bersteland, Germany, on March 02, 2021.

Now, the automaker has <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-joe-biden-business-health-environment-and-nature-bbe51b0c8e644c4448d634fc3c0f3461">expanded</a> the recall to cover all Bolt EVs and Bolt EUVs sold worldwide, starting from the first model up until the latest ones. This recall covers 73,000 additional vehicles, 60,000 of which are in the US, on top of the first batch of recalled Bolts.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon investigating the initial incidents, GM found a manufacturing defect in the Bolt&#39;s batteries manufactured at an LG Chemical Solution plant in South Korea. That became the basis for the models the automaker included in the first recall. AP reports that GM started investigating the newer Bolts after a 2019 model that wasn&#39;t included in the recall last year caught fire in Chandler, Arizona a few weeks ago, bringing the total number of battery-related fire incidents to 10. The company found that batteries made in LG&#39;s other sites could also suffer from defects, hence the recall expansion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>GM will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-replace-chevy-bolt-battery-modules-fire-risk-100027066.html">replace</a> all five battery modules for models 2017 to 2019, while only defective modules will be replaced in newer vehicles. All fresh modules installed will come with a new eight year, 100,000 mile warranty. Until owners can get their cars in for module replacement, GM is advising them to limit charging to 90 percent of the battery capacity and to park outdoors. (The company previously determined that the vehicles that went up in flames were almost fully charged.) An email sent to owners contained a link to <a href="https://my.chevrolet.com/how-to-support/safety/boltevrecall">instructions</a> on how to do just that by using the Target Charge Level mode. The automaker is also advising owners to charge their vehicle more frequently to avoid depleting their battery until there&#39;s less than 70 miles of remaining range.</p><p>This second batch of recalls will cost the company $1 billion in addition to the $800 million it&#39;s had to spend for the first one. Further, it remains to be seen how it would affect GM&#39;s EV push. In June, the automaker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-self-driving-ev-investment-35-billion-035316455.html">increased</a> its combined EV and self-driving investment from 2020 through 2025 to $35 billion, in hopes that it can have 30 electric vehicles on the market by the end of 2025 and that it can exclusively sell EVs by 2035. For now, the company said it will stop producing and selling Bolts until it determines that there are no longer problems with LG&#39;s batteries.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-expands-fire-risk-recall-all-chevy-bolt-115934063.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af905ee3-fcd7-463c-871d-1858a10b962d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 11:59:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629547180</ingested><modified>2021-08-21T11:59:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/151533b0-026b-11ec-9f5d-06b039cc0b7d" width="1600" height="1008" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/151533b0-026b-11ec-9f5d-06b039cc0b7d" width="1600" height="1008" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chevrolet]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[2022 Chevrolet Bolt EV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Chevrolet]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[California judge finds Prop 22 gig worker measure unconstitutional]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A California judge has ruled that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-voters-reaffirm-that-uber-drivers-are-indeed-employees-091216147.html">Proposition 22</a>, the measure that allows companies like Uber and Lyft to keep classifying app-based drivers in the state as independent contractors, is unenforceable and unconstitutional. According to the <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/Prop-22-the-gig-worker-exemption-for-Uber-and-16401915.php"><em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></a>, Alameda County Superior Court judge Frank Roesch found that Prop 22 illegally &quot;limits the power of a future legislature to define app-based drivers as workers subject to workers&#39; compensation law.&quot;</p><p>Proposition 22 passed by a wide margin in the state when most people voted in favor of it in last year&#39;s November elections. Companies were legally obligated to classify gig workers as full-time employees under Assembly Bill 5 A (AB5), which was passed in 2019, but some (like the aforementioned ride-sharing firms) continued to treat them as contractors. Uber, Lyft, Instacart and DoorDash poured over $220 million into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-drivers-sue-prop-22-popups-194405188.html">campaigning</a> for Prop 22 in order to overturn AB5, and the move clearly worked.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The measure requires gig companies to provide their contractors with healthcare subsidies and a wage floor, but it also exempts them from having to classify their workers as employees with appropriate benefits and protections. While those in favor of the proposition argue that it would allow workers to keep their independence while enjoying benefits they didn&#39;t have before, not everyone&#39;s happy with the development. A group that includes the Service Employees International Union and the SEIU California State Council <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rideshare-drivers-challenge-prop-22-california-223019411.html">sued California</a> earlier this year to overturn the proposition.&nbsp;</p><p>In his ruling, Roesch specifically singled out Section 7451 of the measure, which states that any future law related to collective bargaining for app drivers must comply with the rest of the proposition. &quot;It appears only to protect the economic interest of the network companies in having a divided, ununionized workforce, which is not a stated goal of the legislation,&quot; he wrote in his decision. He also found it unconstitutional that any amendment to the measure requires a seven-eighths vote of approval to pass in the state Legislature.</p><p>If the ruling stands, gig companies like Uber and Lyft may have to spend hundreds of millions paying for healthcare and other additional benefits for their drivers. At the moment, though, Prop 22 is still in effect, and gig companies are already planning to appeal. An Uber spokesperson told <em>The Chronicle</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This ruling ignores the will of the overwhelming majority of California voters and defies both logic and the law. We will appeal and we expect to win. Meanwhile, Prop. 22 remains in effect, including all of the protections and benefits it provides independent workers across the state.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-judge-finds-prop-22-unconstitutional-043822868.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">35c3dc55-1131-4252-b96a-30f0fddb63bf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 21 Aug 2021 04:38:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629520706</ingested><modified>2021-08-21T04:38:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Referenda]]></category><category><![CDATA[Local Elections]]></category><category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/2aa89790-0c8f-11ea-bf93-5fc6d8839547" width="4379" height="2921" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/2aa89790-0c8f-11ea-bf93-5fc6d8839547" width="4379" height="2921" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrei Stanescu via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[August 21, 2019 San Francisco / CA / USA - UBER headquarters in SOMA district; Uber Technologies, Inc. is an American multinational transportation network company (TNC)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[UBER headquarters in SOMA district, San Francisco]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rhythm game 'Tetris Beat' is now available on Apple Arcade]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the nearly 40 years since Alexey Pajitnov created <em>Tetris</em>, the game has inspired many permutations.

The company says it has built new kinds of exercises to help folks get to grips with the character-based languages.</p><p>Meanwhile, five more languages are coming to the app soon: Haitian Creole, Zulu, Xhosa, Tagalog and Maori. Duolingo worked with South African organization Nal&#39;ibali on the Zulu and Xhosa courses.&nbsp;</p><p>“For years, we’ve been working to elevate the status of South African languages by creating and distributing high-quality stories for children,&quot; Nal’ibali COO Katie Huston said in a statement. &quot;Partnering with Duolingo to create these courses is another step towards elevating and protecting our local languages, and sharing them with new audiences around the world.&quot;</p><p>Duolingo is also working on an app that teaches elementary-level math. The app will harness the same tech the company uses for language learning and it should emerge next year. On top of that, Duolingo is upgrading the BirdBrain AI learning system. It says the AI will create personalized lessons at the correct difficulty level.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/duolingo-family-plan-more-languages-math-app-200429512.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce2cf848-abe4-4a95-8431-272292af6309</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 20:04:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629488143</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T19:35:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0792e5e0-01ec-11ec-95f7-7c116b5c1705" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0792e5e0-01ec-11ec-95f7-7c116b5c1705" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Duolingo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Duolingo Family Plan]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Duolingo Family Plan]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Peloton's Android app hints at long-rumored rowing machine]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Conducting an APK teardown of the latest version of the Peloton Android app, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/20/peloton-app-confirms-rower-prepares-scenic-waterways/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> found evidence the company is preparing the software to support a rowing machine in the near future.

In a development update, 343 Industries said campaign co-op and Forge won&#39;t be available at launch, as the studio is focusing on the single-player campaign and multiplayer modes.</p><p>&quot;Unfortunately, as we focused the team for shutdown and really focused on a quality experience for launch, we made the really tough decision to delay shipping campaign co-op for launch,&quot; Halo Infinite head of creative Joseph Staten said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yct2QKgF5e4">in the video</a>. &quot;We also made the tough call to delay shipping Forge past launch as well.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5179453bc46a48af907e14955284d800"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yct2QKgF5e4?rel=0&amp;start=999" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>343 Industries will roll out the modes next year as part of its seasonal roadmap. Right now, the plan is to release campaign co-op in season two (around three months after the game debuts) and Forge in season three (approximately six months after launch). Those plans may change though.</p><p>&quot;Our number one priority is making sure that whatever we ship, whenever we ship it, it meets the right quality bar across all platforms,&quot; Staten said. &quot;When we looked at these two experiences, campaign co-op and Forge, we made the determination they&#39;re just not ready.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Campaign co-op has long been a staple of the Halo series, with up to four people being able to tackle the main campaign together. In Forge, players can create custom game modes with modified maps and unique rules.&nbsp;</p><p>The delays will likely come as a disappointment to fans, who&#39;ve already had to wait longer than expected for the next game in the flagship Xbox franchise. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-director-steps-down-183805905.html"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> wasn&#39;t ready in time for the Xbox Series X/S launch last November. As such, Microsoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-delay-2021-193546027.html">delayed the game</a> until <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-update-release-date-235826926.html">a year after</a> it was initially supposed to arrive.</p><p>As for the specific <em>Halo Infinite </em>release date, Staten said 343 Industries plans to announce that soon. Along with the single-player campaign, there&#39;s a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-multiplayer-beta-110518513.html">free-to-play multiplayer mode</a>. You&#39;ll just have to remain patient a bit longer if you want to play through the campaign with your buddies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-forge-release-date-343-industries-190153091.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ef3f3cba-fe83-41e8-9ffb-02b9ab621a3d</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 20 Aug 2021 19:02:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629486128</ingested><modified>2021-08-20T19:02:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/38b44370-7840-11eb-9dff-c6bc9a7d303a" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/38b44370-7840-11eb-9dff-c6bc9a7d303a" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[343 Industries/Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Halo Infinite' screenshot of Zeta Halo]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Halo Infinite' screenshot of Zeta Halo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[China's new user data protection law goes into effect on November 1st]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>China has passed a new data protection law, according to the country’s <a href="http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-08/20/c_1310138698.htm"><em><ins>Xinhua</ins></em><ins> state media outlet</ins></a>.
