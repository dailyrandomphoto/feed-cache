The Federal Trade Commission <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2021/12/ftc-sues-block-40-billion-semiconductor-chip-merger">has sued</a> to block the merger over concerns the $40 billion deal would &quot;stifle&quot; competition for multiple technologies, including datacenters and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-mercedez-benz-autonomous-vehicle-computer-173014585.html">car computers</a>. ARM is a &quot;critical input&quot; that fosters competition between NVIDIA and rivals, the FTC said, and a merger would give NVIDIA a way to &quot;undermine&quot; those challengers.</p><p>The FTC was also worried NVIDIA would have access to sensitive info from ARM licensees. The merger could reduce the incentive for ARM to develop tech that might run counter to NVIDIA&#39;s business goals, officials added. The administrative trial is due to start August 9th, 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company didn&#39;t appear bothered. NVIDIA characterized the lawsuit as the &quot;next step&quot; in the FTC process, and repeated its arguments in favor of the buyout. The acquisition would &quot;accelerate&quot; ARM&#39;s product plans, foster more competition and still protect the chip architecture designer&#39;s open licensing model, according to NVIDIA. You can read the full statement below.</p><p>Despite the claims, an FTC lawsuit is a huge issue for NVIDIA. The Commission files lawsuits like these when it believes a company is breaking the law — concessions might not be enough. It also comes after the European Commission launched an investigation into the purchase in October. NVIDIA is facing questions from major regulators clearly wary of the acquisition, and those agencies might not accept the answers.</p><p>As it stands, NVIDIA&#39;s competition likely isn&#39;t happy. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-objects-nvidia-arm-purchase-191827082.html">Qualcomm reportedly objected</a> to the ARM deal in communications with the FTC (among other bodies) over fears NVIDIA might refuse to license designs. And when heavyweights like Apple, MediaTek and Samsung also depend on ARM, it&#39;s doubtful the rest of the market would be enthusiastic. At the least, the trial would likely delay closure of the union past NVIDIA&#39;s original 2022 target.</p><blockquote><p>As we move into this next step in the FTC process, we will continue to work to demonstrate that this transaction will benefit the industry and promote competition. NVIDIA will invest in Arm’s R&amp;D, accelerate its roadmaps, and expand its offerings in ways that boost competition, create more opportunities for all Arm licensees and expand the Arm ecosystem. NVIDIA is committed to preserving Arm’s open licensing model and ensuring that its IP is available to all interested licensees, current and future.</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ftc-lawsuit-nvidia-arm-212113933.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9d876f9-e037-48f2-9178-517c379fdba2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 21:21:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638480075</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T21:21:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/84b927b0-a129-11eb-b71a-4b83711de0d7" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/84b927b0-a129-11eb-b71a-4b83711de0d7" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[POLAND - 2021/04/08: In this photo illustration a Nvidia logo seen displayed on a smartphone with stock market percentages in the background.

The Wear OS device would be an eye-catching device with a round display, but no physical bezel — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">Galaxy Watch 4</a> might seem antiquated by comparison.</p><p>Rohan would be a relatively typical smartwatch on the inside with a heart rate sensor and a battery that would still require daily charging. It would use proprietary watch bands, so you&#39;d have to forget about using conventional straps. A tipster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22814461/google-pixel-watch-wear-os-2022-rohan">talking</a> to <em>The Verge</em> claimed the watch would &quot;cost more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-review-eda-stress-blood-oxygen-specs-price-130048259.html">a Fitbit</a>&quot; and serve as an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Apple Watch</a> competitor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The software may be the most important feature. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">Pixel phones</a>, Rohan would serve as a &quot;showcase&quot; for Google&#39;s platform — in this case, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-wear-os-3-update-release-date-160045459.html">Wear OS 3</a>. The smartwatch (not necessarily called &quot;Pixel Watch,&quot; despite the name floating around) would theoretically show customers what Wear OS can do, and give hardware partners a reference point to work from. It might also include a Fitbit tie-in, nicknamed &quot;Nightlight.&quot;</p><p>Google has already declined to comment, citing a policy of not commenting on rumors or speculation. However, the concept might not be new. Google supposedly axed its first attempt at an official watch in 2016 and instead has put its trust in third-party offerings from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">Fossil</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-04-lg-g-watch-r-review.html">LG</a> and others. It&#39;s moving forward now that it has not only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-now-owns-fitbit-141747501.html">finished acquiring Fitbit</a>, but has reportedly merged its wearable team with Fitbit&#39;s and otherwise tried to replicate Apple&#39;s focus on health.</p><p>A first-party watch might be necessary. Apple continues to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/smartwatch-shipments-surge-q2-2021-171751707.html">dominate the smartwatch market</a> despite a flurry of low-cost hardware and competition from major brands like Samsung and Garmin. Some of this has been blamed on lackluster Wear OS hardware, not to mention a lack of significant OS updates. An official Google watch won&#39;t necessarily up-end the marketplace, but it could spur other watchmakers to try harder and add some (arguably needed) excitement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-watch-smartwatch-release-date-211045180.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1154c3aa-063e-45a5-866c-a324b604b7fd</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 21:10:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638479447</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T21:11:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6a3a75b0-53a8-11ec-b7f9-6fcff2b24494" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6a3a75b0-53a8-11ec-b7f9-6fcff2b24494" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 4]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SoundCloud's Playback compiles your favorite jams from 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that everyone you know on social media has shared their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html"><ins>Spotify Wrapped</ins></a> year-in-review, SoundCloud would like you to know it too has a chronicle of what you listened to over the last 11 months.

Additionally, Google has added a directory option that allows clinics to list the languages the staff at their office speak. With today’s launch, there’s support for 12 languages, including Spanish and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fingerspelling-xyz-asl-app-162411505.html">ASL</a>. Lastly, the company now allows healthcare providers to update their Google Business Profile. They can do so by claiming their listing, which should help them ensure important information about their hours and services are accurate.</p><p>All of those may seem like small additions, but they’re ones that should help make healthcare more accessible for more people. If you’re someone who depends on your Medicare, there’s nothing more frustrating than showing up at a doctor’s office or clinic only to find out they don’t accept your plan. Similarly,  a language barrier can often make a significant difference in healthcare outcomes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-search-175919995.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2487f290-f501-4b0f-86fa-dfd2c0d87911</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 17:59:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638467963</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T17:59:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7efed600-5397-11ec-bfec-f192bb8c06e3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7efed600-5397-11ec-bfec-f192bb8c06e3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Search tool]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Search tool]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adidas's first foray into the metaverse will likely include NFTs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nike isn&#39;t the only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nike-roblox-nikeland-metaverse-192234036.html">sportswear brand dabbling</a> in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverses</a>.

The Unicode Consortium <a href="https://home.unicode.org/emoji/emoji-frequency/">says</a> the top 10 most-used emoji are <a href="http://blog.unicode.org/2019/10/the-most-frequent-emoji.html"><ins>mostly unchanged from 2019</ins></a> (the group didn&#39;t release a list last year).</p><p>The Tears of Joy (😂) emoji reigned supreme again.

It was also the top emoji in 2019 and the <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/insights/2020/spending-2020-together-on-twitter"><ins>most tweeted one last year</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Unicode Consortium said the only emoji that gets close to the popularity of Tears of Joy is the Red Heart ❤️. The rest of this year&#39;s top 10 most-used emoji, which mostly have positive vibes, are:</p><ul><li><p>🤣 - Rolling on the Floor Laughing</p></li><li><p>👍 - Thumbs Up Sign</p></li><li><p>😭 - Loudly Crying Face</p></li><li><p>🙏 - Folded Hands (aka the prayer emoji)</p></li><li><p>😘 - Face Blowing a Kiss</p></li><li><p>🥰 - Smiling Face With Three Hearts</p></li><li><p>😍 - Smiling Face with Heart-Shaped Eyes</p></li><li><p>😊 - Smiling Face with Smiling Eyes</p></li></ul><p>It seems most of us aren&#39;t super creative in our emoji use. The top 100 account for around 82 percent of total emoji shares, even though there are more than 3,600 to choose from, not to mention <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-gboard-android-emoji-kitchen.html"><ins>the mashups on Gboard</ins></a>.</p><p>Smiling faces and hand-based emoji are generally very popular, as are the plant-flower and emotion (i.e. hearts) categories. The least popular emoji category is flags. Country flags are used the least, even though there are more emoji in that category than any other and the Summer Olympic Games, one of the biggest demonstrations of national pride, took place this year.</p><p>Given that we&#39;ve been enduring a pandemic for almost two years, it&#39;s not too surprising that there&#39;s been a rise in the use of health-related emoji. Even so, only 🥵 (Hot Face) and 🥴 (Woozy face) made it into the top 100 this year — 🦠 (Microbe) squeaked into the top 500. After all, instead of using a specific emoji depicting sickness, many people are likely to just say they&#39;re feeling like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-signal-founder-poop-emoji-151740121.html"><ins>💩</ins></a>.</p><p>It&#39;s heartening to know that despite the turmoil the humanity has endured lately, our emoji use trends toward happiness, love and positivity.

The rocket will have a &quot;Hungry Hippo&quot; fairing that&#39;s part of the first stage design — they simply open when releasing the second stage, and close again when it&#39;s time to land. That should save money, as you might guess, but it also promises faster turnaround times and lighter second stages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tapered shape of the rocket itself is built for reusability with a wider, more stable base. Neutron won&#39;t need a launch tower or girder to take off, Rocket Lab said. The company previously said the machine could carry up to eight metric tons to low Earth orbit versus the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocket-labs-electron-makes-successful-return-to-flight-after-failed-launch-070809406.html">Electron&#39;s</a> modest 0.3 tons (660lbs).</p><p>Any practical uses are still distant. Rocket Lab said it was still in the midst of a &quot;competitive process&quot; to pick a production facility, launch site and engine test facility on the US East coast. The firm previously said it hoped for a first flight in 2024. Even so, the new details are important — they hint at a future where Rocket Lab carries more (and more varied) payloads at lower costs, making space that much more accessible.</p><div id="4e866d7ba5ad4e8f9a408d9e79e888b6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7kwAPr5G6WA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rocket-lab-neutron-details-150747277.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1c9b17f5-cf25-41fb-a379-4966efe59903</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 15:07:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638458141</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T15:15:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c65f1b80-537a-11ec-afff-fa112d208c49" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c65f1b80-537a-11ec-afff-fa112d208c49" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rocket Lab]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rocket Lab Neutron vehicle opening its fairings]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rocket Lab Neutron vehicle opening its fairings]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MagSafe battery pack is 24 percent off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For those that want easy wireless charging on the go, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple&#39;s MagSafe battery pack" href="https://amzn.to/3xKTxhQ">Apple&#39;s MagSafe battery pack</a> is a good option if you have one of the latest iPhones. But of course, like most other Apple accessories, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-battery-pack-175601349.html">palm-sized battery</a> is expensive, coming in at $99. But Amazon has the pack for the lowest price we&#39;ve seen it right now — only $75, or 24 percent off its normal price. Now&#39;s a good opportunity to grab it if you&#39;ve been eyeing it for a while for your own iPhone, or you need a stocking stuffer for an iPhone user in your life.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xKTxhQ" id="4e74ed1faee84cf99e1bb59d07c9ff10" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MagSafe battery pack at Amazon - $75</a><p>Like all MagSafe accessories, this battery pack is designed to snap onto the back of your iPhone and it&#39;ll automatically start charging the handset once attached. It fits neatly onto the backside of even the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13 mini</a>, so you can still easily use your phone with one hand while powering up. If you plug in the battery pack while charging your iPhone, you&#39;ll get up to 15W of power and you could get even faster charging when you pair your Lightning cable with an adapter higher than 20W. Plus, you&#39;ll be able to keep track of your phone&#39;s and the battery pack&#39;s recharge on your iPhone&#39;s lock screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s pretty tempting (and often convenient) to go for Apple&#39;s own accessories, but you can often find similar, more affordable options elsewhere. While the number of MagSafe-compatible gadgets is growing, there are still only a few battery packs made by reputable brands. Anker makes two 5,000mAh magnetic power packs, a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:standard one" href="https://amzn.to/3luk3qN">standard one</a> and a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:newer MagGo model" href="https://amzn.to/3ofoHuA">newer MagGo model</a> that has a built-in, foldable kickstand, so you can prop up your iPhone while charging.

We haven&#39;t tested any of these alternatives yet, but both Anker and Belkin have a good track record when it comes to mobile accessories — plus, all three battery packs come in between $50 and $60 each, making them even better options for those with tight budgets.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-magsafe-battery-pack-is-24-percent-off-at-amazon-141038263.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">777585d1-601b-4cf5-93c1-2858d0bd9004</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 14:10:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638453006</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T13:50:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a4f836d0-e402-11eb-b77f-32ac984a1efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a4f836d0-e402-11eb-b77f-32ac984a1efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 12 MagSafe Battery Pack]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 12 MagSafe Battery Pack]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook will force users at risk of being hacked to enable two-factor authentication]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has taken steps to ensure that users most at risk of being hacked don&#39;t lose their accounts to bad actors. The social network has updated its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-security-monitoring-two-factor-keys-152613046.html">Protect program</a> that was designed to provide extra security features to human rights activists, politicians, journalists and other at-risk users. In a press call with reporters, Facebook announced that it&#39;ll start requiring users part of the program to switch on two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</p><p>The website will start implementing the new rule over the coming months all over the world — for members in the US, the requirement will take effect sometime in mid-to-late February. Facebook explained that it worked on making the enrollment and use of two-factor on its website &quot;as frictionless as possible for these groups of people by providing better user experience and support.&quot; It admitted that it may take time for all users to be able to comply with the new rule, since not everyone actively uses its platform. But Facebook and its parent company seem to be pleased with what they&#39;d seen in early testing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta&#39;s head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;So far, it&#39;s actually going very, very well we&#39;re seeing well above 90% of people successfully enabling ahead of that mandatory period.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Facebook first tested Protect back in 2018 and offered it to American politicians ahead of the 2020 US Elections. It expanded the program&#39;s scope and opened it up to more users after that— in my case, I was locked out of my account until I activated it. The website is now on track to make the program available in more than 50 countries by the end of year, including the US and India, where <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268136/top-15-countries-based-on-number-of-facebook-users/">most</a> of its users are based.</p><p>Gleicher said over 1.5 million users had enrolled in the program so far, and 950,000 had already switched on 2FA. He also said that 2FA is an underutilized feature on the platform, with only 4 percent of the website&#39;s monthly users enabling it. Even so, there are no plans to require people outside of the Protect program to switch it on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-2-factor-140044867.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c1bee97b-3b00-4dc0-b281-396b5d8d0db8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 14:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638444238</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T11:24:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b0815230-535a-11ec-8fff-39a5b893c699" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b0815230-535a-11ec-8fff-39a5b893c699" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charnchai via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Businessman use cell phone and working on office desk and analyzing new project of accounting finance.

The company has partnered with artists, session players and others who created &quot;inspiring playable instrument loops, vocal hooks, one-shots, and soundscapes,&quot; along with a story behind the sounds. You can then use those samples in any way you like to create your own tracks.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://landr-1.wistia.com/medias/wodors0shs?wvideo=wodors0shs">Chromatic</a> is as much about the interface as the capability, according to LANDR. It gives users access to content across genres of music through color-coded mood boards, so you can &quot;quickly audition or earmark individual sound sets&quot; and incorporate them into your workflow. At the same time, they&#39;re matched to the tempo and key of any project.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;As an instrument, Chromatic lets you explore, play, and manipulate original sounds created by artists and producers, making them your own,&quot; says LANDR CEO Pascal Pilon in a statement. &quot;We&#39;ve developed Chromatic to bring the human element back into your virtual studio, a unique way to collaborate and engage with the creators of your favorite tracks and musical styles.&quot;</p><p>Artists who contribute the loops will receive royalties for when they&#39;re used. However, for certain specific artists and labels, LANDR will support splits on works created with their sound sets. &quot;With this unique arrangement, Chromatic will serve as a foundation for emerging producers to collaborate with featured artists, resulting in a split release and promotion of a new work made with their Chromatic content.&quot; This presumably means that Chromatic users would share royalties on commercial releases with select, high-profile loop creators.&nbsp;</p><p>Chromatic is LANDR&#39;s first instrument, and a move towards a trend of subscriptions toward virtual instruments. A recent example is Output, which recently unveiled a similar subscription-based product called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcade-20-note-kits-instruments-sampler-hands-on-161548233.html">Arcade</a>. <a href="https://www.antarestech.com/product/auto-tune-unlimited/">Auto-Tune</a> also offers a subscription, and Splice <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splice-new-creator-plans-with-exclusive-plugins-and-educational-videos-123418413.html">recently launched</a> two vocal VST plugins that are behind subscription walls, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Chromatic is <a href="https://www.landr.com/en/chromatic?utm_campaign=awareness_chromatic_en_us_pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=organic_referral&amp;utm_source=pr&amp;utm_content=rps&amp;utm_term=professionals">now available</a> as a free download with access to the full library of royalty-free sound sets at $10 per month. It&#39;s also offering an &quot;<a href="https://www.landr.com/en/pricing/">All Access Pass</a>&quot; at $10 per month for six months and $15 per month thereafter, with royalty-free access to the sample library, AI-assisted mastering, music distribution on sites like Spotify, Sessions collaboration and more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 12:16PM ET: </strong>This post originally described Chromatic as a DAW, but we have updated the post to clarify it&#39;s a virtual instrument.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/landrs-chromatic-lets-you-create-using-artist-generated-loops-140038379.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2ce76d47-50b9-4865-8c66-87034a0042d5</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 14:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638465603</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T17:20:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b694140-5372-11ec-96b7-b3cac4b9f94b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b694140-5372-11ec-96b7-b3cac4b9f94b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LANDR]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LANDR's Chromatic DAW app lets you create using artist-generated loops]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LANDR's Chromatic DAW app lets you create using artist-generated loops]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla is selling a $1,900 Cyberquad ATV for kids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-made-a-cyberwhistle-and-its-already-sold-out-101040559.html">Tesla</a> has <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberquad-for-kids">started selling the Cyberquad</a>, but it&#39;s not the ATV it previewed when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-22-cyberquad-electric-atv-cybertruck-tesla.html">unveiled</a> its electric truck in 2019.

B&amp;N CEO James Daunt has also said the company plans to revive the range, so keep a look out for more new Nooks in the coming months.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/barnes-and-noble-nook-glowlight-4-e-reader-191526217.html"><strong><ins>Continue Reading.</ins></strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/urtopia-ebike-is-the-most-tech-heavy-weve-seen-140046298.html"><ins>Urtopia e-bike is basically a computer on wheels</ins></a></h2><h3>It’s a tech-heavy e-bike from China.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/urtopia-ebike-is-the-most-tech-heavy-weve-seen-140046298.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e6620780-5361-11ec-9d1a-d3716bfcd0fc" style="height:436;width:675;" alt="Image of the Urtopia e-bike.

Chinese brand Urtopia, however, has decided to make a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/urtopia-ebike-is-the-most-tech-heavy-weve-seen-140046298.html"><ins>futuristic rideable</ins></a> with features you’d expect to see on a car. That includes an integrated display, fingerprint reader, GPS, 4G, an integrated alarm and mmWave sensors for nearby vehicle detection.</p><p>Sadly, James wasn’t able to try some of those features on the prototype he rode, and control of the lights is voice only, which is problematic when you’re on a busy highway. That said, his overall review was positive, with the light weight, fun riding style and added features putting the gloss on a very good bike. Worth saying, however, is that the Indiegogo pre-order price of $2,000 is likely to skyrocket when the hardware is retail ready, so if you’re eager, dive in soon.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/urtopia-ebike-is-the-most-tech-heavy-weve-seen-140046298.html"><strong><ins>Continue Reading.</ins></strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html"><ins>Spotify&#39;s 2021 Wrapped is here to chronicle your year in music</ins></a></h2><h3>With color-coded Audio Auras and a quiz about your listening habits.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/182b3cf0-5362-11ec-beaf-a6737f149dd0" style="height:455;width:675;" alt="Image of an example Spotify Wrapped." data-uuid="bc78d6b0-4e89-3a8a-9bf8-ea69fd19dba1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Spotify</div></figure></a><p>It’s December, and that can only mean one thing: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html"><ins>Spotify Unwrapped</ins></a> is upon us, allowing us to humblebrag (or not) about our music taste.

Now, it&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23689535011&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkId=7635a48c60ffd1a60ba56260b8140678&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">adding</a> two new specific Alexa sound detectors for &quot;water running&quot; and &quot;appliance beeping&quot; that can be used to set up routines or reminders. It also rolled a number of other new features for things like prescription refills, ultrasound motion detection and more.&nbsp;</p><p>It was already possible to have Alexa identify those two specific sounds, but the new update means you won&#39;t have to bother training it. With the new features, you can use the Alexa app to send a notification when the washer beeps to indicate your laundry is done. It can also remind you to turn off the sink of someone accidentally leaves the water running.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along the same lines, the update includes the introduction of ultrasound motion detection for routines on select Echo devices. At its September event, Amazon said that a feature would arrive to fourth-gen Echo and Echo Dot devices, designed to use an &quot;inaudible ultrasound wave&quot; to detect if there are people in a room. With the new routines, you can use Alexa to turn on lights when motion is detected near the device, for instance, or lower the thermostat when no motion is detected.&nbsp;</p><p>Another new feature allows Amazon Pharmacy customers to ask Alexa to refill prescriptions and get proactive updates when they&#39;re delivered. &quot;You can also ask Alexa to call Amazon Pharmacy to connect with an Amazon Pharmacy customer care representative who can answer questions on topics like prescription status, account, billing, and also drug information and side effects,&quot; Amazon said.&nbsp;</p><p>Other new features include &quot;preference teaching&quot; that lets you teach Alexa which food or sports you like, dining suggestion (&quot;Alexa, what should I eat?&quot;), a TikTok video launcher, conversation mode (&quot;Alexa, join the conversation&quot;) and hands-free audio calls using Verizon Number share. Amazon also announced that customers can now pre-order the Echo Show 15 and have it ship on December 9th. The new features are now rolling out to Alexa devices, though some may be region-limited.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-alexa-can-tell-you-if-your-washing-machine-stops-or-water-is-running-102043428.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06f443de-7b09-4ba8-95c0-948b4c37022d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 10:20:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638440446</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T10:20:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fbc76d50-5351-11ec-abae-0d8f7205dcb3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fbc76d50-5351-11ec-abae-0d8f7205dcb3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon's Alexa can tell you if your washing machine stops or water is running]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon's Alexa can tell you if your washing machine stops or water is running]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's 2021 App Store Awards highlight 'connection']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-best-apps-games-2020-zoom-disney-plus-genshin-impact-disco-elysium-202554793.html">Apple focused on quarantine life </a>for its App Store Awards. For 2021, it&#39;s continuing that concept with a focus on &quot;connection&quot; as its trend of the year — basically, things that brought us together even though we&#39;re still dealing with a global pandemic. That trend award was bestowed upon five apps, including familiar names like <a href="https://bumble.com/">Bumble </a>and <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/"><em>Among Us</em></a><em>!.</em> But the niche winners are even more interesting: there&#39;s <a href="https://www.eatokra.com/">EatOkra</a>, an app that helps you find black-owned restaurants; <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>, which helps anyone create pro-grade designs; and <a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/">Peanut</a>, a social network focused on connecting women to find support throughout major life events.</p><p>You&#39;d probably be surprised by some of the winners for Apple&#39;s mainstay categories too: the Apple TV app of the year was the boxing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/dazn-live-sports-streaming/id1129523589">streaming service Dazn</a>, something I&#39;ve admittedly <em>never</em> heard of. The Apple TV game of the year, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/space-marshals-3/id1501495423"><em>Space Marshals 3</em></a>, also came out of seemingly nowhere. But the strong review scores for both of those apps make it clear that users genuinely enjoy them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the App Store Awards are very much a marketing exercise, it&#39;s also a useful way to highlight some of the best apps users may have missed.

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-02/apple-tells-suppliers-iphone-demand-has-slowed-as-holidays-near"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the tech giant has told its component suppliers that demand for its biggest moneymaker has weakened just before the holiday season.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in October, the organization <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-poised-to-slash-iphone-production-goals-due-to-chip-crunch?sref=10lNAhZ9">reported</a> that Apple lowered the lineup&#39;s production goal to 80 million units — 10 million less than its original target — due to the lack of parts. However, the company was expecting to make up for the loss next year when component supplies are set to improve. Now, Apple has reportedly told its suppliers that the orders it was expecting to get next year might not materialize at all.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The global chip shortage has had significant effects on companies across industries, forcing tech companies and automakers to significantly slash their production targets. In addition to lowering the iPhone 13&#39;s production goals, Apple reportedly chose to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cuts-ipad-production-feed-chips-iphone-13-nikkei-2021-11-02/">cut back on the iPad&#39;s</a> production to be able to allocate more chips for its new phones. But some potential buyers may already have decided to skip this generation altogether after they were faced with lengthy wait times and lack of stocks at retailers. Especially since reports suggest that the iPhone 14 will be a major upgrade and will represent a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-redesign-leak-152422684.html">complete redesign</a> of the company&#39;s mobile devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the weakening demand, analysts are still expecting Apple to reveal a sales increase of 6 percent in the final three months of 2021.

And it’s that expansion from that the rebranding is designed to encapsulate.</p><p>“We built the Square brand for our Seller business, which is where it belongs,” Dorsey said. “Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same. No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy.”</p><p>The move comes in the same week that Dorsey stepped down as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-ceo-step-down-150532889.html"><ins>CEO of Twitter</ins></a>.

As <em>CNBC</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/facebook-ends-ban-on-cryptocurrency-ads.html">reports</a>, Meta has greatly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/expanding-eligibility-to-run-ads-about-cryptocurrency">loosened</a> its ban by expanding the number of regulatory licenses it accepts from three to 27.

He spent roughly two years trying to launch Meta&#39;s cryptowallet Novi, so far succeeding only with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-will-test-cryptocurrency-wallet-novi-in-small-pilot-210320677.html">small test run</a>.
