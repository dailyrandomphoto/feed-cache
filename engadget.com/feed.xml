Apple&#39;s thin-and-light laptop is on sale for $850 right now, or $150 off its normal price. The base model has been hovering at $900 on Amazon for the past few months, likely to stay competitive with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-student-discounts-140038070.html">Apple&#39;s education pricing</a> during the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/back-to-school-gift-guide-2021/">back-to-school</a> season, but this is the first time since a brief moment at the end of July that we&#39;ve seen the Air M1 this low. At the time of writing this, only the gold model is in stock — both silver and space gray have sold out.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DnXCLq" id="f4ec40e804504237ab07f209c011ac06" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $850</a><p>This is far and away the best Apple laptop for most people thanks to its slender body, lack of fan noise and killer performance. We gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">score of 94</a> in part for those attributes, plus we also like its lovely Retina display, comfortable keyboard and trackpad and excellent 16-hour battery life.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The star of the show here is Apple&#39;s M1 chipset, which makes the Air run incredibly fast. The notebook wakes almost instantly when you open the lid, native apps run super smoothly and the machine as a whole is impressively responsive. You&#39;re also able to run iOS apps with the M1 chip, which is a fun feature to have. Graphics performance is noteworthy, too: MacBook Airs have not been gaming machines in the past, and we probably still wouldn&#39;t use it to run intense titles, but it performed well while playing Apple Arcade games and even <em>Fortnite</em>. And since the laptop doesn&#39;t have a fan inside, it&#39;ll be much quieter than most previous Apple laptops you may have had.</p><p>Our biggest complaints about the MacBook Air M1 are its paltry 720p webcam and its limit of two USB-C ports. While living the dongle life can get frustrating, it&#39;s a small price to pay for an otherwise stellar laptop that can handle most things you&#39;ll through at it.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-sale-150-off-amazon-131724416.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d17084bb-0130-4860-8445-f6ac1e48db57</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 13:17:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630070274</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T13:17:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Keychron's Q1 keyboard is its most customizable yet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The humble computer keyboard might feel utilitarian, but given it’s the part of your setup you interact with the most, it’s kinda wild that we don&#39;t often give it thought. Fortunately, there’s a vibrant scene of small (and not so small) companies that understand everyone’s needs are different and that getting the right size, shape and ergonomic layout can upgrade your working or gaming life in significant ways. Keychron is one such company.</p><p>Keychron has earned a reputation for making affordable yet feature-rich <a href="https://www.engadget.com/favorite-gadgets-2020-irl-170055096.html"><ins>mechanical keyboards</ins></a>, and <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1"><ins>the Q1</ins></a> (starting at $169) is the latest member of the family. The Q is a nod to <a href="https://qmk.fm/"><ins>QMK</ins></a>, a popular open-source firmware that lets you customize compatible keyboards to your liking. It’s Keychron’s most ambitious deck yet, and a direct competitor to something like the <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black"><ins>GMMK Pro</ins></a> or the <a href="https://kbdfans.com/collections/bella/products/bella?variant=34248579121291"><ins>KBDFans Bella</ins></a>, both of which cost north of $250 depending on your preferred configuration.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Q1 is a 75-percent keyboard, which means there’s no number pad and the home cluster and arrow keys are placed a little more tightly compared to a tenkeyless deck (that gives those keys a little more space of their own). The Q1 is Mac- and Windows compatible and comes with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Connector-USB-Mini-Mechanical-Keyboards/dp/B087PMN84K/ref=pd_sbs_1/133-9064674-5838700?pd_rd_w=8r8OV&amp;pf_rd_p=3676f086-9496-4fd7-8490-77cf7f43f846&amp;pf_rd_r=12SZFYEKC6CPH8H1W0K5&amp;pd_rd_r=5b785581-4f8c-4ec1-937d-fc4cf27136fd&amp;pd_rd_wg=JHWQ1&amp;pd_rd_i=B087PMN84K&amp;psc=1"><ins>Aviator style USB-C</ins></a> cable so that people know you really mean business. Alas, there’s no Bluetooth option here if that’s something you wanted.</p><p>As customization is the key here (no pun intended), it’s no surprise that the switches are hot-swappable. Keychron already offers a decent <a href="https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-keycap-collection-1"><ins>range of keycaps</ins></a>, though you can of course grab your own if you have a preferred set already. If you already own switches you like, you can order the barebone deck and save $20. You can also choose from three aluminum case colors: black, navy and space gray. Both ANSI and ISO layouts are available depending on your preference (or, more likely, location).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6c08f540-0666-11ec-b97e-9411ce8b9690" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="3a5db443-b6f8-3573-9633-afa91ede38c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>One thing I love about all Keychron keyboards is that they not only come with a keycap puller tool and a switch remover tool (where applicable), but you’ll also get the keycaps for both Windows and MacOS layouts. This makes it easy for the company just to stock one SKU and possibly helps keep costs down. If, like me, you use both operating systems — you can then repurpose any of their keyboards without having to buy new caps later. Or worse, live with a CMD key when you want a Windows key or vice versa.</p><p>A fancy keyboard isn’t anything without RGB lighting, of course, and naturally, that’s included here too. Keychron opted for a more subtle “south-facing” integration, which pretty much means what you think: The lights are only visible from below. I don’t need or use RGB, so I tend to turn it off. The implementation here is subtle yet bright enough to still remain useful if it’s something you want.</p><p>For the more hardcore enthusiast, inside there’s a gasket-based design with a noise-reducing foam deck between that and the PCB. For those who really like to get into details, know that the stabilizers here are screw-in (rather than plate), which usually means the larger keys are steadier. There’s also the option for a customized metal “badge” where the Insert key would be. If you send Keychron a design, it’ll etch it onto that badge for you to make it truly personalized. There will also be an option to add a rotary dial here (much like on the GMMK Pro), or you can just switch it back to the Insert key if none of that tickles your fancy.</p><p>For all its changeable parts, arguably the most useful way to customize the Q1 is with the <a href="https://caniusevia.com/"><ins>Via app</ins></a>, or with the aforementioned QMK. (Via is basically a graphical interface for the latter.) With Via you can reassign any key to pretty much anything else as well as design and assign macros to the function layer (i.e., press Fn and a target key to trigger more complex key combinations). More on this later.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cfd81b00-0666-11ec-b5f7-4c05c07fad59" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="28ee6b48-f727-36a1-8350-c3beac9f48ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>With all this talk about gaskets and stabilizers, it might seem that the Q1 is designed for advanced users. And it certainly will appeal to those with specific requirements. But Keychron’s popularity, in my opinion, is born out of making the geeky and exotic accessible to the normies out there. The Q1, then, is perhaps marketed toward those who have dabbled with mechanical keyboards and want to dip a toe into deeper waters, while still offering enough for the avid keyboard tinkerers.</p><p>That said, the first thing you’ll want to do with the Q1 when you take it out of the box is… put it down. At 3.5 pounds (1.6kg) it’s definitely on the chunky side. For context, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Bluetooth-Mechanical-Keyboard-Wireless-Keyboard/dp/B07QBPCGY2/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=keychron+k2&amp;qid=1629893215&amp;sr=8-3"><ins>Keychron’s K2</ins></a> wireless keyboard has a  similar footprint but is a svelte 1.5 pounds (663g) — less than half the weight. The Q1 isn’t really designed for portability, though, so that extra heft just glues it to your desk and makes you feel more confident that this isn’t going to rattle itself apart as you bash out fanfic/code/school essays on it. The weight is also pretty standard for this category.</p><p>The model I was able to test came pre-installed with Gateron brown switches. Before then I had been using Gateron reds but I’m an instant convert. Of course, the very point of the Q1 is that you can put in whatever switches you like. Keychron also included a set of blue switches, which I used to test out how easy it was to swap ‘em out. Not only was that process pretty easy (once you get used to the very firm pull required to get them out), but I found myself fond enough of the blues for certain keys that I left them in. They’re generally a little too loud for my taste to have across the board, but being able to mix things up that way is the very spirit of customizable keyboards like these.</p><p>On that theme of noise… for me that was one of the bigger turn-offs for mechanical keyboards. Until I experimented myself, my main exposure to them was hearing someone across the office frantically clacking their way through an email. This is why I gravitated toward red switches at first. On the Q1, though, even something clicky like a blue switch isn’t too audible thanks to the gasket design and the foam insert on the Q1. Even the noisier switch flavors won’t alert your neighbors to your frantic typing during the small hours. If, like my former officemate, you are unencumbered by such worries, know that the same design makes for a keyboard with comfortable flex, giving it a much smoother action than plate-based designs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/85c39120-0666-11ec-bfd7-6d15c7bb7329" style="height:1251;width:2000;" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="7d5d0010-f16e-3e96-8c62-3e03ec6b6dca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As alluded to earlier, though, perhaps one of the more exciting features here for those looking to take their keyboard customization to the next level is the support for VIA/QMK firmware noodling. If you get tired of doing the same convoluted keyboard shortcuts for regular tasks (like Windows’ Ctrl+Win+Arrow combo to switch between desktops), this is for you.</p><p>I already mentioned you can pretty much map any key to another. So if you wanted to swap Z and X around… you could. More usefully, you can also change which keys control media etcetera. Out of the box, the Q1 uses the standard “Fn+F10” combo to mute audio. My stubby fingers found this a little unnatural, so I used Via to remap it to Fn+Left Arrow. Much more manageable for my typing style.</p><p>Taking things a bit further, you can also enter much more complicated key combinations with macros. An explanation of this is beyond the scope of this article, but as an example, I was able to set up a simple key combo to launch one of my favorite chat apps. This was more of an experiment for someone who hasn’t done anything remotely like programming in a number of years. You’ll need to do some reading up to figure out how to tell a macro what to do, but once you have (and it’s really not that hard), you’ll find yourself thinking of evermore clever ideas.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fec336c0-0666-11ec-8efa-fa48fb8d4993" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="9ebde6c5-c863-37d7-98b9-1508def46dba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Some keyboards, like the GMMK Pro, offer their own software for customization. You can generally expect these apps to be a little more tightly integrated with the makers’ products, but VIA is easy enough to use that you can get most things done without much hassle.</p><p>Support for VIA/QMK is far from unique to the Q1: The GMMK Pro and KDBFans Bella both offer it too, along with many other customizable keyboards. But considering the price of the Q1, it rounds out an impressive spec sheet making it both a very accessible yet technically capable choice.</p><p>Some potential buyers might lament the lack of wireless connectivity, or the fact you can’t adjust its height (it measures just shy of two inches/45mm at the back). But both of these things are fairly standard for barebones and customizable keyboards. The fact that you can configure pretty much anything else to your liking makes this a great entry into the world of barebones keyboards at a price that’s very competitive.</p><p>The Q1 is available now directly from Keychron starting at $1.69. The rotary dial add-on will come in the following weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/keychron-q-1-fully-customizable-keyboard-130015959.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b0f96be6-d9a9-4bee-a9f7-c4fcb0d234c2</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 13:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630058088</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T09:55:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/196541e0-0666-11ec-be5e-e314ca333cd9" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/196541e0-0666-11ec-be5e-e314ca333cd9" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer's Blade 15 Advanced is $900 off in Amazon's one-day sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is ushering in the weekend with a one-day-only sale on a bunch of Razer laptops and gaming accessories.

The tech giant has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-microsoft-warns-thousands-cloud-customers-exposed-databases-emails-2021-08-26/">warned</a> its clients of the flaw in its flagship database service Cosmos DB after it was discovered and reported by security company Wiz. In the <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/chaosdb-how-we-hacked-thousands-of-azure-customers-databases">blog post</a> Wiz has published, it said it was able to use the vulnerability, which it has named &quot;ChaosDB,&quot; to gain &quot;complete unrestricted access to the accounts and databases&quot; of thousands of Azure clients.</p><p>Azure customers, including Fortune 500 companies such as Coca-Cola and Exxon-Mobil, use Cosmos DB to manage the massive amounts of data they get in real time. The company explained that it found a series of flaws in the Cosmos DB feature called Jupyter Notebook that gives customers a way to visualize their data. That feature has been around since 2019, but it was switched on for all Cosmos DB customers just this past February. Wiz said that a series of misconfigurations in the notebook created a loophole, which allows any user &quot;to download, delete or manipulate a massive collection of commercial databases, as well as read/write access to the underlying architecture of Cosmos DB.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the security company praised Microsoft for disabling the notebook within 48 hours after it was alerted about the issue and for notifying around 30 percent of its customers, it warned that more clients may be at risk. Microsoft only notified the customers that were affected during Wiz&#39;s week-long research period this early August. However, the security firm believes the vulnerability has been exploitable for months, possibly even years. It&#39;s now advising Azure customers to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/secure-access-to-data?tabs=using-primary-key#primary-keys">rotate and regenerate</a> their access keys even if they didn&#39;t get an email from Microsoft. That said, the tech giant said it found no evidence that the flaw has been exploited. It told the customers it emailed that there&#39;s no &quot;indication that external entities outside the researcher (Wiz) had access to the primary read-write key</p><p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-microsoft-warns-thousands-cloud-customers-exposed-databases-emails-2021-08-26/"><em>Reuters</em></a> notes, this is the latest in a series of bad security news for Microsoft over the past year. In February, the tech giant has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solarwinds-hackers-microsoft-source-code-3-products-063418253.html">revealed</a> that the SolarWinds hackers accessed and downloaded source code for Azure, its cloud-based management solution Intune and its mail and calendar server Exchange. The Chinese Hafnium hacking group also exploited a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-releases-a-one-click-patch-for-its-critical-exchange-vulnerability-090242055.html">vulnerability in Exchange</a> to infiltrate at least 30,000 organizations around the world, including police departments, hospitals and banks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-azure-flaw-cloud-customers-data-vulnerable-114027306.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d8286e34-3cb5-4ee0-8920-afa959f2faa9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 11:40:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630062122</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T11:02:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/46b840c0-a798-11eb-bfad-ddeeded166e8" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/46b840c0-a798-11eb-bfad-ddeeded166e8" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HJBC via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ISSY LES MOULINEAUX, FRANCE - OCTOBER 9, 2020: French headquarters of Microsoft, American multinational company which develops, manufactures, licenses and sells computer software and electronics]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[French headquarters of Microsoft, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Explaining Apple’s $100 million App Store settlement]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following the class-action lawsuit between Apple and app developers, the company has agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-change-app-store-rules-class-action-lawsuit-010727976.html">change several App Store rules</a>, including allowing developers to email users “about payment methods outside of their iOS app” — think Netflix and Spotify offering subscription setups through the internet browser, all without Apple taking a cut.

Waymo confirmed the decision to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/alphabets-waymo-stop-selling-lidar-self-driving-car-sensors-sources-2021-08-27/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, adding that it&#39;s now focusing on deploying its Waymo Driver tech across its Waymo One ride-hailing and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-23-waymo-autonomous-truck-tests-texas-new-mexico.html">Waymo Via</a> trucking divisions.</p><p>The decision comes in the wake of long-term <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-steps-down-190610549.html">CEO John Krafcik&#39;s departure</a>, who was replaced at the helm by Waymo execs Tekedra Mawakana and Dmitri Dolgov. Some <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/02/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-steps-aside-as-co-ceos-take-over.html">suggested</a> that Krafcik&#39;s deliberate approach was hindering the company&#39;s push toward commercialization. Earlier this month, Waymo hit a milestone of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-autonomous-vehicles-update-san-francisco-193934150.html">20 billion miles</a> driven in simulations, with 20 million on public roads.

It initially planned to sell its short-range sensor (known as Laser Bear Honeycomb) to businesses in the robotics, security and agricultural technology sectors.

While its simulated and real world driving tests have helped it to amass a massive dataset that is crunched using machine learning-based software. According to anonymous sources cited by <em>Reuters</em>, Waymo intends to use in-house tech and external suppliers for its next-gen LiDARs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-car-lidar-103642444.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1685301b-ffb9-4f61-b8e6-ccbfd0c7c999</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 10:36:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630068101</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T12:41:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ff655400-0733-11ec-b6fc-947e970011e3" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ff655400-0733-11ec-b6fc-947e970011e3" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Frandino / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A white Waymo self-driving SUV is parked in the street.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[WAYMO-SANFRANCISCO/]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Streamlabs' new monthly tipping service doesn't take a cut from streamers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Streamlabs&#39; new livestreaming tool offers streamers a new way to make money — and it won&#39;t even be taking a commission. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-logitech-streamlabs.html">Logitech-owned</a> company has launched a monthly tipping service called <a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-unveils-new-way-for-viewers-to-subscribe-to-live-streamers">Streamlabs Creator Subscription</a>, which (as you can probably guess from its name) gives streamers a way to set up a subscription service for viewers. Streamlabs says creators will get 100 percent of the tips fans give them after PayPal takes its usual processing fees.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643160/streamlabs-monthly-tipping-subscription-twitch-zero-fees"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, that makes Streamlabs Creator Subscription a more appealing option than Twitch&#39;s built-in service, which takes a 50 percent cut from the subscription fees streamers get. Especially since Streamlabs&#39; new tipping tool can be directly integrated into its popular OBS software suite anyway. The OBS software can be used to stream not just on Twitch, but also on YouTube, Facebook and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-streamlabs-live-streaming-integration-165006138.html">TikTok</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Streamlabs will let creators decide on what kind of subscription service they want to offer their fans, and they can also set specific price points. If they choose, however, they can allow viewers to choose how much to contribute every month. Fans will get &quot;redeemable alerts&quot; in exchange for their contributions, and they can use those if they want their favorite streamer to thank them on screen. Streamlabs will also be adding leaderboards and badges in the coming weeks to encourage fans to support their favorite creators.</p><p>Ashray Urs, Head of Product at Streamlabs, said in a statement:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;As the live streaming industry has grown, so has the need for a sustainable revenue model. Currently, most major streaming platforms provide viewers with a way to subscribe to a channel; however, they usually split the revenue from the subscription in half between the creators and platform. In addition, platforms require a creator to meet certain qualifications before they can unlock the ability for viewers to subscribe. Streamlabs Creator Subscription is open for anyone with a Streamlabs tip page, regardless of size or how often they stream.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-creator-subscription-095053962.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49cddcfc-c663-4967-97ee-b4bdedf305b0</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 09:50:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630055685</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T09:14:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cdfb0740-070e-11ec-b5e2-71b80c067d2c" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cdfb0740-070e-11ec-b5e2-71b80c067d2c" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[fpphotobank via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cute young asian girl enthusiastically plays on her smartphone in a computer club, while her friends play online games with each other.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cute young asian girl enthusiastically plays on her smartphone in a computer club, while her friends play online games with each other]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Puma is releasing official 'Animal Crossing' sneakers and clothing]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo&#39;s colorful, character-filled island life sim <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>lends itself to merchandise collabs.

Now Apple says developers are in fact allowed to make such “communications” via email or other methods as long as they don&#39;t do so directly in their app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“To give developers even more flexibility to reach their customers, Apple is also clarifying that developers can use communications, such as email, to share information about payment methods outside of their iOS app,” Apple writes in its statement.</p><p>The company is also promising more transparency around its app review process, which developers have said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-developers-171550382.html"><ins>is confusing</ins></a> and difficult to navigate. Apple says it will release an “annual transparency report” that will “share meaningful statistics about the app review process, including the number of apps rejected for different reasons, the number of customer and developer accounts deactivated, objective data regarding search queries and results, and the number of apps removed from the App Store.”</p><p>There are other changes that are meant to give developers more flexibility in setting their prices. Apple says it will increase the number of price points available to app makers from “fewer than 100 to more than 500.” Those changes are expected by the end of next year, according to <a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/press/apple-ios-app-developers/us-ios-developers-to-benefit-from-100-million-apple-small-developer-assistance-fund-and-changes-to-app-store-policies-in-developer-antitrust-class-action-settlement">a statement</a> from attorneys representing the developers. Additionally, Apple agreed as part of the settlement to keep in place the changes it originally said were in response to COVID-19 that reduced commissions to 15 percent for developers making less than $1 million a year. That change will now be in effect for “at least the next three years.”</p><p>The changes are in response to a class action lawsuit that dates back to 2019. Developers making less than $1 million may also be able to receive payments as part of the settlement, though <a href="http://www.smallappdeveloperassistance.com/"><ins>the website</ins></a> with details on the arrangements hasn’t yet been published.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-change-app-store-rules-class-action-lawsuit-010727976.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">11597e9d-a170-45c5-8431-6c2f621e1e10</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 01:07:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630027985</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T01:33:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/d70cfaa0-e7cf-11ea-aeff-64fdfeebef06" width="5079" height="3386" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/d70cfaa0-e7cf-11ea-aeff-64fdfeebef06" width="5079" height="3386" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Lam / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A group of young developers stand for a group photo on stage during the Apple World Wide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California, U.S., June 13, 2016.

The hacker claiming to be responsible for the attack, John Binns, told the <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105?mod=latest_headlines">discussion</a> that T-Mobile&#39;s security was &quot;awful.&quot; Binns reportedly broke through by using a readily available tool to find an exposed router, and took a week to delve through customer data stored in a data center near East Wenatchee, Washington.</p><p>Binns, who provided apparent evidence to back up his claims of involvement, said he breached T-Mobile and stole the data to create &quot;noise&quot; that drew attention to him. He came forward to highlight his claims he had been kidnapped in Germany and placed into a fake mental hospital. There wasn&#39;t any evidence to support that allegation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>T-Mobile declined to comment on Binns&#39; claims in response to the <em>Journal</em>. It previously stated that it was &quot;confident&quot; it had closed the security holes used in the breach, which compromised sensitive info for more than 54 million active and former customers.</p><p>The incident is the third breach in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-data-breach-security-phone-number-hack-2020-172117333.html">two years</a>, and suggests that T-Mobile is still struggling to offer security that matches its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-t-mobile-completes-sprint-merger.html">rapidly growing</a> customer base. It only hired a new security leader earlier in 2021, for instance. If Binns&#39; claims are accurate, though, the ease of the attack is also frightening — it only took a casual hack to put tens of millions of people at risk of fraud and other data crimes. The company may need to scramble if it&#39;s going to reassure customers that breaches will be rare going forward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-hacker-says-carrier-security-weak-212819523.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b727ad46-4698-433d-9f52-c15dd7c309b6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:28:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630013302</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T21:28:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/00a273e0-01ce-11ec-93bb-3f4f8012b9e4" width="5324" height="3549" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/00a273e0-01ce-11ec-93bb-3f4f8012b9e4" width="5324" height="3549" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ARLINGTON, VA - AUGUST 18:  People walk past the front of a T-Mobile retail store on August 18, 2021 in Arlington, Virginia.

What it won’t do is ban communities that “challenge the consensus views on the pandemic.”</p><p>“Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy.

This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Huffman’s statement doesn’t reference a specific community or incident, but as <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgx3gw/reddit-responds-to-calls-from-moderators-to-fight-disinformation"><em>Vice</em> points out</a>, what likely prompted him to say anything at all was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vaxxhappened/comments/pbe8nj/we_call_upon_reddit_to_take_action_against_the/">thread from r/vaxxhappened</a>, a subreddit where people share memes about anti-vaxxers. “We call upon Reddit to take action against the rampant Coronavirus misinformation on their website,” says the title of the post, which accuses Reddit of doing &quot;nothing of substance&quot; to tackle the problem of misinformation on the platform. As of the writing of this article, it has nearly 170,000 upvotes, with various other communities crossposting the thread to their subreddits.</p><p>“We could have been better off months ago, but disinformation and lies have been allowed to spread readily through inaction and malice, and have dragged this on at the cost of lives,” the post says. “There can be no room for leniency when people are dying as a result of misinformation on this platform. Reddit as a global platform needs to take responsibility here.”</p><p>While Reddit often isn’t mentioned in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">same breath as Facebook and Twitter</a>, the platform is a source of misinformation.

The developer wants a name that &quot;better represents&quot; <em>Overwatch</em> ideals, according to a statement.</p><p>The company had planned a story arc for September that would have featured McCree, but is delaying that narrative until later in 2021 to reflect the name change. Players will instead get a new free-for-all map that month.
