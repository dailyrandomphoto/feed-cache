To achieve that, it will hire more than 3,000 full-time associate delivery drivers and build out a fleet of all-electric delivery vans.&nbsp;</p><p>The InHome service, which handles more than 160,000 items from 3,400 stores, first launched in 2019. Since then, it&#39;s been operating in select markets at a fee of $19.95 per month or $148 per year, a bit more than the $119 you pay for Amazon Prime membership. However, Walmart notes that tips for associates are built into the fee.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once signed up, you can order items from the Walmart app and select InHome as the preferred delivery method. Drivers can unlock the customer&#39;s door using a one-time access code, with a vest-worn camera recording the entire delivery. You can use your own smart lock or purchase one from InHome for $50.&nbsp;</p><p>Walmart said that the new associate delivery driver position is full-time and includes benefits like medical, vision and dental insurance, 401K matching, paid time off and free college degrees. Drivers also get paid a $1.50/hour premium compared to other store workers.&nbsp;</p><p>The company plans to equip those workers with a fleet of all-electric vans. It has yet to specify exactly which delivery vehicles it will use, though it has tested EV&#39;s used by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/walmart-invests-gm-autonomous-car-startup-cruise-101019112.html">GM&#39;s Cruise division</a> and autonomous, electric box trucks employed by a startup called <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/08/walmart-is-using-fully-driverless-trucks-to-ramp-up-its-online-grocery-business.html">Gatik</a>. Walmart said it will make InHome delivery service accessible to 30 million households by the end of the year, reaching around 70 percent of the US population.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/walmart-expanding-inhome-delivery-30-million-households-132840121.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8168fd6f-c61f-4ff2-9e54-55cbdfb3a376</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:28:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641389325</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T13:28:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/49c80d30-6e27-11ec-9bfa-c56c8faa93c6" width="920" height="600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/49c80d30-6e27-11ec-9bfa-c56c8faa93c6" width="920" height="600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Walmart]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Walmart expanding its InHome Delivery to 30 million households in 2022]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Walmart expanding its InHome Delivery to 30 million households in 2022]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[512 Audio debuts its first 'studio-inspried' USB mics for creators]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another year of restrictions means the excuses for not starting that podcast are surely drying up. If your last one was “I can’t find a USB mic I like,” then 512 Audio might be about to ruin your (procrastinator’s) day. The company is unveiling two USB microphones at CES this year along with a podcast-friendly audio interface.</p><p>If you do (or plan on doing) a lot of vocal work, the $119 <a href="https://512audio.com/product/script"><ins>Script</ins></a> microphone might be the one to consider. The vintage styling is based on Warm Audio’s WA-14 studio condenser microphone (512 Audio is a subsidiary of Warm). The Script is dual-pattern (Cardioid/Omni) and the dual 14mm capsules are tuned to vocal work, so the company claims. Thanks to its USB connection, the Script offers zero-latency monitoring via a headphone jack and onboard gain/mute controls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Should you want a microphone that’s a little more versatile, then the $160 <a href="https://512audio.com/product/tempest"><ins>Tempest</ins></a> might be a better fit. Like the Script, there are onboard monitoring and volume controls. The Tempest also offers a larger, 34mm capsule, for those that want a more responsive sound. This model, too, is based on one of Warm’s existing microphones – specifically the <a href="https://warmaudio.com/wa47jr/"><ins>WA 47Jr</ins></a>. Though we don’t know if these microphones are just USB versions of the ones they mimic or are simply visually inspired by them (at the very least, the WA14 offers more polar patterns than its 512 counterpart).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b55480c0-6e17-11ec-974b-01e8ef54786c" style="height:1216;width:1949;" alt="512 Audio announces a new podcast-friendly audio interface." data-uuid="589eb87a-d979-31ab-96fa-008b12666210"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">512 Audio</div></figure><p>With both of the new microphones offering USB connectivity, you won’t need an interface to connect them to your PC, but 512 Audio is unveiling <a href="https://512audio.com/product/audio-interface"><ins>one of their own</ins></a> for those that already have XLR microphones and want to plug them into something a little more podcast friendly than a generic interface.</p><p>While there’s no pricing information at this time, the audio interface has two combo ports for the aforementioned XLR mics and or ¼-inch instruments. There’s also a 3.5mm input for phones and other compatible devices. Perfect for introducing a “caller” onto your show or simply for feeding in other audio sources as you see fit. There are two headphone outputs on the front, which is a definite perk for podcasters and even a mute button for the mics which is less common than you might think, and handy in a podcast scenario for talking off-air or avoiding coughs and other unwanted sounds.</p><p>Of all the above, the Tempest will be launching first, slated for March this year. The Script will be available in “spring” and the audio interface will come later this year.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/512-audio-script-tempest-usb-microphones-130018337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9253a5ac-2738-4de3-8e1a-5bde0645b33d</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641381461</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T13:17:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Microphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/94b46930-6e16-11ec-baee-15b80360569e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/94b46930-6e16-11ec-baee-15b80360569e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[512 Audio]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[512 Audio Script / Tempest USB microphones.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[512 Audio Script / Tempest USB microphones]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Sony reveals PlayStation VR2 specs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Of course, the year when many media outlets and companies decide to skip on attending CES in person, Sony decides this is the year to make some news at its press conference. While we got more news on its EV plans, and next-gen TVs, Tom Holland was also drafted into the showcase to promote the forthcoming Uncharted feature film.</p><p>Then it hit us with a barrage of specs for the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-reveals-playstation-vr-2-sense-controllers-023113499.html">next-gen PlayStation VR headset</a>. It will, of course, be compatible with the PS5 and the VR2 Sense controllers we’ve already seen. It will have a display resolution of 2,000 x 2,040 pixel per eye, a 110-degree field of view, and be capable of 90 to 120Hz frame rates, all while supporting 4K HDR.</p><p>The world of consumer VR has rocketed forward since the original PSVR, so Sony is playing catchup with features like inside-out tracking, which uses multiple embedded cameras to track the movements of your head and controllers. There will also be “headset feedback” which sounds like the headset will shake and vibrate like a DualShock/DualSense controller. We’re still waiting to see what it’ll look like, how much it’ll cost and when we’ll get to buy one, but the company did announce one of the first games arriving on the platform: <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>, which will be a VR experience set in the Horizon universe.</p><p>-Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-freestyle-portable-projector-auto-leveling-focus-023047886.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Samsung&#39;s portable Freestyle projector focuses and levels automatically</a></h2><h3>The floodlight-style device weighs just 1.83 lbs.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-freestyle-portable-projector-auto-leveling-focus-023047886.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/60f8c050-6e1b-11ec-9ddf-a73a1eb7a8b5" style="height:450;width:675;" alt="TMA" data-uuid="cb056b74-3b53-3ac2-a9ee-db5f21030d11"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure></a><p>Samsung&#39;s new portable projector uses autofocus and auto-leveling features that&#39;ll help align whatever you&#39;re watching, meaning you&#39;ll have a lot of options for where to place it.</p><p>You&#39;ll be able to project content at a display size ranging from 30 to 100 inches with a 1080p resolution.

The chipmaker has announced that it&#39;s bringing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-cpu-laptops-alder-lake-181007259.html">hybrid 12th-gen CPUs to laptops</a> a few months after they were introduced for desktop computers. These CPUs combine performance cores (P-cores) and efficient cores (E-cores) on a single chip to be able to better handle the demands of various real-world tasks. Their faster cores can power your game, for instance, while the slower cores are taking care of your livestreaming needs. They&#39;ll top out at 14 cores for laptops, which include HP&#39;s updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-elitebook-zbook-january-2022-update-181010578.html">EliteBook and ZBooks</a>, as well as MSI&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/msi-stealth-gs77-ces-2022-annoucement-210010607.html">Stealth GS77 and Stealth GS66</a> gaming laptops. Intel has also revealed that its 12th-gen KS-series chips for desktop, which are arriving this spring, will be able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intels-12th-gen-ks-series-cpu-5-5ghz-181625713.html">reach 5.5GHz</a> on a single core. Plus, it&#39;s adding a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-evo-3rd-edition-foldable-pc-iphone-181039141.html">foldable specification</a> for its premium Evo PC line this year.

The new prototype is an SUV that the company is calling <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202201/22-002E/">Vision-S 02</a>. Sony took the sedan&#39;s EV and cloud platforms and put them in a new form factor to create the vehicle, which features a large interior that can seat seven.&nbsp;</p><p>The electric SUV has sensors all over its body, including CMOS image and LiDAR sensors for its driver assistance system. Sony says it&#39;s conducting tests in Europe as part of its efforts to release a Level 2+ driver assistance technology on public roads. Inside, there are Time-of-Flight sensors for driver authentication, as well as support for intuitive gesture and voice commands. The vehicle will also have 5G connectivity to enable over-the-air updates and remote operation, which Sony is currently working on with its partners.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the Vision-S 02 is just a prototype at the moment, Sony has ambitions to become a player in the electric vehicle industry and sell its cars to the public. It will establish an operating company named &quot;Sony Mobility Inc.&quot; this spring and will explore entry into the EV market. The company didn&#39;t reveal what other steps it&#39;s taking to achieve that goal, and it remains to be seen whether it&#39;ll truly be able to release its Vision-S vehicles. It&#39;s worth noting, however, that Sony has been testing its electric sedan on public roads in Europe since December 2020 and has also started verification tests of the safety and user experience of the vehicle&#39;s imaging and sensing technology.</p><div id="abf27df284b0449d93251bb749937dd2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Innovation of mobility.<br><br>Sony&#39;s Vision-S <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2022?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2022</a><a href="https://t.co/lLykDAUapB">pic.twitter.com/lLykDAUapB</a></p>— Sony (@Sony) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sony/status/1478541341764333569?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-vision-s-02-electric-suv-mobility-inc-071335668.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60de2d9b-559e-4638-a8c4-a03344007281</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 07:13:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641388724</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T13:18:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/638185b0-6e29-11ec-beb5-d38079b9131a" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/638185b0-6e29-11ec-beb5-d38079b9131a" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony Vision-S 02 concept SUV next to the original Vision-S.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony Vision-S 02]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chrysler's first concept EV could offer up to 400 miles of range]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Electrified pickups and SUVs may be all the rage but there&#39;s apparently still plenty of room in the EV market for more battery-powered autos and crossovers.

As usual, the small black buds take the same completely in canal (CIC) form factor which is what allows them to remain almost entirely out of sight. The &quot;new&quot; stuff is on the inside.</p><p>The flagship feature with the Eargo 6 is called &quot;Sound Adjust.&quot; No prizes for guessing what this does, but the company claims its proprietary algorithm can automatically sense your surroundings and the hearing aids will automatically optimize themselves to give you the best settings for it. Profiles are a fairly standard feature on most hearing aids, but automatic switching is usually something reserved for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/head-to-head-with-two-of-the-most-techenabled-hearing-aids-133039853.html">pricier models</a>, and they all do it with different levels of success, in my experience at least.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The difference here is that the Eargo 6 is much smaller than most of the other products that offer similar technologies. Being tiny is great, and the main selling point here, but it also means there&#39;s much less real estate to fill with sensors and chips. Regardless, Eargo seems to be figuring out clever ways to bring their offerings up to feature parity with their (physically and metaphorically) larger competition.</p><p>Of course, it wouldn&#39;t be CES 2022 without a few COVID-related influences. For the last two years, those with hearing loss have faced a new challenge: Conversing with people who are wearing a mask. Not only does this remove any visual feedback, it also muffles sound — a double blow for those struggling to understand you. As such, the company has introduced a &quot;mask mode&quot; that aims to resolve some of the changes in sound that face coverings create.</p><p>Other tweaks this time around include revised noise reduction with the company claims further reduces background noise allowing the voice to punch through. The Eargo 6 is also rated IPX7 for water resistance. This means they can be submerged for 30 minutes at a depth of one meter without water damage. In practical terms, this means you can probably leave them in while you shower or go for a quick swim. Or, more logically, you can get them a bit when while cleaning them.</p><p>As we&#39;re not physically at CES this year, we haven&#39;t been able to test them like we normally do, but if previous years are anything to go by the plucky little hearing aid is only getting smarter and more useful. As usual, the Eargo 6 is being sold direct to consumers and will retail for $2,950. In hearing aid terms that&#39;s about the going rate for higher-end models, though the company does offer financing options too.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eargo-6-hearing-aid-030036492.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">df3f6e1b-c6da-4b05-8a4c-ded3cc4d8a6d</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 03:00:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641389017</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T13:23:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9d090aa0-6e2a-11ec-bbf9-833445ffdce1" width="5517" height="3706" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9d090aa0-6e2a-11ec-bbf9-833445ffdce1" width="5517" height="3706" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eargo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Eargo 6 hearing aides and charging case.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Eargo 6]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shokz OpenRun Pro bone-conduction headphones bump up the bass]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve been an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-aftershokz-aeropex-open-ear-headphones-bone-conduction.html">avid user</a> of bone-conduction headphones for years and can attest to the lackluster low-end in this form factor. Luckily, things are improving. Along with recently changing its name to Shokz (formerly Aftershokz), the company has delivered on this long-desired feature upgrade to its line of bone-conduction headphones. The new product is called <a href="https://shokz.com/products/openrunpro">OpenRun Pro</a> ($179.95) and there is a significant boost in bass with this Bluetooth 5.1 headset. In addition, Shokz is renaming its existing product line to tie things together with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-aftershokz-aeropex-open-ear-headphones-bone-conduction.html">Aeropex</a> becoming OpenRun and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-aftershokz-xtrainerz-optishokz-revvez-bone-conduction-sunglasses.html">Xtrainerz</a> now called OpenSwim.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="1cf4e2dd-7362-4a61-a99b-5930e66a9645"/><p>For those new to bone-conduction headphones, let me clarify a few things. These still don’t <em>quite</em> measure up to over-ear or in-ear models, since they have an open-ear design. The transducers rest against your cheeks in <em>front</em> of your ears and deliver sound to your inner ear via the bone. It’s a different delivery system for sound that leaves your ears open to the world, which can be a double-edged sword. They’re not great on the subway or in generally noisy environments. Don’t be disheartened, though, as this same design lets you walk, run or bike around and listen to music while still being able to hear the world around you. And with the upgrades we&#39;re seeing, the audio experience is better than ever.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Until now, diminished low-end has long been a problem for this form factor. The OpenRun (Aeropex) have good volume levels and a decent frequency response compared to previous models. But now that I’ve tested the OpenRun pro, there’s been a noticeable improvement in the low-end spectrum. I don’t mean that they’re so loud they’re literally bouncing off your cheeks (like the old <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-18-aftershokz-trekz-titanium.html">Titanium model</a> did). These deliver a good sub-frequency to give your tunes more depth without excessive tactile reverberation. My standard listening is techno and electronic music (<a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/jon-turi/jonturi-2021-series-02/">like this</a>) and it holds up pretty well. The decibel and frequency response specs are the same as before, but acoustic tweaks have born fruit. For bone conduction headphones, the OpenRun Pro sounds great.</p><p>Other desirable enhancements in this new model include the fit and charging capability. The over-the-ear curve is more rounded and the side enclosures are 20-percent smaller than before. This makes them feel light and comfortable. The battery life has been bumped up from 8 to 10 hours of listening and you can charge fully in one hour (a whole hour less than before). On top of that, we’re told you can get 1.5 hours worth of listening in five minutes of charging. A great feature when you’re settling in for a workout and hear the headset exclaim “charge me”.</p><p>If you’ve just gotten Aeropex headphones over the holidays, don’t fret. I’ve been using these for a long while and have enjoyed the experience. I even feel that while there’s not as much bass, these could be a <em>touch</em> louder in the mid to high range than the new model.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, the OpenRun Pro has traded complete waterproofing for better sound. A fine mesh grate covers two vents in front of and below the cheek-based delivery system, changing it to IP55 water-resistant (still more than adequate). The OpenRun (Aeropex) retains its IP67 rating due to its sealed enclosure. If you want to wear these in the shower, then you’re in a good place (but maybe consider OpenSwim if this is a habit).</p><p>As of today, the <a href="https://shokz.com/">entire line</a> is available for purchase including the new <a href="https://shokz.com/">OpenRun Pro</a> ($179.95) with a few new colors (although only available in black at launch). The fully-waterproof <a href="https://shokz.com/products/openswim">OpenSwim</a> is still $149.95, while the <a href="https://shokz.com/products/openrun">OpenRun</a> ($129.95) will continue to be available at its recently lowered price.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e5b2c390-6cae-11ec-beff-9f0bfc47d140" alt="Shokz OpenRun Pro color options" data-uuid="de95a169-5cc7-3c70-9ad9-1a08725a8207"><figcaption>The new OpenRun Pro color options.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Shokz</div></figure><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/aftershokz-shokz-openrun-pro-bone-conduction-headphones-bass-030031419.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e5bd8ecf-5ddf-4a63-a244-1494aafa9179</guid><dc:creator>Jon Turi</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 03:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641355157</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T11:39:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Turi]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/88b41cd0-6cad-11ec-b78d-557e548be86b" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6278590-6cad-11ec-8f9b-1b95156bda89" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shokz OpenRun Pro bone conduction headphones in grey shown close-up on a wooden table top.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Shokz OpenRun Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wemo's Smart Video Doorbell is exclusive to the Apple ecosystem]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s no shortage of app-connected, camera-enabled doorbells on the market, and now there&#39;s one more, this time from IoT company Wemo, a subsidiary of Belkin International.

The new headset will be compatible with the PS5 and with the new VR2 Sense controllers. It has a display resolution of 2000 x 2040 pixel per eye, has a 110-degree field of view, is capable of 90 to 120Hz frame rates and supports 4K HDR.</p><p>The PS VR2 features inside-out tracking, which means it has multiple embedded cameras to track the movements of your head and controllers. Sony has also introduced a new sensory feature for the device called &quot;headset feedback&quot; that can make games and experiences even more immersive. Headset feedback uses a built-in motor with vibrations to simulate in-game events — it can, for instance, mimic the feel of a character&#39;s elevated pulse rate while they&#39;re hiding from a threat or the feel of objects passing close to a character&#39;s head.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>3D audio and eye tracking are a couple of other features that create immersion. The headset can detect the motion of your eyes, allowing you to interact with the game environment like you&#39;d interact with the real world. As for the PS VR2 Sense controllers, they&#39;ll have key features from the DualSense controllers, particularly haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. While Sony has yet to reveal the headset&#39;s availability, the company announced one of the first games arriving on the platform. <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain, </em>a VR experience in the Horizon universe, is apparently being built for the PS VR2 and will be an exclusive title for the platform.</p><div id="ecb98f40768347fb96332f0a082201fe"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yPNn-jwAC9c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-reveals-playstation-vr-2-sense-controllers-023113499.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4b5c898-f664-4387-8787-f19506432534</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 02:31:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641349876</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T11:39:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e139fa10-6dc9-11ec-b6b7-c451aaf1e6f8" width="1632" height="918" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e139fa10-6dc9-11ec-b6b7-c451aaf1e6f8" width="1632" height="918" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's portable Freestyle projector focuses and levels automatically]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/samsung/">Samsung&#39;s</a> making more moves in the portable projector market with its new Freestyle model.

The earcups on the 40 rotate flat and fold inward for easy storage, making them a decent option for travel.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/22a86d20-6d74-11ec-bfdf-7b4acf66d34b" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="Shure Aonic 40" data-uuid="b3515ce7-524b-3b25-8a90-7f70b19d553d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Shure</div></figure><p>Shure says you can expect its &quot;iconic sound&quot; alongside a fully customizable EQ via its ShurePlus Play app on Android and iOS. That software will allow you to save any created settings for future access. The app also allows you to choose between three ANC options as well as tweak the Environment Mode (ambient sound). Shure also says the software is equipped with a hi-res music player that works with the Aonic 40.&nbsp;</p><p>As is typically the case with headphones these days, Shure is hyping call quality thanks to dual beamforming microphones. On-board controls will allow you to easily answer those, in addition to volume adjustments and accessing both the ANC and ambient sound options. The company says you&#39;ll get up to 25 hours of battery life with active noise cancellation turned on — up from 20 hours on the Aonic 50. Plus, a quick charge option can offer five hours of use in 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The Aonic 40 is available now in black and white color options for $249.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/shure-aonic-40-headphones-announced-price-specs-availability-020042770.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">876638b2-4814-4389-bf6b-f05331a0c03c</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 02:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641311020</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T11:40:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5f76b570-6d71-11ec-a938-f412d5d2987d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5f76b570-6d71-11ec-a938-f412d5d2987d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shure]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shure Aonic 40]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Shure Aonic 40]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The OnePlus 10 Pro is the first new phone of 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First out of the gates in 2022, OnePlus has a new flagship for anyone <em>already</em> looking for a smartphone refresh.

They include a 120Hz Fluid AMOLED with LTPO screen, which means the phone can adjust its refresh rates to improve battery life. There are no specifics on screen size, but the rumors suggest it’ll be a pretty large 6.7-inch display. OnePlus will include 80W fast charging and 50W wireless charging in its new flagship, which should be suitably speedy when the 5,000mAh battery needs charging.<br><br>The OnePlus 10 Pro will be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip, running Android 12 with OnePlus’ OxygenOS tricks and aesthetics. When it comes to cameras, expect 48- and 50-megapixel sensors with an additional 8MP sensor too. Optical zoom? Ultrawide? We don’t know just yet, but the camera array will include dual optical image stabilization, which should help with crisper images, less noise and better performance in low light. That said, the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera performance was one of the weaker points on an otherwise impressive smartphone. <br><br>Hopefully, the 10 Pro can right that wrong.The big challenge could be balancing price, specs and features so that it offers enough go up against the high-end phones of Apple and Samsung.

Building on more than 50 years of design development with the automaker&#39;s prestigious M line, the iX M60 (along with the upcoming i4 M50) mark BMW&#39;s first forays into high-performance electric vehicles.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3ddb0990-6da1-11ec-bd7f-19f63b7428f4" alt="iX M60 rear" data-uuid="68c66981-cf5b-3ee4-b44c-8dba52b601c0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>In addition to sporting 610 horsepower, the all-wheel drive iX M60 will offer 811 ft-lbs of torque, which translates into a 3.6 second 0-60 (not bad for a vehicle weighing 6,900 pounds), a top speed of 155 mph, and an estimated 280 mile range using the standard 21-inch wheels. It&#39;s dual <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/electric-motor/Synchronous-motors">synchronous motors</a> are current-energized, meaning that their rotational speed is based on the amount of electrical energy applied — rather than relying on permanent magnets to generate the magnetic field turns the wheels.

A full charge (0-100 percent capacity) on an 11W AC plug will take around 10.5 hours to complete (or a whopping 33 hours at 3.7 kW). Charging up to 80 percent on a DC fast charger will take 97 minutes at 50 kW, 40 minutes at 120 kW or just 35 minutes if you&#39;re lucky enough to find a charging station outfitted with it a 250kW port (note that the M60&#39;s 369V architecture limits its DC charging rate to 195 kW even if you do get lucky with an ultrafast station).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/818b4090-6d9e-11ec-9f6f-5d5402e2ab1f" alt="iX M60 brake caliper" data-uuid="787ec129-9d9f-3291-9b95-1de61d056417"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>Outwardly, the M60 is quite similar to the iX. It measures 195 x 77 x 65 inches and incorporates an aluminum space frame and carbon cage with carbon fiber reinforced plastic in the roof, side and rear. But if you look closer, you&#39;ll notice M60-exclusive blue brake calipers and optional 22-inch rims.

That includes a Bowers &amp; Wilkins Diamond surround sound system, a panoramic &quot;Sky Lounge&quot; LED roof, adaptive LED headlights and myriad driver and traffic monitoring sensors, and something called BMW Natural Interaction, which allows you to control the infotainment system with verbal commands and hand gestures.&nbsp;</p><p>Pricing for the M60 will start at $106,095 when the orders begin this June.

Among the models the company is updating are its popular Stealth GS77 and Stealth <a href="https://www.engadget.com/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-180001632.html">GS66 laptops</a>. New to the 2022 versions of the laptop is a more durable zinc alloy hinge. They also feature larger trackpads and keycaps for a more comfortable typing experience. Between the Stealth GS77 and Stealth GS66, MSI will offer 10 different configurations.</p><p>With the latter, the most affordable model will cost $1,799 and feature an Intel Core i7-12650H processor, NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of NVMe storage. It also comes with a 17-inch 360Hz Full HD display. If you want MSI’s most powerful GS77 model, you’ll need to set aside $4,199. That gets you a computer with a 14-core, 20-thread i9-12900H; NVIDIA’s new flagship laptop GPU, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3070-ti-3080-ti-laptop-gpu-ces-announcement-163355552.html"><ins>RTX 3080 Ti</ins></a>; 32GB of RAM; and a 1TB M.2 drive. Instead of a Full HD or QHD panel, it comes with a 4K 120Hz display that covers the entire Adobe RGB color gamut.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Moving to the smaller GS66, your most affordable option here is a $2,499 model with an i9-12900H, RTX 3070 Ti, 32GB of RAM, 1TB of internal storage and a 15-inch 360Hz Full HD display. For $1,000 more, you can get the computer with an RTX 3080 Ti, 32GB of RAM and 4K display.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a1d6910-6d9f-11ec-bbcf-2beeed5c38a9" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="MSI Stealth GS77" data-uuid="f89a9190-037c-38f5-a265-350db3f2aa84"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MSI</div></figure><p>If one of MSI’s new computers comes with at least an RTX 3070 and Core i7 processor, it will feature a “Meta-Ready” sticker on its case to tell you you’re ready to experience the Metaverse at its best.

The Core i9 Stealth GS77 will come with a metal pad that melts when the computer reaches a temperature of 136 degrees Fahrenheit. The liquid fills the space between the CPU and thermal block, leading to a more efficient transfer of heat, according to MSI.

Think of it like a souped-up Surface Pro: the Z13 packs in Intel&#39;s new 12th-gen processors and up to NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 3050 Ti all in a sleek slate. Weighing in at 2.43 pounds, it&#39;s clearly not meant to replace smaller tablets like the iPad. Instead, ASUS sees it as a way to bring your PC games everywhere — say a cramped airplane tray table — without the bulk of a laptop.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="1cbbee32-bcf2-4579-9646-6424392f7f52"/><p>Like the ROG Flow X13, the Z13 can connect to the ASUS XG Mobile external GPU, which supports up to AMD&#39;s Radeon RX 6850M in addition to NVIDIA&#39;s mobile RTX 30-series lineup. That eGPU still relies on a custom PCIe connection, which can reach up to 63 Gbps of graphics bandwidth, making it more capable than Thunderbolt 4&#39;s 40 Gbps. I was wary of the XG Mobile last year, given just how expensive and flaky similar eGPUs have been. And that was before we learned it would cost $1,500 with the 3080, and that it <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/asus-rog-xg-mobile">wasn&#39;t nearly as fast as reviewers would have liked</a>. At the very least, the Z13 promises to be a better performer than the X13 with its built-in hardware, so maybe an eGPU would be unnecessary.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In person, the Z13 is exactly what you&#39;d expect from an ROG gaming laptop to look like. The preview unit ASUS sent for me to borrow felt dense and sturdy, surprisingly so for its 12 millimeter thickness. Unlike iPads and other tablets, it feels strong enough to survive a backpack commute without a protective case. From the front, you could easily mistake it for a notebook. From the sides and back though, it&#39;s more like a Super Surface, with a flexible kickstand and keyboard cover.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a80-6c41-11ec-bfdf-5bdcc1ffcee2" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13" data-uuid="21df3f12-a124-3d12-9bd9-639827bf1196"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I wasn&#39;t able to run any games and benchmarks on the ROG Z13, unfortunately. (I&#39;d wager ASUS&#39;s software and drivers aren&#39;t ready for serious testing yet.) But I could see why it could be compelling: An RTX 3050 Ti in a machine this size would be a dream for travel (at least, when that&#39;s safe again). And its 4K 13-inch display was perfectly fine for productivity tasks (there&#39;s also a 1080p 120Hz option). Given its size, though, the Z13 felt too heavy to use as a standard tablet. It&#39;s also not nearly as &quot;lappable&quot; as the Surface Pro devices; it&#39;s just too heavy to stay put while you&#39;re typing.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a82-6c41-11ec-aa7f-cd1bdc13a6cc" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13 keyboard" data-uuid="c1f4e5f1-5b26-3cc8-b0b5-09f303cfc6c8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>ASUS deserves credit for actually including the keyboard case with the Z13, something Microsoft still refuses to do with the Surface Pro. And the typing experience actually feels pretty decent, so long as the Z13 is planted firmly on a flat surface. I could see it being a solid option for casual gaming, but the WASD inputs don&#39;t feel nearly as responsive as a basic desktop gaming keyboard. Basically, if you&#39;re expecting to compete while using the Z13, plan to bring along a separate keyboard.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c9f9e1b7af754c33a58b8217c31ad57b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a81-6c41-11ec-bbdf-8d13a34be0a3" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13 from the side"></section><p>You&#39;ll likely be able to connect most of your accessories to the Z13 as well, since it includes both a USB 2.0 Type-A connection, as well two USB 3.2 Type-C ports (one is hidden under the XG Mobile connection. There&#39;s also a microSD card slot, which is useful for throwing in additional storage or offloading media.</p><p>Without knowing the ROG Z13&#39;s price and testing it properly, it&#39;s hard to make any final judgements. Personally, I think most consumers would be better off investing in a gaming notebook, which would have bigger screens, faster hardware and more capable keyboards. But ASUS already makes plenty of those, including our beloved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-190037967.html">Zephyrus G14</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g-15-review-2021-gaming-laptop-150044817.html">G15</a>. The Z13, which is expected to land in the first half of 2022, is clearly meant for gamers who prioritize portability more than anything else. For them, this might be the tablet of their dreams.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-200004888.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c13b8ba1-22f3-44c4-b115-6281f1ef272d</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641326677</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T11:44:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a80-6c41-11ec-ab3f-034430a27c9b" width="2000" height="1268" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a80-6c41-11ec-ab3f-034430a27c9b" width="2000" height="1268" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Flow Z13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Flow Z13]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
