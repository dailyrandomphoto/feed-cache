Valve is apparently planning to give it the ability to bring up two SteamVR menu options: prism and standalone system layer. The latter, as you may have guessed, implies that the device could work on its own without the need to be tethered to a PC. If you&#39;ll recall, Valve&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html">Index VR headset</a> released in 2019 has to be attached to a computer to work. The YouTube host also discovered a mention of Deckard in a SteamVR Linux ARM binary. That particular evidence hints at processing power built into a Valve VR headset, further solidifying the possibility that it&#39;s a standalone device.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to<em> Ars Technica&#39;s </em>sources, Valve was developing two design concepts for a virtual reality headset. One of them ended up resembling the Index in that it needs to connect to a PC and to SteamVR Tracking Boxes. The other ended up being designed around a built-in processor with inside-out tracking like the Oculus Quest. Those sources also hinted that Valve had to bring in an outside firm to develop inside-out tracking that could match what the Quest can do.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether the standalone VR headset will ever be released remains to be seen. As the publication notes, Valve is already preparing to start shipping the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html">Steam Deck</a> in December. With the current chip shortage affecting the tech and auto industries today, we may have to wait quite a bit for Deckard if Valve decides to release it at all.</p><div id="2cab72202c95443eb59e8628c4483f03"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp42lQYVzwo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valve-standalone-vr-headset-report-120909267.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f645a2ba-6fb4-479f-90cf-feaaa62f9ba4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 12:09:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632917384</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T12:09:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5f5bbf30-2119-11ec-b7ff-71553085a9ff" width="1600" height="923" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5f5bbf30-2119-11ec-b7ff-71553085a9ff" width="1600" height="923" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Valve]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Valve]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Amazon reveals its periscope-equipped Alexa robot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon’s annual barrage of new Echo hardware didn’t disappoint, ranging from role-playing games to nutrition tracking, drones and videocall devices for kids. I think the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-161730394.html">15-inch Echo Show</a>, a smart screen to mount on your wall, was the most intriguing reveal.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-161730394.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0e506340-2112-11ec-9f6b-531644d47fb0" style="height:380;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="469ad3d9-259d-3f24-8e5a-bbe332b97bb8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure></a><p>Amazon has redesigned its home screen to make the most of all that extra display space, and you can customize it so part of the screen scrolls through ambient content, like headlines and weather updates. Aimed at families, the Echo Show 15 also has a new visual ID feature that can recognize your face and show you personalized information, like calendar appointments, reminders and notes.</p><p>Amazon and Google dominate the smart displays space, and I might be the rare exception of having not a single Alexa-powered device in my home. So far, Amazon’s devices haven’t offered anything particularly compelling for me. I have a Google smart display, which smoothly integrates with Google Calendar, Google Maps and the rest. It’s hard for me to generate much enthusiasm for the Echo range.</p><p>Now, having said that, let me contradict myself entirely.</p><p>If you like your Alexa devices on wheels and with precarious extendable, periscope cameras, then perhaps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">Amazon’s Astro robot</a> might get you excited. (Or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-police-state-robots-personal-security-dystopia-203641655.html https://www.engadget.com/...">worried</a>.) Amazon plans to sell its first robot in limited quantities later this year. It will eventually cost $1,450, but as part of its Day 1 Editions program, the company will sell the robot at an introductory price of $1,000.</p><p></p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h3>All the big Amazon news</h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-blink-video-doorbell-floodlight-camera-170141201.html"><ins>Amazon&#39;s Blink unveils a no-frills $50 video doorbell</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-60-dollar-alexa-powered-thermostat-161738943.html"><ins>Amazon&#39;s Alexa-enabled Smart Thermostat only costs $60</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-nutrition-164816502.html"><ins>Amazon takes on Apple with fitness and nutrition services for Halo devices</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-2021-hardware-event-roundup-195702185.html"><ins>Everything Amazon announced at its September hardware event</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-glow-announcement-164412809.html"><ins>Amazon Glow is a kid-focused video call device with interactive activities</ins></a></p><p></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-customizable-sonos-symfonisk-130025280.html">IKEA’s new customizable Sonos speaker lamp launches October 12th</a></h2><h3>Starting from $169, depending on the shade.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-customizable-sonos-symfonisk-130025280.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0e66f880-2112-11ec-bdbf-ae1e4355bafe" style="height:441;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="328e540c-c61a-389e-b8e4-70e9a13d5ab1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure></a><p>IKEA and Sonos’ new, more customizable version of their Symfonisk speaker lamp arrives on October 12th.

It only grew stronger as <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-devices-services-news-september-2021">the event</a> progressed, with many new Amazon products seeming incredibly familiar. The company has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peak-design-amazon-video-175235085.html">criticized in the past</a> for borrowing designs of popular goods and selling them for a lot cheaper.</p><p>That’s not an uncommon practice of course — massive retailers all over America like Walmart and Costco have offered lower-cost store-brand lines forever. But none of them stage flashy keynotes to tout their products as “innovations.” While Amazon has indeed brought certain unique technologies to the world in the past, this year the company’s “innovations” seemed to be more of it doing what it does best: undercutting the rest.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Halo View: Twinning with Fitbit</h2><p>With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-view-price-163738227.html">the Halo View</a>, Amazon is essentially adding a display to its existing screenless health-tracking band. But the View’s shape and style are so similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-eda-sensors-heart-stress-i-h-130058156.html">Fitbit’s Charge series</a> it’s hard to differentiate the two. Sure, there are only so many ways you can stick a rectangular display on a wristband, but Amazon’s mimicry doesn’t stop there. It also introduced new Halo Fitness and Halo Nutrition services today that will offer guides on working out and eating better.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/50269ed0-207a-11ec-b5f7-3e575d322de7" alt="Amazon Halo View" data-uuid="1880500c-375f-3ee2-8ffa-5f360311fa39"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>That’s basically Fitbit Premium, which offers guides on working out and eating better. Oh and Fitbit’s $10-a-month service also provides tips on meditating and sleep. Amazon’s subscription costs just $4 per month after a trial period, though, and the $80 Halo View is $100 cheaper than the new Charge 5. The View probably won’t do as much as Fitbit’s trackers, which are quite sophisticated. Still, considering the price, Amazon will likely sell a lot of them.</p><h2>Amazon Smart Thermostat: Lose the frills for a fraction of the price</h2><p>Amazon teamed up with existing thermostat brand Honeywell to make a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-60-dollar-alexa-powered-thermostat-161738943.html">Smart Thermostat</a> that will work with most existing 24V HVACs (most common for residential HVAC systems). You can control it with a separate Alexa-enabled device and set custom routines for heating and cooling. The company hasn’t released much more information about its thermostat yet, but from what we can see, the device has the rounded-rectangle shape of an ecobee smart thermostat with the color scheme of a Google Nest product.</p><p>Lots of existing smart thermostats by brands like ecobee, Sensibo and Google’s Nest do more things, but Amazon is seriously undercutting the competition by selling its version for just $60. The Nest Thermostat that was launched last year costs $130, while an <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/en-us/smart-thermostats/smart-wifi-thermostat/">ecobee 3 Lite goes for $170</a>.</p><h2>Blink cameras: Competing with Google for much cheaper</h2><p>Competition in the security camera space is pretty stiff, so it isn’t very surprising that Amazon and Google both borrow a lot from each other. Amazon unveiled a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-blink-video-doorbell-floodlight-camera-170141201.html">new $50 Blink video doorbell camera</a> today, alongside a set of outdoor cameras. One of these is the $40 floodlight camera mount that calls to mind <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-doorbell-camera-battery-powered-floodlight-130016075.html">Google’s Nest Cam with integrated floodlight</a>. To be fair, though, Google did only introduce a wireless, battery-powered doorbell camera after Blink, so it appears the borrowing is mutual here.</p><p>The difference, however, is once again in pricing. Blink’s video doorbell is less than a third of the price of the $180 Nest Doorbell. Google’s floodlight-cum-security camera is $280, while Amazon’s mount (with a camera) is <em>half</em> that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094YXVVRF">at $140</a>.</p><h2>But at what cost?</h2><p>It’s no secret that Amazon’s business model has a lot to do with knowing what people want and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-price-changes-2018-8">changing their prices accordingly</a>. But how can it <a href="https://www.thelist.com/412459/the-real-reason-amazon-essentials-products-are-so-cheap/">make things so cheap</a>? In addition to pure economies of scale and multiple reports of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/18/magazine/amazon-workers-employees-covid-19.html">questionable (at best) labor practices</a>, the company also offers goods at reduced prices in exchange for sticking ads on your devices. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ask/questions/Tx1YQ0NCUZZMIZF/">ad-supported versions of Kindles</a> and Fire tablets often go for $20 to $30 less than their stock counterparts.</p><p>With the breadth of devices Amazon offers, too, the sheer amount of data it could collect purely for the sake of selling you stuff is huge. With the smart thermostat, it could detect a dip in temperature in your region and suggest you buy from its in-house brand of winter wear. Or maybe your child’s been reading a book on a Kindle, and the company later serves ads for collectibles from that title on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-glow-announcement-164412809.html">new kid-centric Glow video-calling device</a>. Or how about a subsidized version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">the Astro robot</a> that roams your house or follows you around with an ad on its face? Amazon also talked about a “vision of ambient intelligence” — which sounds very similar to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yexspE0prM">concept of “ambient computing”</a> expounded <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-15-google-nest-smart-home-fix-plan.html">by Google for years</a>. But because Amazon’s products are so much cheaper, it could succeed at stuffing Alexa in so many more places in our lives.</p><p>Plus, with all the data it’s gathering from your shopping habits, whether it’s on one of its devices or the Amazon app, the company can afford to sell you something at a lower profit margin. The company said in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ">its privacy notice that</a> it’s “not in the business of selling our customers&#39; personal information to others.” But it’s presumably using that data to understand the types of things you’re more likely to buy and put that stuff in front of you. It’ll probably make more off of you in the long run if you’re using the cheap Fire tablet to browse its store.</p><p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that <em>everything</em> Amazon unveiled today was a cutrate version of something else. We got an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-always-home-cam-beta-test-invite-only-163911030.html">update on the Ring Always Home Cam</a>, which was first announced last year. You’ll soon be able to sign up to test it out. The home security device is a little drone that can fly around your property at your command to see if anything’s amiss. No mainstream tech giant has launched something similar yet, though, so Amazon isn’t undercutting anyone on this.</p><p>Still, it seems like the company’s strategy for its flagship products is similar to that of its Basics line: Take a good idea, tweak it and sell it for loads cheaper. It’s not terrible; We could always use affordable, reliable devices.

The move comes weeks after the country&#39;s high court <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/australias-top-court-finds-media-companies-liable-for-other-peoples-facebook-comments-11631096115?mod=article_inline">ruled</a> that media companies are liable for the comments left by other people on their Facebook posts. A <em>CNN</em> spokesperson told the publication that users in Australia will no longer be able to see its main Facebook page, its CNN International page and the dedicated pages for its shows.&nbsp;</p><p>Dylan Voller <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/24/technology/facebook-australia-comments.html">filed</a> the original case that prompted Australia&#39;s courts to decide whether media organizations should be liable for comments left on their Facebook pages. Voller became famous back in 2016 after a TV exposé on the mistreatment of minors in the criminal detention system showed a photo of him hooded and strapped to a chair when he was only 17. Major news outlets used that photo for their articles that were then posted on Facebook, where commenters falsely accused Voller of serious crimes, such as raping an elderly woman.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A <em>CNN</em> source told <em>The Journal</em> that the organization asked Facebook if it would help media companies disable comments entirely. However, the social network reportedly declined to disable all comments on <em>CNN&#39;s</em> pages in Australia. Facebook rolled out a tool back in March that allows celebrities, politicians and news outlets to restrict who can comment on their pages, but they&#39;d still have to set a restriction for every post. <em>CNN</em> has decided that doing so for all its properties would be time-consuming and opted to completely block Australia instead.</p><p>A <em>CNN</em> spokesperson said:</p><blockquote><p>“We are disappointed that Facebook, once again, has failed to ensure its platform is a place for credible journalism and productive dialogue around current events among its users.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As for Facebook, it told <em>The Journal</em> that it supports the reform of Australia&#39;s defamation laws. In addition, it said it provided <em>CNN</em> with features it can use to manage comments and that it continues to &quot;provide Australians a destination for quality journalism, including through Facebook News which we launched in August.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, Australia also passed a law that requires tech giants to pay news outlets for using their content. As a response, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-australia-news-ban-took-down-government-pages-045625746.html">blocked</a> Australian publishers and residents from sharing news content. It quickly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-australia-news-043441256.html">rolled back</a> the ban, however, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/16/977776254/facebook-reaches-deal-with-news-corp-australia-to-pay-for-news-content">agreed to pay</a> some news organizations for their content.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cnn-restricts-access-facebook-pages-australia-083645494.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fecd6b5b-a8fa-405c-9215-15aa924955e2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 08:36:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632904639</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T08:37:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/2a7fbe50-a28f-11eb-9bfd-fa2ef8df286c" width="3012" height="2008" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/2a7fbe50-a28f-11eb-9bfd-fa2ef8df286c" width="3012" height="2008" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Feb 16, 2020 Menlo Park / CA / USA - Girl posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign, located at the entrance to the company's main headquarters, Silicon Valley]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Girl posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple says the iPad mini's 'jelly scrolling' problem is normal]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Shortly after the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html">iPad mini</a> was released, people started complaining about seeing a weird &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6-jelly-scrolling-200628505.html">jelly-like</a>&quot; effect on their screens while scrolling. It appears as if one side of the screen scrolls at a different rate than the other, making it look like the screen is wobbling. Those who were hoping for a fix to the problem would probably be disappointed by Apple&#39;s response, because the tech giant has told <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/2021-ipad-mini-suffers-from-uneven-jelly-scrolling-in-portrait-mode/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> that the device&#39;s screen wobbling problem isn&#39;t a problem at all.</p><p>A spokesperson told the publication that the jelly-like effect people are seeing is typical for LCD screens, because they refresh line by line. As such, it&#39;s normal for the lines at the top of the display to refresh at a different rate than the lines at the bottom. <em>Ars Technica</em> insists, though, that the effect is much noticeable on the iPad mini than it is on other 60Hz LCD iPads, including the latest entry-level model that was released with the mini. Further, there&#39;s a visible line dividing the screen in the middle when the tablet is in portrait mode.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It remains to be seen whether Apple would do something about this jelly scrolling effect in the future, considering people are airing complaints about it. For now, it looks the tech giant&#39;s stance is that it&#39;s par for the course for an LCD screen and that users will just have to get used to it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-jelly-scrolling-problem-response-073027688.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca92c182-583d-4519-a2ea-a0ee983ad655</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 07:30:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632899766</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T07:16:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ea139ff0-20ef-11ec-bdde-6c9e8138e6c8" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ea139ff0-20ef-11ec-bdde-6c9e8138e6c8" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Withings puts its heart-monitoring ScanWatch in the body of a diver’s watch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Withings is today launching the ScanWatch Horizon, a dolled-up version of its ScanWatch inside the body of a diving watch. Horizon comes in a bigger, 43mm case size, but is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-scanwatch-hands-on-ifa-2020-070001875.html">otherwise the same device we already think is the best hybrid on the market</a>. That includes the built-in ECG, blood oxygen sensor and sleep apnea tracking, as well as the usual activity and sleep-monitoring features. You’ll also get the same pair of sub dials, one with a small digital screen for notifications, the other an analog activity counter.</p><p>At an event in Paris, we got a chance to see the ScanWatch Horizon and try it on, though it was a non-functional prototype. It&#39;s certainly as pretty in person as the photos show, and with the steel quick-release band, feels nice considering the price. For the first time, Withings will sell the ScanWatch Horizon at jewelers on top of other retail locations.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="9bb9e9b3-dade-44b4-aa29-58809b6f0f59"/><p>The company told Engadget that the chunkier Horizon model has a more &quot;masculine&quot; design for larger wrists, with only a 43mm model available. The original ScanWatch, by contrast, came in sizes ranging from 38mm to 42mm.</p><p>Sadly, the beefier body and higher price hasn’t added anything to the feature list, and so there’s no GPS on this watch unless your phone comes along for the ride. And, if we’re nit-picking, we can say that while it’s dressed to impress as a diving watch (with an accurate laser-engraved rotating bezel and Luminova watch hands) water resistance is limited to 10ATM. That allows for snorkeling, water activities and some scuba diving, but it isn&#39;t much compared to most serious diving watches.</p><p>That said, the smartwatch world is crying out for anything that matches premium diving watch styling with a hint of smarts. It can’t be that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-tag-heuer-connected-series-3.html">TAG Heuer’s Connected</a> is allowed to become the default in this market by default, especially since it’s running, you know, <em>Wear OS</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/54caa070-20f3-11ec-befd-dcadfb6693aa" alt="Withings puts its heart-monitoring ScanWatch in the body of a diver&#x002019;s watch" data-uuid="491c4b5f-d67e-3594-8c20-f908a85d5f2f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Withings told Engadget that FDA approval of its ECG health sensor is holding back the ScanWatch Horizon&#39;s release in the US, but it&#39;s hoping to bring it stateside by the end of the year. That&#39;s also why the original ScanWatch has yet to go on sale in the US, in case you were wondering.&nbsp;</p><p>As for when you can get one of these on your wrist, the ScanWatch Horizon will first launch in the UK from September 29th, priced at £499.95 / €499.95. Buyers will be able to choose the Blue or Green face color, and both models will ship with a quick-release stainless steel and an FKM rubber band (for swimming). It also arrives today in France and Germany, and you can expect it to pop up a bit later elsewhere in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Steve Dent contributed to this report.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/withings-scanwatch-horizon-divers-watch-070020840.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">69f9d14b-3a4b-4faf-94cc-10ba0f22a8af</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper,Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Sep 2021 07:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632901575</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T07:46:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d616d660-20f5-11ec-b697-d45dd503a34a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d616d660-20f5-11ec-b697-d45dd503a34a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hands-on image of the Withings ScanWatch Horizon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Withings ScanWatch Horizon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arturia announces MiniFuse lineup of affordable audio interfaces]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Arturia already has a lineup of audio interfaces. They&#39;re fairly well regarded. But one thing they&#39;re not, is cheap. The base model <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/audiofuse/overview">AudioFuse</a> is $699. It is <em>not</em> for the casual bedroom producer. But, the company knows that the more people making music, the bigger its customer base, so serving that entry level is important. The MiniFuse line is the answer to that need.&nbsp;</p><p>The lineup of three models starts at $99 for the <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/minifuse/minifuse1#en">MiniFuse 1</a>. It&#39;s the most basic of the new devices with a single combo input for XLR and 1/4-inch instruments. But it has the same preamps, 110db dynamic range, five-year warranty and software bundle as the rest of the lineup. All the MiniFuses can also act as USB hubs, so you can connect a controller through the interface and save some port space on your PC. What you lose mostly by opting for the most affordable option is the MIDI in and out ports. You also can&#39;t blend direct monitoring with the USB output, you can only switch between the two.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="64f8080fcfc64f3a9e55920f17389f94"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pe04RI1erIQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The $149 <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/minifuse/minifuse2#en">MiniFuse 2</a> adds a second input, MIDI in and out ports and has a mix control for balancing between direct monitoring of your input and what&#39;s coming out of your PC. This is handy for recording live audio when even the tiniest of latency is unacceptable.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/minifuse/minifuse4#en">MiniFuse 4</a> hasn&#39;t gotten a price tag yet, and wont be shipping until next year. But it has line inputs around the back, two additional audio outputs and an additional headphone jack so you and a collaborator can both monitor a track together without filling your recording space with more noise. If you use a decent amount of outboard gear or frequently work with a vocalist this is probably the way to go. The extra outputs and inputs are especially handy for routing audio out of your computer, processing it with external effects then running it back into your DAW for final mixing.&nbsp;</p><p>The MiniFuse line comes with a solid bundle of software including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-daw-hands-on-review-upgrades-explained-160047192.html">Ableton Live</a> Lite, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-v-collection-8-analog-lab-v-hands-on-softsynth-vst-173441647.html">Analog Lab</a> Intro, a bundle of four <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-fx-collection-2-22-plugins-youll-actually-use-vst-170115595.html">Arturia FX</a>, Native Instruments Guitar Rig 6 LE and three month subscriptions to both Auto-Tune Unlimited and Splice.</p><p>The MiniFuse 1 and MiniFuse 2 are available to pre order now and will start shipping in November.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-announces-mini-fuse-lineup-of-affordable-audio-interfaces-204411420.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aea789a7-9ec6-414a-af7e-226046d23733</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 22:55:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632864206</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T21:23:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e29ff600-2096-11ec-afe9-cea78c978084" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e29ff600-2096-11ec-afe9-cea78c978084" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arturia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arturia MiniFuse]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arturia MiniFuse]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix buys 'Oxenfree' developer Night School Studio]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The team behind hit indie game <em>Oxenfree </em>is joining Netflix, marking the first time the streaming giant has acquired a game developer.

Lucid Motors said it has <a href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-starts-production-deliveries-begin-october">started</a> production of the luxury EV and expects to deliver the first Dream Edition models in late October. There will only be 520 Dream units (conveniently a match for the car&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucids-longest-range-air-ev-has-a-prodigious-520-miles-of-epa-range-123000043.html">520-mile estimated range</a>). However, Lucid won&#39;t be hurting for early customers. Even if only some of the 13,000 reservation holders commit to a purchase, that&#39;s a significant volume for an upscale car from a relatively new brand.</p><p>Those numbers might climb. The fledgling automaker plans a rapid expansion that will add about 65 acres (2.85 million square feet) to its Casa Grande, Arizona factory. It may need the extra output, too. Lucid plans to mass-produce its first SUV, the Gravity, in 2023, and electric SUVs have lately been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-2020-production-half-million-cars-154826010.html">in high demand</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Air starts at $77,400. In addition to its potentially Tesla-beating range, it promises rare perks like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-dolby-atmos-160018074.html">Dolby Atmos audio</a>, very quick charging (20 minutes for 300 miles) and a 34-inch cockpit display.</p><p>There&#39;s no guarantee Lucid will succeed when competing against Tesla, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">Rivian</a> and rapidly electrifying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fords-mach-e-is-a-stylish-and-capable-ev-but-its-no-mustang-153044259.html">incumbent car brands</a>. While its strategy is familiar to Tesla fans (its first truly large-scale EV was also a luxury sedan), Lucid is entering a much more established market with competitors that have ample resources and name recognition. With that said, just making it to production is notable feat. EV startups like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/recordbreaking-faraday-future-prototype-evs-auction-211946137.html">Faraday Future</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-232701777.html">Lordstown Motors</a> are still struggling to reach that point, giving Lucid a considerable lead over some of its key rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-delivery-date-214305594.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb535e79-c5ae-45a4-9e25-3bc9278b3d6e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 21:43:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632864193</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T21:23:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8e192690-209d-11ec-9779-6c5dc1de838c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8e192690-209d-11ec-9779-6c5dc1de838c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucid Motors]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lucid Air EV in production at the Casa Grande, Arizona factory]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lucid Air EV in production at the Casa Grande, Arizona factory]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Amazon's entire new hardware event right here]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon tends to avoid livestreaming its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hardware-fall-2020-echo-ring-eero-012946012.html">big hardware events</a>, but it&#39;s happy to share video after the fact — and this year&#39;s presentation is one you might want to see.

It&#39;s essentially a tablet on wheels, roughly the size of a small dog, with cameras that allow it to detect anomalies in the house, record video, and send alerts to your phone. It also connects with Ring, Amazon&#39;s popular personal security system, allowing the robot to roll around on its own and proactively investigate odd events while the homeowners are away. Its name is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">Astro</a>. Yes, it has eyes.</p><p>Astro was the cap to an hour-long event that started with kids&#39; toys and health services, and ended in a stream of dystopian police-state devices, each presented with an Amazon-branded smile. There was the smart thermostat, the interactive camera for kids, and Amazon&#39;s own version of the Fitbit, followed by the Ring Always Home Cam, Ring Alarm Pro, Ring Virtual Security Guard, Blink Video Doorbell and floodlight cameras, and finally, Astro, the robot with an extendable arm that can record every inch of your house without any user input. Add a layer of ominous music that slowly creeps up in volume, and Amazon&#39;s show was an instant episode of <em>Black Mirror</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f28bdc20-2099-11ec-9fff-89bbc8de75ac" alt="Amazon Astro" data-uuid="953527f9-3e52-349b-8d60-1ca37bff317c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>In Amazon&#39;s vision of the future, homeowners are constantly watching their security cameras, tracking delivery people and spying on their dogs, heavily relying on the Ring ecosystem the entire time. Astro and the Ring Always Home Cam, Amazon&#39;s autonomous security drone, are the company&#39;s most visually striking devices, tapping into science-fiction dreams of robot butlers and AI-powered pets. They move on their own and stream data directly to the homeowner at any time, satiating the persistent breed of home-security paranoia generated by neighborhoods of curbside cameras and Nextdoor threads.</p><p>While the robots are the face of Amazon&#39;s in-home security business, Ring is the backbone. Ring has been leading the home-security charge in the United States since 2018, selling <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210512005336/en/Strategy-Analytics-Amazons-Ring-Remained-atop-the-Video-Doorbell-Market-in-2020">1.4 million doorbells</a> in 2020 alone and cornering 18 percent of the market overall. Unfortunately, Amazon has proven to be a near-sighted steward of this massive, unregulated residential surveillance system.&nbsp;</p><p>Since 2018, Ring has signed agreements with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-2000-police-fire-departments-213301374.html">more than 2,000 police departments</a> across the US, providing authorities with access to recordings from residential cameras, often without warrants and according to the company&#39;s own parameters. In <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests">May and June 2020</a>, for instance, the Los Angeles Police Department used the Ring ecosystem to request footage of Black Lives Matter protests from residential doorbell cameras, without noting a specific incident that was under investigation. That&#39;s a huge red flag, according to activist groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b141a570-2098-11ec-adbf-6763af19bb94" alt="Ring Always Home Cam" data-uuid="330f0cba-4187-3071-93e9-a2814428f8ec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>&quot;If police request hours of footage on either side of a specific incident, they may receive hours of people engaging in First Amendment protected activities with a vague hope that a camera may have captured illegal activity at some point,&quot; <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests">the EFF said</a> in February. The report continued, &quot;Technologies like Ring have the potential to provide the police with video footage covering nearly every inch of an entire neighborhood. This poses an incredible risk to First Amendment rights. People are less likely to exercise their right to political speech, protest, and assembly if they know that police can acquire and retain footage of them. This creates risks of retribution or reprisal, especially at protests against police violence. Ring cameras, ubiquitous in many neighborhoods, create the possibility that if enough people share footage with police, authorities are able to follow protestors’ movements, block by block.&quot;</p><p>As the number of police departments with Amazon contracts has skyrocketed, authorities themselves have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/ring-amazon-police-partnership-social-media-neighbor">pushing Ring devices</a> on the citizens they serve, using materials prepared by the company and earning incentives for getting folks to download Ring&#39;s Neighbors app. Amazon has effectively turned the US police force into its own mini marketing squad, blurring the lines between public safety and private-company loyalty.</p><p>On top of problematic police partnerships, the Ring ecosystem is filled with unchecked bias. A <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops">2019 study by <em>Motherboard</em></a> found people of color were disproportionately labeled as &quot;suspicious&quot; in the Neighbors app, a phenomenon that feeds into racism and hyper-vigilance, creating less-safe environments overall.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9a92a670-2099-11ec-bf9b-bd87c39b8ae7" alt="Ring" data-uuid="03d13dce-786b-323d-950d-a1469c886462"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Ring has taken steps to address some of these issues, such as changing the wording in the Neighbors app from &quot;suspicious&quot; to &quot;unexpected activity.&quot; Additionally, police will no longer be able to send bulk emails to Ring users who might have footage they want — instead, there&#39;s a portal on Neighbors where they can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-neighbors-app-request-for-assistance-posts-100025122.html">request footage publicly</a>. Of course, these aren&#39;t solutions. Changing a word does nothing to temper the breeding ground of suspicion and racism inherent in the Neighbors app, and making police requests public doesn&#39;t stop them from happening, warrantless and with broad boundaries that are still determined by Amazon, a massive ecommerce company.</p><p>&quot;The network is predicated on perpetuating irrational fear of neighborhood crime, often yielding disproportionate scrutiny against people of color, all for the purposes of selling more cameras,&quot; <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/ring-changed-how-police-request-door-camera-footage-what-it-means-and-doesnt-mean">the EFF said</a> in June. &quot;Ring does so through police partnerships, which now encompass 1 in every 10 police departments in the United States. At their core, these partnerships facilitate bulk requests from police officers to Ring customers for their camera footage, built on a growing Ring surveillance network of millions of public-facing cameras. EFF adamantly opposes these Ring-police partnerships and advocates for their dissolution.&quot;</p><p>As Amazon continues to build out its Ring ecosystem, police partnerships intact, it&#39;s clear that the company is not focused on rebuilding public policy, reducing crime or eliminating everyday racism. Amazon is focused on selling Ring cameras; Amazon is focused on making money. Personally, that doesn&#39;t make me feel safe.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-police-state-robots-personal-security-dystopia-203641655.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">efa5eb01-d37d-46b7-9b8e-7ed1438dcf8c</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 20:36:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632861702</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T20:41:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f738dee0-2098-11ec-9beb-c5ec108bc44c" width="3048" height="1890" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f738dee0-2098-11ec-9beb-c5ec108bc44c" width="3048" height="1890" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Astro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Astro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Here's everything Amazon announced at its September hardware event]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon held its annual fall hardware event on Tuesday. It&#39;s too bad the company didn&#39;t stream the proceedings to the public because it was jam-packed with announcements. We saw everything from new Echo devices to an Alexa-powered robot. But worry not, we have you covered. Here&#39;s everything the company announced today.</p><h2></h2><h2>Astro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcdd26d0-207f-11ec-afff-2ea66d38964e" alt="Amazon Astro" data-uuid="fef8f3a5-e563-32f7-9dbd-45d34201e21a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>In an event packed with offbeat products, Amazon saved its most unusual one for last. In <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">Astro</a>, the company has created an Alexa-powered robot that can move around your home. It has three primary functions. It can provide home security, check-in on loved ones and pets and offer Alexa functionality on the go. When it becomes available later this year, Astro will cost $999.99 before it eventually increases to $1449.99 at a later date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Echo Show 15</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f804be90-2091-11ec-9bff-700d0016980e" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="c9bee933-525b-3d79-a59d-e880c205ca43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Amazon is adding yet another model to its Echo Show family. Its latest addition features a 15.6-inch 1080p display that the company envisions you mounting on the wall in spaces like your home’s kitchen. New to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-161730394.html">Echo Show 15</a> is a redesigned home screen that emphasizes Alexa widgets. The smart display also features a camera and a new feature that will adjust the contents of the home screen to you when the device recognizes your face. Sales of the $250 Echo Show 15 will start later this year.</p><h2>Halo</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/85668d00-2091-11ec-8778-1184c4ce48dd" alt="Halo View" data-uuid="786b32f3-f7e0-337c-969c-6c3c79eec8c4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon had two major announcements related to its Halo fitness product. First, the company introduced its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-view-price-163738227.html">Halo View fitness band</a>. In short, Amazon essentially added an AMOLED color display to its Halo wearable and made the resulting device cheaper. It doesn’t come with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-platform-134146361.html">tone-detecting microphone</a> that made the company’s first foray into fitness wearables so controversial, but what it can do is track your heart rate, skin temperature, steps and more. Halo View isn’t available to purchase just yet, but it will cost $80 when it does become available.</p><p>Outside of new hardware, the company announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-nutrition-164816502.html">Halo Fitness and Halo Nutrition</a>, two new features that will come included with its yearly $80 Halo subscription. The former is an alternative to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-review-two-weeks-test-watch-music-workout-160058155.html">Apple Fitness+</a> and other similar services. The latter, meanwhile, includes personalized recipes and meal planning. Halo Fitness will roll out later this year, while Halo Nutrition will arrive at the start of 2022.</p><h2>Ring and Blink</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/25224640-2092-11ec-bdee-4e8c924e8725" alt="Blink Doorbell" data-uuid="650becd9-3466-31cd-8849-95bc33ad6c1a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon’s Ring and Blink home security subsidiaries had an entire segment dedicated to their products. Highlights from that section include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-eero-ring-alarm-pro-base-station-164341341.html">Ring Alarm Pro, a security system that includes Eero Mesh WiFi integration</a>, and Blink’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-blink-video-doorbell-floodlight-camera-170141201.html">$50 video doorbell</a>. Ring also announced it’s starting to accept sign-ups to test its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-always-home-cam-beta-test-invite-only-163911030.html">Always Home Cam</a> security drone, which it first announced this same time last year.</p><h2>Glow</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11322b10-2091-11ec-9e5f-2106b7bf1699" alt="Amazon Glow" data-uuid="ac09e982-89f5-3607-b613-52a5505fe293"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>The award for the second-most offbeat device Amazon announced at its annual event goes to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-glow-announcement-164412809.html">Glow</a>. It’s a teleconferencing display the company designed for kids. Glow includes a projector that can create a 19-inch touch-sensitive playspace for all the games and activities included with the device. Glow will cost $249.99 when it goes on sale in the next few weeks, but Amazon said that&#39;s just an introductory price.</p><h2>All the rest</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5ba3a200-2091-11ec-b7fb-a0dfaaf41aa8" alt="Amazon Smart Thermostat" data-uuid="d29e3ccd-a6fd-317d-94ac-b7cf250e3e41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon wouldn’t be Amazon if the company weren’t trying to create more affordable versions of some of the best-selling products on its marketplace. So it should come as no surprise it announced an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-60-dollar-alexa-powered-thermostat-161738943.html">Alexa-enabled smart thermostat</a> that only costs $60.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of new hardware, Tuesday’s event saw the company announce various updates for its Alexa. In brief, the company worked with Disney to make a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hey-disney-164025746.html">voice assistant</a> that will be available on Echo devices and Walt Disney World Resort hotel rooms. It also introduced a feature called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-together-service-171909617.html">Alexa Together</a> that turns an Echo speaker or smart display into an emergency support device for your family members. Lastly, the company is adding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-adding-offline-voice-recognition-to-alexa-devices-171145961.html">offline voice support for Alexa devices</a>.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon’s fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-2021-hardware-event-roundup-195702185.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8b0dacb1-3797-4d45-ac38-5c65273643ca</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:57:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632867565</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T22:19:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c03ef160-2091-11ec-89ef-210d717a39e2" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c03ef160-2091-11ec-89ef-210d717a39e2" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon family]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon family]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Some Xbox owners can now test cloud gaming on their consoles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is preparing to complete a large piece of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-hardware-game-pass-e3-2021-130019814.html">cloud gaming puzzle</a> when it brings the option <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-pass-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-173404923.html"><ins>to Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S sometime this holiday season</ins></a>. Starting today, though, a random group of Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha Insiders can try cloud gaming on their consoles. The test will expand to more Insiders and members of other preview rings in the coming weeks.</p><p>If you have access, you can try cloud gaming by looking for the cloud icon on titles in the Xbox Game Pass library. To see a full list of games you can stream, go to My Games &amp; Apps, then Full Library and Xbox Game Pass, and change the filter to Cloud Gaming. At the outset, you&#39;ll be able to play more than 100 games without having to download them — as long as you have a sturdy enough internet connection.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="eebe440949f44ed398701543d544aa59"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) for Console is coming to a random subset of Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxInsiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XboxInsiders</a> today!

You also can&#39;t make any in-game purchases while playing a cloud gaming title, but you can do so through the Store on your console or the web. Meanwhile, if you have installed a game on an external drive that isn&#39;t connected to your Xbox, you won&#39;t be able to play it over the cloud. That seems like an annoying bug but hey, that&#39;s what beta tests are for.</p><p>Don&#39;t fret too much if you don&#39;t have access just yet. Console cloud gaming should be available for all Game Pass Ultimate subscribers within the next few months, perhaps just in time to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-december-8th-launch-date-134031534.html"><em><ins>Halo Infinite</ins></em></a>.

The next time you deliver a presentation with Keynote, you&#39;ll be able to include live video feeds directly in the slides. You can resize the video feed and change the look with masks, frames, drop shadows and reflections.</p><p>With the Mac version of Keynote, you can add feeds from multiple external cameras, and share a connected iPhone or iPad screen, which could prove useful for interactive demos. There are more collaboration features too. A new multi-presenter function lets anyone control a shared slideshow and advance slides remotely using a Mac, iPhone or iPad. This could come in handy for group presentations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The changes to Pages are largely iPhone-focused. The Screen View feature arranges text, images and other aspects of the document into a single-column view. Apple has increased the text size, while images are sized to fit your phone&#39;s screen. You can also view tables by scrolling left and right. Users will still be able to edit documents as usual when Screen View is active. You don&#39;t need to do anything to set up the feature, and it works with all word processing documents. Apple says you can toggle off Screen View so you can see the proper layout before you&#39;re ready to share or print the document.</p><p>As for Numbers, you can now get to grips with pivot tables across Apple devices. You&#39;ll be able to summarize, group and rearrange data to spot and study trends and patterns. There are options to visualize the pivot tables with charts and to share pivot data without disclosing the source data. You can also import pivot tables from and export them to Microsoft Excel.</p><p>Elsewhere, there&#39;s a new chart type called radar charts. Apple says this &quot;makes it easy to visually compare multiple variables with similarities shown as overlapping areas, allowing differences and outliers to really stand out.&quot; There are new filters you can use to highlight unique entries or duplicate data.</p><p>All three apps now support Apple&#39;s new translation tools on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ios%2015">iOS 15</a>, iPadOS 15 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/macos%20monterey">macOS Monterey</a>. The latest versions of Keynote, Pages and Numbers are now available on the App Store and Mac App Store.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e9d66b20-2087-11ec-bf7f-0ef40271895e" style="height:497;width:653;" alt="The translation feature on Apple&#39;s Keynote app on macOS Monterey" data-uuid="699befaa-fce5-37a7-88c4-7927819a1d4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iwork-keynote-pages-numbers-live-video-182213376.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f93913a7-0097-46b3-ad64-a2966bab6482</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 18:22:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632853337</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T18:22:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Utility Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Loans]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d40824a0-2087-11ec-bedf-251f8d2bd710" width="980" height="551" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d40824a0-2087-11ec-bedf-251f8d2bd710" width="980" height="551" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iWork apps Keynote, Numbers and Pages]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iWork apps Keynote, Numbers and Pages]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft's Windows store is now open to third-party app stores]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft wasn&#39;t just indulging in wishful thinking when it said it wanted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-wants-steam-epic-in-windows-11-app-store-132411163.html">more third-party app stores</a> in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-hands-on-microsoft-insider-preview-215041175.html">Windows 11&#39;s</a> portal. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698196/microsoft-store-third-party-app-stores-epic-games-amazon">notes</a> that new Microsoft Store <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/09/28/microsoft-store-more-apps-more-open/">policies</a> now allow third-party storefront apps.

The so-called &quot;caregiver&quot; can see notifications and alerts when someone uses Alexa as a way of letting you know that someone they want to keep an eye on is up and about. It also lets the &quot;care receiver&quot; say &quot;Alexa, call for help&quot; and it&#39;ll contact the caregiver immediately. Amazon didn&#39;t charge for this, but today it&#39;s adding a new feature called Alexa Together to the service. It&#39;ll be a $20/month service that gives an aging family member 24/7 access to Urgent Response, which Amazon describes as a professional emergency help line.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexa Together will also make caregiving easier to share among multiple family members by letting multiple people be designated as support contacts for a single individual. Other features include support for third-party devices that can detect when someone has fallen at home, the ability to add contacts to an individual&#39;s Alexa account so they can make hands-free calls, and set reminders on someone else&#39;s device or link up a music service for them to play tunes through.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At a high level, it sounds like Alexa Together basically makes it easier for other people to manage a family member&#39;s Alexa-capable device so they use it more. And if they use it more, the caregiver will see that it&#39;s being used and know their family member is going about their normal day. It&#39;s a bit convoluted, but the 24/7 access to Urgent Response might be worth the $20 per month cost. Alexa Together will have a free six-month trial period (or one full year if you&#39;ve been using the Alexa Care Hub already) when it launches later this year.</p><div id="8d1e8626509643b48f8094a85a055d0f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alexa Together is designed to help aging family members feel more comfortable and confident living independently, and to give the entire family peace of mind.

The most interesting, by far, are the new privacy features coming to the latest Alexa devices. Soon, US customers can choose to have all of their voice commands processed on their Alexa devices. That means these audio clips won&#39;t be sent to the cloud and they&#39;ll be automatically deleted after the Alexa device processes them.</p><p>The online retailer has received much scrutiny over the years when it comes to the privacy implications of its smart speakers and displays. Back in 2019, Amazon added a toggle that let users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-03-amazon-alexa-review-opt-out-privacy.html">opt-out</a> of having their voice recordings and message transcripts &quot;manually reviewed,&quot; and before that, the company added an option to delete your entire voice history with one command. This new feature builds on that, but it seemingly will only work with the latest Echo devices with the AZ1 Neural Edge processor. According to Amazon, the feature will first be available on the 4th-generation Echo and the Echo Show 10, and will come to more devices in the future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most other new Alexa features are only available on Amazon&#39;s smart displays, like the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-161730394.html">Echo Show 15</a>. First, Sling TV will be coming to all Echo Show devices soon, adding to the already lengthy list of streaming services accessible from Amazon&#39;s displays. Second, Echo devices with cameras will be able to use Visual ID, a feature that lets Alexa recognize you when you&#39;re in the camera&#39;s field of view. By knowing who&#39;s in front of the camera, the device&#39;s display can then present personalized information like calendar alerts and TV show preferences. It&#39;s important to note that Visual ID is something you have to enroll in — not an automatic feature — and you can delete your Visual ID at any time.</p><p>Amazon&#39;s also revamping <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Care Hub service" href="https://amzn.to/3zTsFvr">Care Hub</a>, which connects caregivers and their loved ones using the Alexa app and compatible devices, into a new subscription service called Alexa Together. This essentially lets caregivers check in on others remotely and set up things like alerts, emergency contact information and more. It includes features like Urgent Response, which gives you access to a professional emergency help line, and Remote Assist, which lets caregivers do things like set reminders, link music services and more to make things easier for their loved ones. Alexa Together will be available later this year for $20 per month, and current Care Hub customers can get one year of the service free.</p><p>Finally, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hey-disney-164025746.html">Amazon partnered with Disney</a> to bring a new voice assistant to its smart devices. &quot;Hey, Disney&quot; is the entertainment giant&#39;s own assistant that&#39;s built on on Amazon&#39;s Alexa technology. In addition to giving you access to characters from the Disney universe to chat with, the new assistant will also be able to set timers, reminders, check the weather and more. Echo users will be able to purchase the &quot;Hey, Disney&quot; assistant from the Alexa Skills store in 2022, and it will be available on Echo devices in Walt Disney World Resort hotel rooms.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon’s fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-adding-offline-voice-recognition-to-alexa-devices-171145961.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">950a9825-feb4-44f8-ac18-a33aa95b9565</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 17:11:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632918023</ingested><modified>2021-09-29T12:20:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/2f844110-cdea-11eb-bded-3d9cdc0c6b11" width="1920" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/2f844110-cdea-11eb-bded-3d9cdc0c6b11" width="1920" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 8]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 8]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Blink unveils a no-frills $50 video doorbell]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s Blink has developed a reputation for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-blink-mini-camera-announcement-183048551.html">low-cost security cameras</a>, and that now extends to your front door. The brand has unveiled a Blink Video Doorbell that, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:at $50" href="https://amzn.to/3ASZPNo">at $50</a>, could be a solid option if you&#39;re not interested in some of the frills available <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-smart-doorbell-alexa-radar-birds-eye-view-motion-detection-143037689.html">from Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">rival brands</a>. It &#39;only&#39; captures 1080p video, but it supports Alexa integration (of course), your choice of wired or wireless connections and the option to store footage on a USB thumb drive (when attached to a Sync Module 2) if you don&#39;t want a subscription for cloud storage.</p><p>Two AA batteries will keep the doorbell running for up to two years, although that&#39;s with a wired connection. Blink didn&#39;t say how long the Video Doorbell would last on a wireless link, but it&#39;s safe to presume you&#39;ll be swapping cells more often.

Amazon is working on an Alexa-powered robot on wheels. At its fall hardware event, the company showed off <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Astro" href="https://amzn.to/3CSlVQp">Astro</a>. Set to initially cost $1,000 when it becomes available later this year, it&#39;s essentially an Alexa display that can roam around your home.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/meet-astro-a-home-robot-unlike-any-other">robot</a> features a periscope camera that allows it to expand its field of view beyond floor level. It can extend that camera to check on things like stovetops and sleeping pets. With Ring&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-eero-ring-alarm-pro-base-station-164341341.html">Protect Pro</a> subscription service, you can also program Astro to patrol your home while you&#39;re away. It can detect the sound of a smoke alarm, carbon monoxide detector or breaking glass. It will send you notifications when it notices something usual, and you can save what it records to your Ring account.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcdd26d0-207f-11ec-afff-2ea66d38964e" alt="Amazon Astro" data-uuid="fef8f3a5-e563-32f7-9dbd-45d34201e21a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Naturally, you can issue it all the usual voice commands supported by Alexa. That means you can also use it in conjunction with Amazon&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-together-service-171909617.html">Alexa Together</a> feature, allowing your family members to contact you in case of an emergency. And if you&#39;re the type of person that likes to walk around when you&#39;re on a call, Astro can follow you around the house during video calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So how does Amazon plan to convince you to allow a moving camera into your home? Well, aside from the Wall-E eyes, you can put Astro in a do not disturb mode that limits how much it moves during the day or night. Additionally, the company says you can set out-of-bounds zones to prevent the robot from entering specific rooms or areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3e88d3e0-2080-11ec-b6fb-70ecfb3920fd" alt="Amazon Astro" data-uuid="9ee93b4b-d5e4-37e1-9385-45d243ec7e28"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Astro is one of those projects Amazon has reportedly been working on for years. The fact Amazon finally decided to show the device off comes as something of a surprise. Leading up to today’s event, there were reports many people at Amazon, including former CEO Jeff Bezos, weren’t sure whether it made sense to move forward with the device.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon plans to sell Astro in limited quantities later this year. While it will eventually cost $1,449.99, as part of its Day 1 Editions program, the company will sell the robot at an introductory price of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$999.99" href="https://amzn.to/3CSlVQp">$999.99</a>.

It promises personalized recipe discoveries and meal planning, including &quot;pre-curated&quot; menus for vegans, keto fans and others with specific dietary needs. Not surprisingly, you can add ingredients to your Alexa shopping list if you discover a recipe you like.</p><p>Halo Fitness will be available through the core Halo app later in 2021. You&#39;ll have to wait until January 2022 to try Halo Nutrition. You&#39;ll get a year&#39;s worth of the Halo subscription service if you buy a Halo View, so it won&#39;t cost much to try beyond purchasing the hardware. The question is whether or not you want to commit that deeply to Amazon&#39;s wearable vision.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon’s fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-nutrition-164816502.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">04bd1afa-50bf-45c6-b1a6-650f326cd3ed</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:48:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632851736</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T17:55:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/94a7b300-207a-11ec-bdfe-40328ac92345" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/94a7b300-207a-11ec-bdfe-40328ac92345" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Halo Fitness and Halo View activity tracker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Halo Fitness and Halo View activity tracker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon Glow is a kid-focused video call device with interactive activities]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s latest product is about creating more interactive video calling experiences for kids.

Glow also includes a physical privacy toggle that disables its included microphones and cameras.

The Amazon-owned security company has teamed up with Eero, the Amazon-owned networking firm, to incorporate the latter’s tech in the former’s hardware. With the Alarm Pro including an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-eero-6-mesh-wifi-router-173331388.html">Eero router inside</a>, the one module can now sit at the heart of your home’s internet and security system.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/92aa8150-1d36-11ec-ba7f-e1299e9a8917" alt="Ring Alarm Pro Hardware Image" data-uuid="90e291d5-3086-3662-a140-4e1e506daff3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ring</div></figure><p>In addition, Ring will now sell you additional battery packs which can be used to extend the working life of your Alarm system during power outages up to 24 hours. It’s worth saying that you can’t simply shove an Eero router next to your existing Ring Alarm product, however, since many of the new features take advantage of the integrations available to the Pro.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a51b9310-1d36-11ec-9efd-5890289565f9" alt="Image of the Ring Alarm Pro Battery Pack" data-uuid="9c325cf3-8359-3b86-912e-d570af923fc1"><figcaption>You will need to buy four packs to get your base station&#39;s battery life to 24 hours.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ring</div></figure><p>To take advantage of the technology, you’ll need to sign up to Ring’s new subscription product, dubbed Protect Pro. The package offers cloud video storage, professional monitoring, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18021383011">Alexa Guard Plus</a>, 24/7 backup internet for your security devices (via an LTE module in the Ring Pro base station) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-27-eero-secure-subscriptions-router.html">Eero’s cybersecurity subscription product</a> for network protection. This, at least in the US as it launches, will set you back $20 a month, or $200 per year per location up front.</p><p>Ring COO Mike Harris said that the decision to work with Eero was not one foisted down from upon high by Amazon. Instead, Harris said that both companies saw the opportunity to work together to help leverage their individual skills in tandem.</p><p>At the same time, Ring is launching a system dubbed “Virtual Security Guard,” which connects users to third-party security guards. You’ll need to pay for that separately, but you can hand over access to select Ring camera feeds to those companies who can keep a watch over your property. It is only when motion is detected that an operator can access your feed, and can speak to whoever is there to determine their intentions. Ring adds that third parties can’t view motion events when the camera is disarmed, and can’t download, share or save the clips of what’s going on in your front yard. The first company to sign up for the program is Rapid Response, with others expected to join in the near future.</p><p>Ring also offered up some good news for existing Ring doorbell owners, at least if you’re rocking the Pro 2 or the 2020-and-newer version of the standard bell. Those devices will soon be able to take advantage of smart alerts that will let you know if a package was delivered to a specially-designated zone on your doorstep. In addition, you can set up your Spotlight Cam Battery to identify an object left in a specific state, such as if you’ve left your garage door open. This should be useful, again, to avoid the curse of the “did I leave X unlocked” when you’re miles away from home.</p><p>The Ring Alarm Pro is available to pre-order today for $250, with the Protect Pro package costing you $20 a month. If you want to try Virtual Security Guard, meanwhile, you will need to contact the company and apply for early access</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon’s fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ring-eero-ring-alarm-pro-base-station-164341341.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">873c172b-31a8-4e75-8512-5d5c24440d41</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:43:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632847424</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T16:43:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7a90eb40-1d36-11ec-adfb-518b57857a18" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7a90eb40-1d36-11ec-adfb-518b57857a18" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ring]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Device family image of the Ring Alarm Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ring Alarm Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon made Disney a 'Hey, Disney!' voice assistant]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon and Disney have just announced a new voice assistant called &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hey, Disney!" href="https://amzn.to/3AUAHFS">Hey, Disney!</a>&quot; Built on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-adding-offline-voice-recognition-to-alexa-devices-171145961.html">Amazon&#39;s Alexa technology</a>, this new Disney assistant will be available on your home Echo as well as in Echo devices located in Walt Disney World Resort hotel rooms.

The company has announced that users will soon be able to sign up to join an invite-only testing program to help refine the hardware before it hits shelves. In the US, at least, Ring owners can sign up to help develop what its makers are calling a “very ambitious device.”</p><p>The Always Home Cam was initially announced back in September 2020 as part of a slew of new kit from Ring. It was designed to, when activated, automatically fly patrols around your home to keep watch over your property when you aren’t in. In addition, it may help assuage those universal fears about leaving your oven on, a window open or the back door unlocked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When it was launched, Ring sought to address the privacy concerns that some would-be users may have about the drone’s technology. For instance, the drone’s camera is obscured by its base station when it’s not in flight, and will issue an audible warning when it’s recording. The fortunate users who are allowed to sign up to try one of these out will be charged $250, but it&#39;s not clear if you&#39;ll get any sort of perk for the privilege of beta-testing the hardware.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon’s fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ring-always-home-cam-beta-test-invite-only-163911030.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a297bef5-1832-4783-88c4-3b51fad79cd1</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:39:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632847777</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T16:49:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5607dcb0-1f85-11ec-8968-8b9af9580b1a" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5607dcb0-1f85-11ec-8968-8b9af9580b1a" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ring]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of Ring's Always Home Cam]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ring Always Home Cam]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
