The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7-iv-camera-arrives-with-a-33-megapixel-sensor-and-4k-60p-video-141301936.html">A7 IV</a> brings a raft of new features and improvements like a higher-resolution 33-megapixel sensor, improved video specs and updated AI-powered autofocus. However, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:at $2,500" href="https://amzn.to/3K3Q7Nb">at $2,500</a> it‚Äôs also $500 more than the A7 III was at launch.</p><p>A lot has changed over the years between the two models. Sony now has to contend with formidable rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-r6-review-almost-perfect-140051632.html">Canon‚Äôs EOS R6</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z6-ii-z7-ii-4k-60p-video-faster-shooting-speeds-085022956.html">Nikon Z6 II</a>. It itself has also released new high-end models like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7s-iii-mirrorless-camera-review-140041536.html">A7S III</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-07-sony-a7r-iv-review.html">A7R IV</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">A1</a> loaded with the latest technology.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With all that, I was of course curious to see how the A7 IV would stack up in a category it dominated for quite a few years. How does it measure up against rivals, particularly when it comes to video? How much new tech from the high-end models has made it to the mainstream A7 IV? And is it suitable for professional use? Let‚Äôs dive in and find out.</p><h3>Design and handling</h3><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="870be3ee-d5ae-49b8-8ccd-06cffad58562"/><p>Sony‚Äôs A1, A7S III and A7R IV all had substantial body changes compared to their predecessors, and the A7 IV follows the same script. It has the same nice big grip, so you never feel you‚Äôre going to drop it, even  with a big lens. However, it has picked up some heft and size, weighing in at 699 grams compared to 650 with the AIII. It‚Äôs 7mm thicker, too.</p><p>It has similar controls to the A7 III, with the biggest difference being that the record button has moved from the back to an easier-to-access position on top. The buttons and dials also generally feel better and more precise, and the joystick is grippier and easier to use. It lacks certain dials compared to the far more expensive A1, like the shooting mode and autofocus dials. The lockable exposure compensation dial is the same, but lacks the graphics because it‚Äôs designed to be programmable.</p><p>In one way, however, the A7 IV‚Äôs body is a step up from the A1. The rear touch display can fully articulate and not just tilt out, so it‚Äôs much more practical for low-angle shooting in portrait orientation. That also makes it far more useful as a vlogging camera.</p><p>It has the same well-organized menu system as the A1 and A7S III, though some controls can be a bit tricky to find. As with any other modern camera then, it‚Äôs time well spent to set up the function menu, custom menus and manual controls to your liking. Overall, though, Sony‚Äôs menus are now among the best, and better organized than on Canon‚Äôs EOS R6, for example.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a1b265d0-73b9-11ec-adbb-6549fc25f05e" alt="Sony A7 IV full-frame mirrorless camera review" data-uuid="9e693075-6e47-3b5c-aee2-0cba5313aaf2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The 3.69-million dot EVF is much clearer than the 2.68-million dot one one on the A7 and on par with similarly priced rivals. However, the rear display is smaller and has lower resolution than the one on the R6. That can make manual focus tricky, though the A7 IV has a new feature that can help there ‚Äì more on that shortly.</p><p>The A7 IV has a dual-slot card system that supports both SD UHS II and much faster CFexpress Type A cards. However, unlike the slots on the A1 and A7S III, it only has a single dual-slot, with the other being SD UHS II only. Type A CFexpress cards aren‚Äôt quite as fast as regular CFexpress cards, topping out at 800 MB/s compared to 1,700 MB/s. They&#39;re also only used in Sony cameras, so they‚Äôre relatively hard to find and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ProGrade-Digital-CFexpressTM-Memory-160GB/dp/B09BYQCPR5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=3SCZC3HB57FJ5&amp;keywords=cfexpress+type+a&amp;qid=1642075420&amp;sprefix=cfexpress+type+%2Caps%2C181&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWjVLRjVEWDRWNkMmZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTAzNDM1MzIyNkQ1SUdNQzVTWTBWJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA3MTUwMzA3T0IwTVA4RjhaN0gmd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl">quite expensive</a>.</p><p>Other features include a USB-C port that can power the camera during operation, along with a full-sized HDMI port, thank God. It uses Sony‚Äôs new NP-FZ100 battery that delivers up to 580 shots on a charge, or about 2 hours of 4K video shooting. Finally, the A7 IV can close its mechanical shutter when the camera is turned off, protecting it from dust when you change lenses. That‚Äôs a feature that first appeared on the EOS R, so thanks for starting that trend, Canon.</p><h3>Performance</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a1e7f4c1-73b9-11ec-bf5a-70d7d639a3d8" alt="Sony A7 IV full-frame mirrorless camera review" data-uuid="1a9d3449-334c-3bbc-9ab0-e9be3dc6f5e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Sony‚Äôs mirrorless cameras are renowned for their autofocus speeds and AI smarts and the A7 IV is no exception. However, Sony made some compromises that affect performance.</p><p>The new 33-megapixel sensor is back-side illuminated but not stacked like the sensor on the A1, so readout speeds are relatively slow. As a result, shooting speeds are 10 fps like the A7 III  in either mechanical or electronic shutter modes for compressed RAW photos, and drop to 6 fps if you use lossless or uncompressed RAW, as many photographers prefer to do.</p><p>That‚Äôs still impressive considering the resolution is up nearly 50 percent. By comparison though, the Sony A1 can shoot 50-megapixel photos in electronic mode at up to 30 fps, showing the speed benefits of a stacked sensor.</p><p>While burst speeds aren‚Äôt improved, you can capture more photos at a time, up to 1,000 in the uncompressed RAW format. If you use CFexpress Type A cards from Sony or ProGrade, you can effectively shoot forever without filling the buffer.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/368734d0-73b8-11ec-bd76-35d70b1cd7e3" alt="Sony A7 IV full-frame mirrorless hybrid camera review sample images" data-uuid="73b7e6c8-1a81-3cad-a911-611633c94b04"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another drawback with the A7 IV‚Äôs slow sensor readout speeds is rolling shutter. If you want to shoot silently in electronic mode, you‚Äôll need to keep the camera steady and your subject can‚Äôt move quickly either. Otherwise, you‚Äôll see slanted lines and other artifacts that can be bad enough to ruin shots. Using the crop mode helps a lot, but then you lose the benefits of a full-frame sensor.</p><p>The A7 IV is Sony‚Äôs most advanced camera yet when it comes to autofocus. All of Sony‚Äôs new AI tricks add up to make it the easiest to use and most reliable camera I‚Äôve ever tested in that regard.</p><p>Unlike the A7 III, face, eye and body tracking works in all focus modes for animals, birds and people. Unless you turn it off, it‚Äôll automatically pick up your subject‚Äôs eyes, face or body and track them even if they turn or disappear from frame.</p><p>Whether you‚Äôre tracking sports, birds or cars, the tracking spot will stay tenaciously locked to your subject in most situations. All you have to do is touch the subject you want to track and the camera will take it from there.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a1e8b810-73b9-11ec-b9bf-af0a96123df9" alt="Sony A7 IV full-frame mirrorless camera review" data-uuid="bf980e0d-a2c1-3a9b-b8b5-b155a83247fc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The A7 IV‚Äôs autofocus can easily keep up with the camera‚Äôs burst speeds for sports or bird shooting. But more importantly, the A7 IV consistently nails focus in other tricky situations, particularly with people. In some chaotic situations with lots of subjects and complex lighting, I ended up with very few unusable shots. Keep in mind that optimum focus performance requires Sony‚Äôs latest lenses, but it worked well with recent Sigma models as well.</p><p>Focus is just one part of the equation. It consistently nailed auto-exposure and auto white balance in tricky situations with a mix of lighting. That worked well in a bar with a mix of studio and practical lights, or in front of the famous Paris department store animated windows with all kinds of colors of lights.</p><p>In-body stabilization improves a half stop over the A7 III to 5.5 stops with compatible lenses, but neither comes close to Canon‚Äôs claimed 8 stops on the EOS R6. That‚Äôs somewhat balanced out by Sony‚Äôs superior high ISO performance, however. I was still able to get reasonably sharp shots down to a half second with some care.</p><h3>Photo Quality</h3><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="b785efff-feb8-43b2-93ec-e873eea3a17d"/><p>A big improvement with the A7 IV is with image quality. You‚Äôd expect more sharpness with the extra resolution, and it certainly delivers that. However, you might also think that  the smaller pixels would make A7 IV worse in low light, but nope. In fact, through much of its ISO range, the A7 IV performs better even than Sony‚Äôs low-light champ, the A7S III.</p><p>Images are clean and usable in most low-light situations right up to ISO 12,800, with plenty of detail even in underexposed shots. In fact, the A7 IV has the least noise I‚Äôve ever seen in that ISO range. Correctly exposed photos are usable up to ISO 25,600, but noise becomes a serious issue after that.</p><p>Sony has improved its color science with every new camera lately, and the A7 IV has perhaps its best setup yet. The green cast we‚Äôve seen on earlier models is gone and colors are accurate right out of the camera and easier to balance in post than ever before.</p><p>JPEGs look great straight out of the camera with a nice balance between detail and noise reduction. The 14-bit RAW images deliver up to 13 stops of dynamic range, giving you plenty of room to lift shadows and claw back highlights. Overall, Sony‚Äôs A7 IV delivers perhaps the best images of any of its cameras, with a great balance between detail, high ISO performance and color accuracy.</p><section data-eng-breakout="cebdd531d31e4539893168d447f45b2d" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3661ab70-73b8-11ec-aac0-3ef850975af9" alt="Sony A7 IV full-frame mirrorless hybrid camera review sample images"></section><div class="inline-emphasis"><p>As a semi-pro hybrid camera, the A7 IV is aimed at enthusiasts but could easily serve as a second body for professional shooters who use Sony gear. To that end, I‚Äôve enlisted the services of Samuel Dejours and Nathanael Charpentiers from <a href="https://studio-nathsam.com/">Studio Nathsam</a> in Gien, France, who do weddings, births, events and studio work.</p><p><em>How is the handling on the a7 III from a pro standpoint?</em></p><p>Samuel: First of all the handling is a lot better than the A7 III. What I liked a lot, which is a big change for Sony, is the fully articulating display. It‚Äôs especially useful in portrait mode when you‚Äôre shooting from ground level below the subject.</p><p><em>What are the strong and weak points for events and studio use?</em></p><p>Nat: In terms of the color accuracy, it‚Äôs really improved a lot, it‚Äôs great now.</p><p>Samuel: A big issue for us is that the rolling shutter is pretty pronounced, which is a shame because it limits the use of the camera in silent mode for weddings and events.</p><p>Nathanael: And if you use this camera it‚Äôs really required for certain things because the mechanical shutter is particularly loud.</p><p><em>Could this serve as a professional camera for you?</em></p><p>Yes, it could serve as a professional camera because it‚Äôs really versatile in terms of doing both photos and video. It lacks features available on the A1 and A9, but that‚Äôs normal because those cameras are in a completely different price category.</p></div><h3>Video</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7f186a10-7468-11ec-b37b-1620db9900b5" alt="Sony A7 IV review" data-uuid="7fc16c78-ff14-3003-b96e-58be179daac2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samuel Dejours</div></figure><p>Finally we‚Äôre onto video, the one area where rival cameras have moved well beyond the A7 III. Fortunately the A7 IV has big improvements in that area too, along with one drawback.</p><p>As before, it can shoot downsampled 4K video at up to 30p using the full width of the sensor, meaning video is extremely sharp. But now, it can capture that video at 4:2:2 10-bit with Sony‚Äôs S-Log, so it‚Äôs much easier to stretch and pull in post-production.</p><p>And now you can shoot 4K at up to 60 fps, also with 10 bits of color depth. While it‚Äôs cropped, video is still downsampled from a 4.6K size, so it remains sharp. The A7 IV can‚Äôt handle 120 fps 4K like Canon‚Äôs EOS R6, but then again it doesn‚Äôt have the R6‚Äôs serious overheating issues either. If you need that frame rate, it‚Äôs only available up to 1080p. HDMI output is limited to 4K 25p at just 8 bits of color depth, unfortunately.</p><p>With 13 stops of dynamic range in Sony‚Äôs S-Log3 mode, along with 10-bit 4:2:2 color and reasonably high bit rates up to 500 Mbps, image quality is superb and easy to control in post. The lack of noise at high ISO ranges is a huge plus, making the camera usable in a lot of low and tricky lighting situations.</p><p>Eye AF and tracking now work in video mode, making it far more dependable for shooting interviews or action. As with photos, it‚Äôs extremely intuitive to use. You can tap a subject to track it, and it will automatically switch to eye or face tracking as needed.</p><section data-eng-breakout="065a5e371256451cad9fe72d0f3e4ebc" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/115b0000-7468-11ec-bafb-8bb1a42f70ba" alt="Sony A7 IV review"></section><p>There‚Äôs a new and cool video feature called lens breathing compensation. Normally, pulling focus from one subject to another causes a slight but distracting zoom ‚Äì an issue that‚Äôs particularly problematic on Sony‚Äôs pricey GM lenses, as good as they are. The breathing compensation function introduces a slight digital zoom that counteracts any change in focal length when focusing on a new subject.</p><p>Using the feature does cause a slight crop, and it only works with select, mostly expensive, Sony lenses. It‚Äôs a really nice feature though, and currently only found on the A7 IV.</p><p>Sony has made manual focusing for video easier as well with Manual Focus Assist. It places blue and red colors over objects behind and in front of the focus plane, while objects in focus are clear. Once I got used to it, it was relatively easy to pull focus quickly and in the right direction. The color display is a bit blocky, though, so super precise adjustments can be a challenge.</p><p>Image stabilization is very effective for video, particularly with active mode engaged. It works with 4K in both cropped 60p and uncropped 30p modes. However, rolling shutter can be pretty brutal in 30p mode with the full width of the sensor, and stabilization can sometimes make that worse (and unfixable). If you have a wide lens and can stick to the cropped mode with active stabilization, wobble is well controlled and not much worse than with the excellent A1.</p><h3>Wrap-up</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b1ad05d0-7468-11ec-bfff-138b53d98510" alt="Sony A7 IV review" data-uuid="8a3918c7-2c9c-3275-bcfe-16840f9c2cfc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The A7 IV offers big improvements in resolution, AF tracking, video features and more, but forget about the spec sheet for a second. Sony‚Äôs largest achievement is that it created a mainstream camera that makes photography and video easier, thanks to AI smarts that can aid any photographer, no matter their skill.</p><p>The biggest drawback is rolling shutter that might give you pause if you require a silent mode or want to shoot uncropped 4K video. Another issue is the $2,500 price that‚Äôs $500 more than the A7 III was at launch.</p><p>Other hybrid cameras in that price range can‚Äôt quite measure up, though. Canon‚Äôs $2,500 20-megapixel EOS R6 is your best alternative, but the resolution is a big step down. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-s5-full-frame-mirrorless-review-140006301.html">Panasonic‚Äôs 24-megapixel S5</a> and Nikon‚Äôs Z6 II are other decent options, but lack the reliability and ease of use of the A7 IV.

While the game isn&#39;t expected to return to either store anytime soon, it seems players will soon be able to drop on the island once again on their phones and tablets (unless they already use a sideloaded version on Android or play console versions remotely).</p><p>NVIDIA and Epic Games have teamed up on a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2022/01/13/geforce-now-fortnite-closed-beta/">mobile version of the battle royale</a> that&#39;s playable through GeForce Now. A desktop version is already available on the service.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A limited-time closed beta will get underway next week to test server capacity, graphics delivery and touch controls.

If you&#39;re able to secure a spot, you&#39;ll be able to play <em>Fortnite </em>through Safari on iOS and the GeForce Now app on Android. NVIDIA and Epic haven&#39;t set an end date for the beta as yet.&nbsp;</p><p>When NVIDIA enabled GeForce Now on iOS via the web <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-safari-fortnite-beta-launch-140052998.html">in November 2020</a>, it said it would eventually give iPhone and iPad users access to <em>Fortnite </em>again, though it and Epic were building a touch-friendly version first.

The only real difference is that instead of ordering food from local restaurants, Instacart is hoping its customers will use Ready Meals to order fresh food like sandwiches, sushi and more from nearby grocery stores, in addition to pre-prepared, ready-to-heat dishes such as take-and-bake casseroles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Just like regular grocery orders, Instacart says its Ready Meals Hub will be available nationwide, with deliveries arriving at your door in as little as 30 minutes. Instacart is partnering with grocers including Publix, GIANT, Food Lion, Hannaford, Stop &amp; Shop, Martin‚Äôs, and Kroger, with plans to add more retailers such as ShopRite in the coming months.</p><p>The arrival of the Ready Meals Hub in the Instacart app follows the addition of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kroger-delivery-now-instacart-141006383.html">Convenience Hub last fall</a>, which added the ability to order a range of pantry staples, snacks, and even alcohol from big-name stores like 7-Eleven and others. Another benefit of the new Ready Meals Hub is that because pre-prepared foods can be ordered alongside regular groceries, Instacart is making it easier to order food for a variety of meals or situations with a single purchase.</p><p>The expansion of Instacart&#39;s delivery options serves to further reinforce the increasing popularity of home grocery delivery. According to a recent <a href="https://www.theshelbyreport.com/2021/07/28/fmi-releases-2021-power-of-foodservice-at-retail-study/">report from the Food Industry Association (FMI)</a>, while most meals in the U.S. are still prepared at home, 55% percent of shoppers noted a desire for more hybrid meal options that contain a mix of semi-prepared and fully-prepared dishes.</p><p>That said, with <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-ipos-to-expect-in-2022-reddit-instacart-and-others-could-hit-wall-street-11640116396">Instacart expected to go public later this year</a>, the new Ready Meals Hub is also clearly a way to help maintain strong sales following a record number of orders during the 2021 holiday season.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instacart-announces-ready-meals-hot-food-delivery-service-160012846.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a833e129-3ef1-4f99-b670-0d93e44f0bf6</guid><dc:creator>Sam Rutherford</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 16:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642086881</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T15:14:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Sam Rutherford]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0f7b10e0-7472-11ec-b477-6a412fc26151" width="2091" height="1043" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0f7b10e0-7472-11ec-b477-6a412fc26151" width="2091" height="1043" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instacart]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instacart Ready Meals Hub]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instacart Ready Meals]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG is bringing its CLOi service robot to the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t be shocked if a robot serves you the next time you eat out or go on vacation.

While Sony plans to keep manufacturing the PlayStation 4 for the time being to make up for its shortfall of current-gen consoles, the Xbox One is no more.</p><p>We <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-one-x-one-x-discontinued-182312615.html">learned in July 2020</a> that Microsoft had discontinued the Xbox One X and Xbox One S Digital Edition by that point. Now, it has emerged the company quietly stopped making the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-02-xbox-one-s-review.html">Xbox One S</a> by the end of that year too. ‚ÄúTo focus on production of Xbox Series X/S, we stopped production for all Xbox One consoles by the end of 2020,‚Äù Xbox‚Äôs senior director of console product marketing Cindy Walker told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22881211/microsoft-discontinues-xbox-one-consoles-2020"><em>The Verge</em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It seems the strategy has paid off. Xbox head Phil Spencer told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-phil-spencer.html?showTranscript=1"><em>The New York Times</em></a> this week that Microsoft has sold more of the Series X and Series S at this point in their lifecycle than it has with any previous Xbox generation, though he didn‚Äôt reveal actual sales figures. Analyst Daniel Ahmad of Niko Partners <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1480856801688047617">said</a> that would put shipments of Series X/S at more than 12 million units.</p><p>While the more powerful Series X typically sells out minutes after every stock drop (it doesn‚Äôt help that scalpers are using bots to snap them up), the Series S isn‚Äôt hard to come by at this point. It‚Äôs available to buy at the time of writing in the US, UK and Canada at retailers like <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xbox-RRS-00007-Series-S/dp/B08GD9MNZB">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/microsoft-xbox-series-s-512-gb-all-digital-console-disc-free-gaming-white/6430277.p?skuId=6430277">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/xbox-series-x%7Cs/consoles/products/microsoft-xbox-series-s-digital-edition/224746.html">GameStop</a> and <a href="https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/xbox-series-s/6000201790919">Walmart</a>. Given that the Series S can handle pretty much everything the Xbox One can ‚Äî except for playing discs ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt make a ton of sense for Microsoft to keep making that console.</p><p>It‚Äôs a slightly different story for Sony. Save for the disc drive, there‚Äôs no difference between the two PS5 models. Given the high demand (Sony had sold <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-134-million-ps5s-084114658.html">13.4 million units by October 2021</a>) and the ongoing supply chain crisis, it‚Äôs harder for most people to score one of those consoles than a Series S right now. As such, Sony told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-12/sony-tackles-playstation-5-shortage-by-making-more-ps4-consoles"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> on Wednesday it will keep making the PS4 (which uses less advanced components than the PS5) in 2022, despite reportedly planning to discontinue the console last year. The company&#39;s said to be making around a million PS4 units in this year.</p><p>Sony previously suggested it would support PS4 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/09/16/ps5-retail-units/">through 2024</a>. Several of its first-party exclusives are coming to both the current- and previous-gen consoles this year, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-sony-playstation-4-215249430.html"><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gran-turismo-7-ps5-release-date-205422758.html"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-first-footage-205908760.html"><em>God of War Ragnar√∂k</em></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-one-discontinued-152122153.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c6d1f2a6-a443-4d65-9bc6-73c164ed1539</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:21:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642087286</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T15:21:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3400fae0-7483-11ec-addf-53269487b972" width="1920" height="1245" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3400fae0-7483-11ec-addf-53269487b972" width="1920" height="1245" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Xbox One S and Xbox Controller.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Xbox One S]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Comcast tests the first multigigabit cable modem]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press">Comcast</a> is now considerably closer to making <a href="https://www.engadget.com/comcast-10g-test-141741439.html">multigigabit cable internet</a> a reality. The company has successfully tested the first 10G modem capable of multigigabit speeds. The Broadcom-built prototype used the full duplex DOCSIS 4.0 standard to provide download and upload bandwidth topping 4Gbps.

The company previously reached those speeds using a virtualized system, and in October 2020 was &#39;only&#39; managing 1.25Gbps with the new DOCSIS technology.

While it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Comcast raised or even waived caps for multigigabit users, it might be difficult to take advantage of the larger data pipe if any caps discourage sustained use.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/comcast-10gbps-multigigabit-cable-modem-test-150001003.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d3277c2f-9017-4152-b2bc-cda2f98486d6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 15:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642083300</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T14:15:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/043ad280-5eb8-11ec-b3af-a2728a244a46" width="5000" height="3750" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/043ad280-5eb8-11ec-b3af-a2728a244a46" width="5000" height="3750" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Smith Collection/Gado via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Comcast Xfinity truck parked on road in suburban neighborhood, San Ramon, California, October 14, 2020.

The $150 buds pack a lot of premium features into a relatively affordable price point, making them a good option for those with tight budgets. The Buds 2 are an even better buy when you can get them on sale for $100, which is what Woot has them for right now. That&#39;s $50 off the normal rate and a return to a record low ‚Äî but before you take the plunge, remember to check out <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Woot&#39;s return policy" href="https://fave.co/3hQFqju">Woot&#39;s return policy</a> since it does differ significantly from that of its parent company, Amazon.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/31PqXAh" id="1e32c17e6c7e4320ae6a418bc50c0559" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Woot;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Buds 2 at Woot - $100</a><p>Samsung made its smallest and most comfortable earbuds yet with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html#batterylife">Galaxy Buds 2</a>. They&#39;re 15 percent smaller and 20 percent lighter than the Galaxy Buds+, which were already pretty comfy to begin with. You&#39;ll get roughly five hours of use from the buds before they need more juice, which isn&#39;t a battery life to write home about but it is on par with many competitors. The earbuds&#39; case holds an additional three full charges and it supports wireless charging as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>ANC and the adjustable ambient sound mode are two of the buds&#39; biggest selling points. Samsung brought those features down from its higher-end earbuds and, while the ANC isn&#39;t as strong as what you&#39;ll find on something like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-review-163027027.html">Galaxy Buds Pro</a>, it still does a good job of blocking out environmental noises. That five-hour battery life mentioned above is with ANC turned on too, so you won&#39;t have to sacrifice in that respect when you want a couple of solid hours with fewer distractions.</p><p>All of those features make a pair of wireless earbuds that provide a lot of value to Android users at a decent price. Make no mistake, the Galaxy Buds 2 are best when paired with an Android device ‚Äî while it&#39;s possible to use them with an iPhone, you&#39;ll be stuck with the default settings.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-buds-2-are-back-on-sale-for-100-143041841.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f2aea70-f2ae-4abc-aef1-21acd77a9ffb</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 14:30:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642082106</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T13:55:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/efd486d0-faa6-11eb-b94f-10d8b46c6c7b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/efd486d0-faa6-11eb-b94f-10d8b46c6c7b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 revivew]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 revivew]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arturia unveils 'Noir' editions of its popular MiniBrute synths]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-analog-lab-v-accessibility-mode-story-music-software-lack-assistive-160013048.html">Arturia</a> has launched <a href="https://www.arturia.com/brute-noir-editions">Brute Noir editions</a> of its popular mid-tier monophonic synths, the <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/hardware-synths/minibrute-2/overview">MiniBrute 2</a> and MiniBrute 2S.

Most recently, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/leica-m10r-rangefinder-40-megapixel-130035234.html">the M10-R added a 40-megapixel sensor</a> to the to the camera, a big step up over the 24-megapixel one found in the original M10. But today, Leica is ready to leave the M10 lineup behind and move to a totally new camera, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Leica M11" href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/x9mzNO">Leica M11</a>.</p><p>Well, ‚Äútotally new‚Äù might be a stretch. It‚Äôll look familiar to anyone who has seen Leica‚Äôs famous lineup of rangefinder cameras before, and it still uses Leica‚Äôs M mount for lenses, but the company has put in enough new features to justify giving it a new name. First and foremost is a new 60-megapixel full-frame sensor, making this camera a huge upgrade for anyone who might have purchased the original M10 back in 2017. The so-called ‚Äútriple resolution‚Äù sensor can shoot at either 60, 36 or 18 megapixels in DNG RAW or JPG. Notably, Leica says it&#39;ll shoot using the full sensor area when shooting at a lower resolution, rather than cropping the image down. But these images might loose some sharpness because of pixel binning or line skipping that occurs when using the full sensor to shoot at a lower resolution. .</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Shooting at lower resolution, though, will naturally save storage space and also offer extended burst shooting. The ISO on this camera ranges from 64 all the way to 50,000, a stop more than the 100-50,000 range offered on the M10 series.  The ISO on this camera goes from 64 all the way to 50,000, a stop more than the 100-50,000 range offered on the M10 series.</p><p>Speaking of storage, the M11 has 64GB of onboard storage, which lets photographers storage images both on the internal memory as well as an SD memory card. Leica also redesigned the bottom plate of the camera to provide quicker access to the SD cart slot and battery. There‚Äôs also a USB-C port right in the bottom of the camera, which makes charging the battery and transferring pictures to a computer a bit easier. That‚Äôs a fairly common feature these days, but it‚Äôs still a welcome addition to the M11. Leica also says that the M11‚Äôs 1,800mAh battery stores 64 percent more power than the battery on older models</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/bb10aab0-73d6-11ec-96fd-d0711cf75dba" alt="Leica M11 transferring photos to a smartphone." data-uuid="0572b8ac-7ab1-33e2-963d-94a014dc578b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Leica</div></figure><p>As with the M10 series, the M11 uses Leica‚Äôs optical rangefinder and manual focus only. But the 3-inch back screen, which you can also use as a viewfinder, has 2,332,800 pixels, more than double the 1,036,800 pixels on the M10. In another concession to modern technology, the M11 has both a mechanical and an electronic shutter.&nbsp;</p><p>The standard mechanical option can shoot at speeds up to 1/4000th of a second, while the electronic shutter goes up to a whopping 1/16,000 of a second. Perhaps most significantly, the electronic shutter will be totally silent, something that street photographers should appreciate. The M10-R had an ‚Äúextra silent‚Äù mechanical shutter, but you can‚Äôt beat a motionless electronic shutter if you need perfectly quiet operation.</p><p>Leica is offering two models: an all-black M11 and a black and silver option. The latter uses a brass top plate and as such weighs in at 640 grams, 100 grams more than the all-black models. To save weight, that camera has an aluminum top with a scratch-resistant coating. Regardless of which finish you prefer, the M11 is wildly expensive, in keeping with Leica tradition. It costs <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:$8,995" href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/x9mzNO">$8,995</a> without a lens, the same price as the M10-R.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the numerous improvements here, it‚Äôs nice that Leica didn‚Äôt increase the price further, but ‚Äî as we said when we checked out the M10-R ‚Äî Leica rangefinders are as much a status symbol as they are a photography tool. We said the M10-R was the king of that category in 2020, but now it seems the M11 has taken the throne. The M11 is available to order now.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/leica-m11-rangefinder-digital-camera-price-specs-release-date-140032032.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93c1f35a-08ef-42e3-98a2-abacb2b687f0</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 14:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642086182</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T15:03:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4dcb3d40-747a-11ec-b712-3e259b345865" width="2817" height="1726" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4dcb3d40-747a-11ec-b712-3e259b345865" width="2817" height="1726" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Leica]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The M11 rangefinder digital camera.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Leica M11 rangefinder digital camera]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's updated iCloud Private Relay notice clarifies why it might not work for some users]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is set to slightly alter the wording on its notice for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/applenot-release-private-relay-china-090524919.html">iCloud Private Relay</a> error that switched off the VPN-like feature for some users. According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/icloud-private-relay-clarification-ios-15-3/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, the tech giant will update its note for users, clarifying that their carriers aren&#39;t <em>always</em> to blame for the issue. After a previous iOS 15.2 update, some users found that they couldn&#39;t use Private Relay while on a cellular network. Private Relay ensures that, as long as the user is on Safari, not even Apple can see their activities.&nbsp;</p><p>The original notice puts the blame solely on mobile carriers:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan.

It told <em>Bloomberg&#39;s</em> Mark Gurman in a <a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1480987702363189248">statement</a> that it identified a problem with the iOS 15.2 update that toggled off the feature by default. Apple <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/apple-icloud-private-relay-ios-15-2/?Bibblio_source=true">denied</a> that its update rolled out with changes to Private Relay, as one would expect: &quot;No changes were made to iCloud Private Relay in iOS 15.2 that would have toggled the feature off,&quot; a spokesperson said.</p><p>Whatever the real reason is for the feature being switched off, fixing the problem could be as simple as toggling some settings back on. The updated notice that rolled out with iOS 15.3 beta now says:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan. Private Relay is either not supported by your cellular plan or has been turned off in Cellular Settings.

The new entry-level <a href="https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-rev1/black/overview/#utm_source=PR_EN&amp;utm_medium=in-feed-link&amp;utm_campaign=DDJ-REV1-Promotion-20220113&amp;utm_id=ATC">DDJ-REV1</a> ($259) and the pro-level <a href="https://www.pioneerdj.com/en-us/product/controller/ddj-rev7/black/overview/#utm_source=PR_EN-US&amp;utm_medium=in-feed-link&amp;utm_campaign=DDJ-REV7-Promotion-20220113&amp;utm_id=ATC">DDJ-REV7</a> ($1,899) are both Serato DJ compatible and offer an adjusted layout for fans of the sideways turntable and the Pioneer DJM-S series of mixers.</p><p>Newcomers interested in this style of DJing can get a taste of what‚Äôs to come, with a few useful flourishes for the livestreaming generation. The 2-channel DDJ-REV1 controller runs Serato DJ Lite and includes a 14-day trial of Serato DJ Pro. It‚Äôs bus-powered and has slightly larger jog wheels than prior models in this price range. It also includes a mic input that blends into the master so you can get chatty during livestreams without extra gear - a perk in this level of product. Along with the mic, the only other input is the USB port, and you only get a single RCA master output.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although pint-sized, the layout echoes a classic battle DJ‚Äôs choice with platters at the bottom and a horizontal pitch slider up top. A sideways turntable allowed easier scratching without the tonearm getting in the way, which resulted in an unusual placement for the pitch control. It seems that some have gotten used to it and this type of controller layout caters to that familiarity.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c5a1a040-7329-11ec-bf9e-13ce4142c2c8" alt="Pioneer DJ / Serato DJ - DDJ-REV1 controller" data-uuid="2917ed12-5120-36ea-9be7-58a964cea0c8"><figcaption>The DDJ-REV1 controller.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pioneer DJ</div></figure><p>The central mixing panel also borrows from the popular Pioneer DJM-S series, with performance pads in the middle and lockable FX toggles. There‚Äôs a Scratch Bank to store your choice of audio clips and also a Tracking Scratch feature. This saves you having to get back to a scratchable cue point by doing it for you when you remove your hands from the ridged capacitive jog wheel or spin it back.</p><p>If you have more seasoned skills and/or more money to spend, the 2-channel DDJ-REV7 is a better fit. This higher-end model includes 7-inch motorized jog wheels with vinyl-mimicking top plates and adjustable torque for a classic turntable feel. Each side also includes a 3.5-inch on-jog display where you can see waveforms and other data, or switch to a Serato virtual deck view, song artwork or your own logo with easy-to-see omnidirectional viewing.</p><p>As with the economy model, the DDJ-REV7 mimics a classic cut and scratch layout with the DJM-S styled central mixer, performance pads and FX toggle. Those jog wheels are along the front edge with the pitch slider on the top. Relevant control buttons live in between those, somewhat reminiscent of the Pioneer CDJ series layout.</p><p>Other highlights for the DDJ-REV7 are onboard scratch samples, a Maglev Fader Pro and 22 built-in Beat FX. If you want to flank your controller with turntables or CDJs, you‚Äôre in luck since there are line and phono inputs on each channel. Plan to swap with another DJ during live sets? The dual USB ports will make life easier. You&#39;ll need a computer for most things, since there&#39;s no thumb drive or SD Card slot. It <em>seems</em> you can store full tracks in the on-board scratch bank along with clips, but that doesn&#39;t seem like a complete solution. For outputs you&#39;ll get XLR and RCA ports for master out, plus balanced 1/4-inch TRS for the booth.</p><p>The entry-level <a href="https://www.pioneerdj.com/en/product/controller/ddj-rev1/black/overview/#utm_source=PR_EN&amp;utm_medium=in-feed-link&amp;utm_campaign=DDJ-REV1-Promotion-20220113&amp;utm_id=ATC">DDJ-REV1</a> is expected to be available in late January at the retail price of $259 and works with the free Serato DJ Lite (<a href="https://serato.com/dj/lite/downloads">1.5.9</a>) software, although the pro version will also work.

While its final approval hearing won&#39;t take place until July, the tech giant has <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/apple-bag-check-lawsuit-settlement/?utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds">detailed</a> the terms of the $29.9 million settlement <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-offers-30-million-to-settle-off-the-clock-bag-search-controversy-084819770.html">it agreed to</a> and provided claimants (and everyone else) access to documents related to the case on its <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/more-resources/settlement/apple-bag-check-settlement.html">legal website</a>. The list of documents includes everything from the original class action complaint to notices of the settlement to different types of class members. It also includes information on how to get in contact with the settlement administrator.</p><p>A group Apple employees sued the company in 2013 for not paying them for the time it took to check their bags during their shifts or when they&#39;re leaving for work, which took between five to 20 minutes. They claimed Apple was violating California law by doing so. Apple said bag checks were necessary to ensure workers weren&#39;t leaving with stolen goods or trade secrets and tried to argue in court that those who didn&#39;t like the policy could simply not bring their bags or their iPhones to work. The company stopped searching employees&#39; bags in 2015.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While a district court originally tossed the lawsuit, it went to the California Supreme Court on appeal, wherein the judge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-apple-pay-employees-bag-searches-lost-time.html">sided</a> with the plaintiffs. As previously <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-13/apple-to-pay-30-million-over-security-checks-for-store-workers?sref=10lNAhZ9">revealed</a> in a court filing, the lawsuit covers 14,683 workers in 52 Apple Stores in California who were subjected to bag checks from July 25th, 2009 until August 10th, 2015. They&#39;ll each get $1,286 from the settlement amount.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-details-settlement-off-the-clock-bag-search-lawsuit-071600545.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ffac6ca-219a-4fea-a2a4-6f27a73587d8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 07:16:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642058160</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T08:58:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/6e46d850-7438-11ec-bbf9-a1cfe5b6963f" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/6e46d850-7438-11ec-bbf9-a1cfe5b6963f" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Noah Sauve via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Glendale, California - July 16, 2021: The Apple store at the Americana at Brand outdoor shopping center]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The Apple Store at the Americana at Brand in Glendale, California]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch will launch an improved reporting and appeals process in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following a year that saw it struggle to shield its users from abuse and harassment, Twitch has <a href="https://safety.twitch.tv/s/safety-news/detail?language=en_US&amp;post=An-Open-Letter-from-Our-Head-of-Trust-and-Safety"><ins>published a retrospective</ins></a> of its 2021 safety efforts that includes a look forward to how the company plans to tackle the issue in 2022. Specifically, Angela Hession, Twitch‚Äôs vice president of global trust and safety, says the company will update its user reporting and appeals process.&nbsp;</p><p>It also plans to upgrade its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-suspicious-user-detection-announcement-000510859.html"><ins>Suspicious User Detection</ins></a> feature. The AI tool, which the company launched at the end of last year, automatically flags individuals it believes may be repeat ban dodgers. In 2022, Twitch has updates planned around how streamers can use information from that tool. As the company has indicated previously, it also plans to update its sexual content policy to clarify various aspects of it. Twitch simultaneously intends to share more and ‚Äúbetter‚Äù educational content across its safety center and other areas.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitch spent much of the latter half of 2021 trying to stop automated &quot;hate raid&quot; harassment campaigns. The attacks saw malicious individuals use thousands of bots to spam channels with hateful language, and they frequently targeted streamers from marginalized communities. In September, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-sues-hate-raiders-cruzzcontrol-and-creatine-overdose-184439305.html">sued</a> CruzzControl and CreatineOverdose, two of the more prolific individuals involved in those campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We‚Äôll likely never be able to eliminate [hate raids] entirely,&quot; Hession said. However, she claims Twitch  &quot;significantly&quot; cut down on the number of bots on its platform through some of its actions in 2021. In 2022, it looks to continue that work through the improvements it announced today.&nbsp;</p><p>If the company‚Äôs safety roadmap feels light on details, Hession says that‚Äôs out of necessity. ‚ÄúThe honest and unfortunate reality is that we can&#39;t always be specific because bad actors can and have used that transparency to attempt to thwart our efforts,‚Äù she said.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, the executive acknowledged Twitch needs to do a better job of communicating what it‚Äôs doing to make people feel safe on its platform. It‚Äôs easy to see why the company would say that. When it felt like the hate raids that were occurring on Twitch couldn‚Äôt get any worse, many creators banded together to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamers-are-taking-a-day-off-next-week-to-protest-hate-raids-065515266.html"><ins>protest</ins></a> the lack of action they saw from the company.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-2022-safety-plans-232940991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bd42848-2e68-4375-90d4-d4a228426c85</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 23:29:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642030259</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T08:59:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e77c3c50-0b2f-11ec-963f-12463c6b2860" width="3500" height="2333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e77c3c50-0b2f-11ec-963f-12463c6b2860" width="3500" height="2333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A man works at a computer at the offices of Twitch Interactive Inc, a social video platform and gaming community owned by Amazon, in San Francisco, California, U.S., March 6, 2017.

A group of 270 doctors, nurses, scientists and educators <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/covid-misinformation-joe-rogan-spotify-petition-1282240/">have sent an open letter to Spotify</a> following a recent episode of <em>The</em><em>Joe Rogan Experience</em>, calling for the streaming service to adopt a clear policy and to fulfill its &quot;responsibility to mitigate the spread of misinformation.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>On the December 31st episode of his podcast, Joe Rogan interviewed Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who says he&#39;s one of the creators of mRNA technology. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/08/robert-malone-vaccine-inventor-vaccine-skeptic/619734/">unclear</a> whether that&#39;s true. During the chat, Malone made baseless claims about COVID-19, including the idea that &quot;mass formation psychosis&quot; led people to believe the vaccines were effective and the notion that President Biden had withheld data that supported ivermectin as a valid treatment. The episode quickly went viral among both critics and fans as Rogan averages over 10 million listeners per episode. YouTube <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/joe-rogan-podcast-youtube-robert-malone-b1986008.html">removed a video of the interview</a> and Malone was recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2021/12/31/prominant-virologist-kicked-off-twitter-for-spreading-anti-vaxx-video-15844655/">banned from Twitter</a> for violations of the platform&#39;s COVID-19 misinformation policy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;By allowing the propagation of false and societally harmful assertions, Spotify is enabling its hosted media to damage public trust in scientific research and sow doubt in the credibility of data-driven guidance offered by medical professionals,&quot; <a href="https://spotifyopenletter.wordpress.com/2022/01/10/an-open-letter-to-spotify/">the letter explains</a>. &quot;[The episode] is not the only transgression to occur on the Spotify platform, but a relevant example of the platform‚Äôs failure to mitigate the damage it is causing.&quot;</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406315/joe-rogan-vaccine-spotify-podcast-covid-19"><em>The Verge reported</em></a> that Spotify was okay with a Rogan episode on which he encouraged 21-year-olds to not get vaccinated. A company source indicated the message wasn&#39;t &quot;outwardly anti-vaccine&quot; and he didn&#39;t &quot;make a call to action,&quot; <em>The Verge&#39;s </em>Ashley Carman wrote at the time. Spotify has taken down more explicit examples of vaccine misinformation, including <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ian-brown-says-spotify-have-taken-down-his-anti-lockdown-song-little-seed-big-tree-2899613">a song from musician Ian Brown</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/pete-evans-spotify-ban-2021-1">a podcast from Pete Evans</a>. The company has said in the past that it &quot;prohibits content on the platform which promotes dangerous false, deceptive, or misleading content about COVID-19 that may cause offline harm and/or pose a direct threat to public health.&quot; And that when something violates those guidelines, it is removed.</p><p>However, as this open letter points out, Spotify doesn&#39;t have an official misinformation policy like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and others. The group is asking for the platform to do just that, rather than to directly take action against Rogan or remove the episode in question.

We recently highlighted the Wyze Cam V3 as our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html"><ins>favorite overall home security camera</ins></a>, thanks to its low price and handy selection of features. Although a subscription isn&#39;t totally necessary for the company&#39;s cameras, it does offer extra utility. With that in mind, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wyze/"><ins>Wyze</ins></a> is opening up a new subscription tier to everyone.</p><p>The <a href="https://forums.wyzecam.com/t/we-re-giving-wyze-person-detection-to-all-users-at-whatever-price-you-want-1-11-22/211282"><ins>Cam Plus Lite plan</ins></a> includes AI-powered Person Detection (instead of motion detection) and 12-second event recordings. Here&#39;s the twist: it&#39;s a pay-what-you-want plan, so you&#39;ll have access to those features without having to pay a monthly or annual fee.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The existing Cam Plus plan costs $2 per month or $15 per year. It supports back-to-back event recordings (instead of one every five minutes). Other features include full-length video recording for as long as motion is detected, and package, vehicle and pet detection.</p><p>Until now, Wyze cameras have captured 12-second clips as often as every five minutes when they detect an event, and those recordings are stored for up to 14 days. Wyze is moving that feature to its subscriptions, though, you&#39;ll need to opt in to the Cam Plus or Cam Plus Lite plan to keep using cloud recordings.</p><p>Wyze says it&#39;s <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/wyze-cam-plus-lite-subscription/">pairing</a> cloud recordings with the AI-powered Person Detection feature in the Cam Plus Lite plan to make them more useful and cut down on unnecessary notifications that might be triggered by a clip of, say, an insect flying in front of the camera. The company believes this approach will improve the overall experience, though it said it will incur significant cloud costs as a result. As such, while it won&#39;t make users pay for those features, it&#39;s hoping they&#39;ll contribute what they can to help cover the costs for everyone.</p><p>If you don&#39;t <a href="https://services.wyze.com/purchase/type/person-detection">opt in</a> to Cam Plus Lite, your cameras will store thumbnails of what they detect, rather than video. You&#39;ll still be able to sign up for Cam Plus Lite at any time.</p><p>Wyze is making some changes to the local storage options too. It will support microSDXC cards with more than 32GB of storage. That feature&#39;s available on Wyze Cam v3 now, and it&#39;s coming to the company&#39;s other cameras as part of their next firmware update. By the middle of February, Wyze will roll out 30-second rewind and skp forward buttons to help users zip through footage stored on a microSD card faster.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/wyze-cam-plus-lite-plan-a-pay-what-you-want-security-camera-211502333.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02592e1c-4b54-446f-a2f2-07c1a90c3807</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 21:15:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642021513</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T21:05:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ff264320-73e7-11ec-be5e-dd3944435101" width="799" height="561" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ff264320-73e7-11ec-be5e-dd3944435101" width="799" height="561" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wyze]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Wyze Cam V3.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wyze Cam V3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FCC proposes stricter requirements for reporting data breaches]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Communications Commission is the next US regulator hoping to hold companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-rules-that-health-apps-must-notify-consumers-if-their-data-is-breached-114043312.html">more accountable for data breaches</a>.
