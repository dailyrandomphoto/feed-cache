Crisis Text Line can be reached by texting HOME to 741741 (US), 686868 (Canada), or 85258 (UK). Wikipedia maintains </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines"><em>a list of crisis lines</em></a><em> for people outside of those countries.</em></p><p>Amazon is hitting the tail end of peak – the term the company uses to refer to the winter holidays, as well as its own corporate holiday, Prime Day – when its workers are under the greatest strain, frequently required to clock mandatory overtime hours and are disallowed from scheduling any vacation days. It also coincides with the hiring of a deluge of temporary workers, with a projected <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/amazon-plans-to-hire-150000-seasonal-staff-for-the-holiday-season.html">150,000</a> added this year, its largest holiday surge to date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s hectic during the best of times. But according to an internal email viewed by Engadget, and the testimonies of four current or former associates who were granted anonymity for fear of reprisal, it&#39;s also a time of year when Amazon expects some number of its workforce to take out their stress on their colleagues, or on themselves.</p><p>&quot;Peak is a busy time for our entire team as everyone is dedicated to helping customers receive their holiday packages on time. It&#39;s easy to feel stressed and overwhelmed,&quot; the leaked email, dated November 23, reads. &quot;And while most of us never pose a risk to others, some people can act out in a way that causes concern. This could be due to many factors in their lives, not just what they experience at work. <strong>Regardless of the cause, workplace violence is never the answer.</strong>&quot; [Emphasis theirs]</p><p>The worker who provided the email to Engadget could not recall similar messaging during previous peaks. &quot;I&#39;ve been with Amazon a little over four years now and they&#39;ve never mentioned anything about our mental status until now,&quot; they wrote in an email. &quot;Our leadership hasn&#39;t announced anything [other] than quota related issues.&quot;</p><p>The email goes on to draw a connection between the grueling workload of peak and the potential for self-harm. &quot;<strong>Remember that your mental health matters</strong>,&quot; it reads. &quot;If you experience stress, feelings of depression, anxiety, or thoughts of suicide, please talk with your manager, a human resources business partner, or a mental health professional.&quot; It directs workers to use the company&#39;s &quot;free, confidential counselors and other resources.&quot;</p><p>Two of the associates who spoke to Engadget recalled being shown a video, covering similar subject matter, during their training.</p><p>&quot;It was stupid things like call the employee resource center, and talking about &#39;if you feel like you want to harm somebody you can tell your supervisor and you&#39;ll be allowed to leave work and go home.&#39; It was just such bullshit,&quot; one recalled. The same associate stated that the employee resource center is &quot;like a black hole of &#39;press one for this&#39;, I don&#39;t even know how to talk to a real person there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They have a number you call if you start feeling suicidal or depressed from working too much,&quot; another told Engadget. &quot;They put a video on during training where they talked about how a lot of workers feel this way. And that was right after the reveal that we were not getting the schedules we wanted and we had to work 60 hours a week. After being told it would be 40.&quot;</p><p>A 2019 report in the Daily Beast <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/amazon-the-shocking-911-calls-from-inside-its-warehouses">publicized</a> some of the 911 calls that had been made from inside several of Amazon&#39;s warehouses, including a pregnant worker who threatened to stab herself and her unborn child. Jace Crouch, a former employee quoted in the story, said that &quot;people having breakdowns [are] a regular occurrence&quot; within these facilities.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to answer specific questions sent by Engadget, including whether the company had seen any uptick in workplace violence. Instead the company provided the following statement: “We know it’s been a tough year and a half for everyone, and like most large companies, we work to support our teams in many different ways. This includes providing resources throughout the year for anyone who may be dealing with stress in their personal lives or at work, and making sure they feel seen and able to ask for help if they need it.”</p><p><em>Are you a tech worker with concerns about your job, safety, or the work you&#39;re required to do?

As the <em>Associated Press</em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-business-health-medication-f3578e19f2840ce167f081ec9e236c3c">reports</a>, the Food and Drug Administration has given emergency use <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19-certain">authorization</a> for Merck&#39;s Molnupiravir pill. The treatment limits replication of SARS-CoV-2 by inserting &quot;errors&quot; in the virus&#39; genetic code while an infection is relatively young, ideally preventing mild or moderate cases from becoming severe in high-risk patients.</p><p>The medicine might not get as much use as Pfizer&#39;s Paxlovid, however. Merck&#39;s offering will only be available to those 18 years or older versus 12 years for Pfizer&#39;s, as there are concerns it might affect bone and cartilage development in younger patients. There are also warnings against using it during pregnancy or while attempting to conceive — the FDA said people should use birth control both during and after treatment, with women waiting days and men waiting three months.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Molnupiravir also doesn&#39;t appear to be as effective as Paxlovid. While Pfizer&#39;s solution reduced hospitalization and death by as much as 90 percent, Merck&#39;s only managed 30 percent. This pill may become the secondary option, particularly in situations where Paxlovid isn&#39;t available. Both companies&#39; products are expected to remain effective against the virus&#39; Omicron variant as they don&#39;t target mutating spike proteins.</p><p>Still, this might become another useful tool for minimizing COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Pfizer&#39;s pill will be the most readily available when the US is ordering enough to treat 10 million patients, but there will be enough of Merck&#39;s drug to address 3.1 million. Even if the effectiveness is limited, that could spare hundreds of thousands of people from the worst the disease has to offer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fda-merck-covid-19-antivirual-pill-molnupiravir-162951648.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e14985e3-732a-4bdd-bda9-ff681d0e96cb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 16:29:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640276993</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T16:30:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pharmaceuticals & Drug Trials]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/758059d0-6406-11ec-bffd-49a7a1a32902" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/758059d0-6406-11ec-bffd-49a7a1a32902" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Merck]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Merck molnupiravir COVID-19 antiviral pill]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Merck molnupiravir COVID-19 antiviral pill]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How the pandemic supercharged the creator economy in 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The multibillion dollar industry of game streamers, beauty vloggers, podcast producers, fitness influencers, newsletter writers and other social media stars who make up the “creator economy,” began long before 2021. Yet 2021 saw more platforms throw more money and resources at independent content <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/creators/">creators</a> than ever before.</p><p>This year, companies that had previously shown little interest in courting “influencers” or building relationships with creators began to invest in building monetization tools for them. And even more established, creator-friendly companies significantly ramped up their investments with new funds and tools.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter, which had previously only ever had a single monetization feature — a video centric tool used by publishers — opted to reorient <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-15th-anniversary-140008110.html">its entire platform</a> around creators. It built Super Follows, a Patreon-esque subscription service for influencers. It launched Ticketed Spaces, so people could make money from its burgeoning live audio feature. It launched in-app tripping, and started building a newsletter platform.</p><p>Snapchat, which at one time actively shunned the idea of influencers, just announced that it had funneled more than <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/spotlight-1-year-anniversary">$250 million</a> to creators via its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-launches-spotlight-tiktok-140020938.html">Spotlight</a> feature, which launched at the end of 2020. Some of the app’s biggest stars are even getting their own <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snapchat-creator-payout-250-million-1235132541/">shows</a> in Snapchat Discover.</p><p>Facebook also took a renewed interest in the influencers and content creators who had long asked for more opportunities from the platform. Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly labeled creators as one of the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q2-2021-earnings-214311750.html">top priorities</a> and announced a plan to invest $1 billion into tools for them by the end of 2022. Since then, Facebook and Instagram have launched a dizzying number of creator-focused updates and monetization features.</p><p>Platforms not traditionally associated with influencers also began throwing money at creators and monetization features. Pinterest launched a $500,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-creator-fund-creator-code-150013929.html">creator fund</a> and built its first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-shopping-idea-pins-affiliate-links-155149992.html">monetization tools.</a> LinkedIn — yes, that LinkedIn — announced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/linkedin-is-launching-its-own-25m-fund-and-incubator-for-creators/"> $25 million</a> fund. Clubhouse added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clubhouse-payments-060935128.html">tipping</a>. Tumblr, meanwhile, launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-post-plus-expansion-140056311.html">subscription service</a> for its bloggers.</p><p>Even YouTube, the most established platform for creators to make money, identified “growing the creator economy” as its top <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/letter-from-susan-our-2021-priorities/">2021 priority</a>. It launched an all-new $100 million fund <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-100-million-dollar-creator-fund-launch-160058966.html">just for Shorts</a>, its TikTok-like feature. TikTok itself, which started a $200 million fund <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-creator-fund-183231670.html">in 2020</a>, also launched <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-adds-creator-monetization-features-143319737.html">new monetization</a> features.</p><p>With all that money flowing in, it’s no surprise that the number of individual creators also boomed. One report from payments company Stripe, which powers payments for dozens of influencer platforms, found that the number of creators was <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/creator-economy">up 48 percent</a> in 2021, compared with 2020. And that’s just a “fraction” of the total ecosystem, according to the company.</p><p>“If the recent exponential growth of the creator economy keeps up, these 50 platforms could be supporting more than 15.5 million creators in five years,” the company wrote.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4fe4c1c0-628f-11ec-b6a9-3a5efd49a59b" alt="The number of creators has skyrocketed, according to Stripe." data-uuid="4e68bb58-a846-316f-a212-8ef76f077655"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Stripe</div></figure><p>Growth wasn’t limited just to the major platforms, either. Startups catering to content makers and their needs also surged, with more than $3.7 billion in funding going toward “startups focused on creators,” according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-creator-economy-investments-could-hit-5-billion-this-year?rc=whf0fd">a report</a> in <em>The Information.</em></p><p>One of the main drivers of this surge in activity was the pandemic. While creators were making money long before the pandemic, the industry was almost perfectly primed to absorb many of the changes brought on by it.</p><p>“I think the pandemic definitely turbocharged the creator economy through both necessity and through choice,” Li Jin, founder of Atelier Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in the creator economy, said in an interview earlier this year.</p><p>“Necessity meaning a lot of people were left without offline alternatives for work and income and had to turn to online platforms in order to continue their creative careers. And choice in the sense that obviously we had a lot of free time during the pandemic where we were just kind of stuck at home. I think a lot of people took that time and they started creating content.”</p><p>At the same time, the pandemic also seems to have shifted the way that many people think about work itself. While this year was full of hand-wringing about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/how-do-you-make-7-million-workers-disappear/620475/">labor shortages</a> and whether or not people want <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/business/jobs-workers-economy.html">to go back</a> to work, it’s not difficult to understand why some, particularly younger people, might opt for a different path. Zuckerberg described the shift as “​​people being able to make a living by expressing their creativity and by doing things they want to do, rather than things they have to.” Creators, he has said, deserve to be “rewarded” for their work,</p><p>But as Jin and others have pointed out, major platforms aren’t suddenly embracing creators just because they care about helping them create sustainable independent businesses. The economics are ultimately weighted in their favor as well.</p><p>Creators are responsible for a significant amount of engagement on their platforms of choice. If enough of an app’s biggest stars leave, they could take large chunks of users with them. Revenue from creators could also one day help Facebook generate income beyond advertising. Zuckerberg has pledged not to take a cut of their earnings <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-creators-earnings-cut-2023-paid-events-newsletters-164341439.html">until 2023</a>, but even a relatively small commission could eventually add up to a significant amount. Likewise, Twitter has said it plans to take a 20 percent cut of Super Follow subscriptions from its highest-earning creators, though it could still be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">some time</a> before the feature makes serious cash for anyone.</p><p>Creators are also crucial to drawing in new users and keeping platforms’ existing ones entertained. For Facebook, they could help the company avoid, or at least dampen, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks">“existential threat”</a> of declining teen users. Snapchat has touted Spotlight as a key source <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-q4-2020-earnings-220645065.html">of growth</a>. Even LinkedIn has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/meet-first-class-linkedins-creator-accelerator-program-andrei-santalo/">said</a> creators can help their users get  “better at what they do.”</p><p>Ultimately, though, it’s the platforms that will benefit most from creators, according to Jin. “Nothing is done purely altruistically,” she said. “It&#39;s to strengthen the company and their profitability.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-the-pandemic-supercharged-the-creator-economy-153050958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">db1bb273-90dc-46a4-9ba9-8d5c8bbec995</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 15:30:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640177464</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T12:51:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/004b1a10-628f-11ec-bf9f-ce9fedd2a294" width="3671" height="2206" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/004b1a10-628f-11ec-bf9f-ce9fedd2a294" width="3671" height="2206" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alessandro Biascioli via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Happy Asian woman wearing face mask and vlogging online using smartphone cam and influencer led while drinking a coffee sitting in bar during corona virus outbreak]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Happy Asian woman wearing face mask and vlogging online using smartphone cam and influencer led while drinking a coffee sitting in bar during corona virus outbreak]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's Elite 85t earbuds drop to an all-time low of $140 for today only]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re scrambling for a last-minute audio gift or IOU — you have good timing.

But the event also served to highlight the extent of what needs to be done if humanity’s going to survive beyond the next century.</p><p>One “victory” out of the event was the belief that ensuring global warming held at 1.5 degrees was still possible. It’s worth saying, however, that <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/unep-1-5c-climate-target-slipping-out-of-reach">1.5 degrees</a> isn’t a target to meet so much as an acceptance of impending disaster. In October, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf">the IPCC</a> explained that such a temperature increase will cause significant upticks in the frequency of extreme heat waves, monsoon-like rainfall and widespread droughts. Extreme weather events that may have taken place once every 50 years a few centuries ago could become a regular, and fatal, occurrence.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All the while, the facts of the matter are unchanged: Humanity needs to avoid adding new carbon emissions while also tackling those we’ve already emitted. That means an aggressive reduction of every man-made carbon-emitting process everywhere on Earth, the total reformation of agriculture and an unprecedented rollout of carbon capture and storage technology. And, ideally, that process should have begun the better part of two decades ago.</p><p>There are many dispiriting facts about the world, but one that always hurts is the fact that coal plants are <em>still</em> being greenlit. <a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-coal-plant-tracker/">Global Energy Monitor’s data</a> has plants currently being permitted or under construction in (deep breath) China, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Mongolia, Vietnam, Singapore, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Poland, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Brazil and Mexico. As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/coal-trajectory-is-set-whether-its-phase-out-or-phase-down-russell-2021-11-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a> says, each plant will be expected to run for at least 40 years, severely damaging efforts to go Carbon Negative. Not only is it in everyone’s best interest that these plants don’t go online, but wealthier nations have a moral obligation to help provide the funding to help at least some of those names move toward clean energy.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/87225780-6260-11ec-9b7b-e2dcc112d5c8" data-uuid="6fda6dd0-44d5-32f7-bc7c-0eae95148da0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tunvarat Pruksachat via Getty Images</div></figure><p>The problem is that electricity is going to be the most important resource of the 21st century, especially if we’re going to tackle climate change. Many key technologies, like transportation, will ditch fossil fuels in favor of electricity as their primary source of fuel. The world’s demand for energy is going to increase, and we’re going to need to generate that power cleanly. The US Center for Climate and Energy Solutions believes that, by 2050, the world’s power needs will jump by 24 percent. So where will we get all of this clean power from?</p><p>Fusion has, forever, been held up as a magic bullet that will totally eradicate our worries about energy generation. Unlike Nuclear Fission, it produces little waste, requires little raw fuel and can’t produce a runaway reaction. Unfortunately, Fusion remains as elusive as The Venus de Milo’s arms or a good new <em>Duke Nukem</em> game. ITER, the internationally-funded, French-built experimental reactor won’t be finished until 2025 at the earliest and is still just a testbed. If successful — and that’s a big if — we’re still a decade away from any serious progress being made, at which point mass decarbonization will already need to be well underway.</p><p>That means any power decarbonization will have to come from the renewable technology that’s available to us today. Nuclear, Wind, Solar, Geothermal and Tidal power all need to be ramped up to fill in the gap, but the scale of the task in the US alone is staggering. According to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3">EIA</a>, the US generated just short of 2,500 billion kWh using fossil fuels in 2020. If you wanted to, for instance, replace all of that with nuclear power, you’d need to build anything in the region of 300 reactors, or increase the number of solar panels installed in the US by roughly a hundred percent — and that’s before we talk about intermittency.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/746d99e0-51f5-11ec-bffe-0874e42b9891" alt="Urtopia ebike." data-uuid="c7b726a6-2124-31c0-9dbe-f1d26fb84425"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>One thing we can do, however, is to reduce our demand for energy to lessen the need for such a dramatic shift. That can be, for instance, as easy as better insulating your home (in cold climates) or improving the efficiency of AC systems (in warm climates). Another smart move is to ditch the car in favor of public transportation, walking, or getting on your bike. There is evidence that e-bike adoption is becoming a big deal, with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2020/12/02/e-bike-sales-to-grow-from-37-million-to-17-million-per-year-by-2030-forecast-industry-experts/?sh=154cbaeb2876"><em>Forbes</em></a> saying that sales are tipped to grow from just under 4 million annually in 2020 to close to 17 million by 2030.</p><p>None of this, however, will matter much unless we can also find a way to pay off the debts humanity has racked up over the last century. The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_SPM_version_report_LR.pdf">IPCC</a> believes that we need to extract up to one trillion tonnes of atmospheric CO2 in the near future. This can be done with massive tree planting works, more of which needs to be done, but also this process may need a little help.</p><p>That’s why a number of startups have been working on industrial processes to extract CO2 from the atmosphere. Right now, such a process is very expensive, but it’s hoped that as the technology improves, the cost will start to tumble. There’s also a concern, of course, that running schemes like this will give polluting companies and nations a free license to avoid reform.</p><p>As much as we can hope that this technology matures quickly, the rate of progress needs to get a lot faster a, uh, <em>lot </em>faster. For instance, Climeworks’ Orca, its new flagship carbon capture plant in Iceland, will extract 4,000 tons of CO2 per year. If we’re going to reach the point where we can avert a climate catastrophe using extraction alone, we’ll need this capacity to increase by about a hundred million times.</p><p>The point of this is, broadly speaking, to outline how much more sharply our attitudes toward the climate need to shift. If we’re going to succeed at defeating climate change then we’re going to need to go onto the sort of war footing – where resources are devoted to nothing but solving the crisis – that few can ever imagine undertaking. But, as most of the resources point out, the only way that we’re going to stave off the damage after dragging our feet for so long is to go all-out in search of a solution.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cop26-climate-change-resolution-carbon-emissions-143037481.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e47c537-9af4-4f8f-9770-25e71a806b0f</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 14:30:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640271278</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T14:54:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/45194840-619c-11ec-bf3f-d25ff81ecf83" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/45194840-619c-11ec-bf3f-d25ff81ecf83" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[INA FASSBENDER via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TOPSHOT - Open-cast lignite mining is seen near the coal-fired power station Neurath of German energy giant RWE in Garzweiler, western Germany, on October 27, 2021. - From October 31 to November 12, the 26th World Climate Conference (COP26) will take place in Glasgow, Scotland.

Somewhere around season three or four the show finds its way and actually becomes good, if not great. This isn’t a phenomenon limited to Trek, of course, but only Trek has a specific name for it: <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">growing the beard</a>. This is in reference to commanders William Riker and Benjamin Sisko, who both started their respective shows clean-shaven but grew beards around the time <em>The Next Generation</em> and <em>Deep Space Nine</em> got noticeably better. And <em>Discovery</em> might finally be ready to do its own metamorphosis, but instead of a beard it’s a change of format that has fans talking.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the complaints about <em>Discovery</em>’s first three seasons — besides the grimdark tone, the infallibility of Michael Burnham and all the <em>crying</em> — was that it largely embraced a more serial format, where each episode was another installment in one long ongoing storyline. Sure, there were occasional one-off adventures, but each episode was still firmly focused on the larger story.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5705a470-636f-11ec-86f7-4c6c0c2b61ff" style="height:800;width:1200;" alt="Pictured: Anthony Rapp as Stamets of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

However, unlike previous seasons where each episode would have been focused on one step toward finding a solution, the problem-solving has taken a back seat to a largely standalone A-plot.</p><p>The shift could be first seen in episode three, where Burnham and her crew are tasked with tracking down a rogue member of the Qowat Milat (as I described them to my editor: ninja nuns). The DMA is more of a C-plot in this episode, with the B-plot position occupied by the story of Gray Tal and his new android body. Episode four was Tilly trying to train and keep a group of Starfleet cadets alive (in a plot reminiscent of Voyager episodes ‘<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Learning_Curve_(episode)">Learning Curve</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Good_Shepherd_(episode)">Good Shepherd</a>’). Episode five saw the crew tasked with evacuating a planet threatened by the DMA. The anomaly may have been the instigating force in the episode, but it was in fact interchangeable with pretty much any other planetary threat since the episode was focused more on Michael’s struggle to free six prisoners on the surface.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7433e340-636f-11ec-bbfd-b66398fd2481" style="height:800;width:1200;" alt="Pictured: David Ajala as Book of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

All Rights Reserved." data-uuid="4b3d4679-4eb8-3b25-97e5-f385c270c02f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>This week’s episode finds <em>Discovery</em> traveling into a subspace rift created by the DMA and becoming stranded, with the ship’s newly sentient AI Zora unable to lead the crew to safety. However, while the anomaly is once again the cause of Discovery’s problems it’s also, once again, an interchangeable threat. The real drive of the episode is the problem-solving to get the crew out, and the personal struggles of characters like Zora and Cleveland Booker.</p><p>Next week will bring the Dark Matter Anomaly back to the forefront, but that’s only logical since the seventh episode marks the rough midpoint of the 13-episode season as well as the end of our calendar year. It’s not unusual for many television shows to use this time to “check in” on their major storylines and advance those plots to the next phase. But it is unusual for <em>Discovery </em>in that it doesn’t represent as clean a divide as in previous seasons: season one went from the Klingon War to the Mirror Universe, season two went from the mystery of the Red Angel to battling the evil AI Control. Next week’s episode represents a smoother transition than previously.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/91ef9500-636f-11ec-b2e5-8a1184d4a634" style="height:800;width:1200;" alt="Pictured: Ian Alexander as Gray of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

" data-uuid="a0a92894-d768-3d4b-8a51-db4d7eba9f5d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>That smoothness is mostly due to the fact that the ongoing storyline hasn’t been given as much time to openly flourish, instead bubbling in the background while the show instead focuses on character-building single-shot adventures. Standalone episodes might feel outdated in an era of streaming and binging, where viewers can get their answers right away so there’s no need to make each individual chapter feel “complete.” There’s no chance to become unsatisfied by the content of an episode when the next one is merely seconds away. Even shows that premiere week by week have fallen into the trap, assuming that most viewers will binge the show later on anyway, with only the diehards watching each installment as it drops.</p><p>But for most of its existence at this point, Star Trek has been a franchise for the die-hards. The people who can’t wait for the next episode, the people who will read and write recaps on their favorite pop culture sites and those who share theories on social media. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Paramount+" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/3PY0yk">Paramount+</a> has put a lot of its chips on the strength of this die-hard base, stacking its production schedule with five different Star Trek shows that rarely overlap, meaning a fan who wants to see everything as soon as possible will need to maintain their Paramount+ subscription all-year-round.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b9ff03a0-636f-11ec-bf76-034ceaae9d10" style="height:800;width:1200;" alt="Pictured: Grudge the cat of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

All Rights Reserved." data-uuid="4e7e082e-e4c5-34ce-b73b-d82d098a52d7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>While fan complaints may have played a big role in <em>Discovery</em>’s decision to switch to a more episodic format, it’s likely that the desire to keep fans on the hook for the show’s entire run played an even bigger part. When <em>Discovery</em> was the only Star Trek show, and one of the few Paramount+ offerings period, it was common for viewers to only sign up for a subscription when they wanted to binge something — sometimes even within the free week the service offers to new customers. Shows like <em>Lower Decks</em>, <em>Prodigy</em> and the upcoming <em>Strange New Worlds </em>already operate with a more episodic format, meaning <em>Discovery</em> could have created a “hole” in an ongoing subscription for viewers, a chance for them to take a break from Star Trek and from paying $6 a month.</p><p>With an episodic show it’s a lot harder to ignore it while it’s running; each episode represents a complete viewing experience, making the wait between episodes less excruciating. And when <em>Discovery</em> encounters new worlds and new adventures every week, it gives the fans something new to talk about, instead of rehashing the same old theories about the ongoing storyline again and again until the season ends. Star Trek was just made for episodic viewing, and embracing the format will make it easier for <em>Discovery</em> to hold fan interest over time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-season-four-episode-six-140053318.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">174045ac-7acb-4ad3-a026-06245c648a6a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 14:00:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640209837</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T21:50:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7cbf4390-636c-11ec-bffb-130f907d29c9" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7cbf4390-636c-11ec-bffb-130f907d29c9" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pictured: Sonequa Martin Green as Burnham and Doug Jones as Saru of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

The workers originally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-staten-island-warehouse-unionization-drive-193814629.html">filed</a> a petition with the National Labor Relations Board back in November, but they had to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/12/amazon-union-withdraws-staten-island/">withdraw</a> it after failing to gather enough signatures to be approved. This time, the organizers were reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/business/amazon-union-staten-island.html">able to gather</a> over 2,500 worker signatures or half of the 5,000 people employed at the facility.</p><p>The workers are hoping to form the Amazon Labor Union, which will be an independent group that&#39;s not connected to any major national union. One of their lead organizers is Christian Smalls who led a walkout at JFK8 over the e-commerce giant&#39;s handling of COVID safety at the warehouse. Amazon fired Smalls after that, telling <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/amazon-fires-staten-island-coronavirus-strike-leader-chris-smalls.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> that he &quot;received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines.&quot; Even so, Smalls is still very much involved in the facility&#39;s renewed efforts to unionize. In an email to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/22/amazon-warehouse-union"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, he referenced what happened at Amazon&#39;s Bessemer warehouse, saying that &quot;long drawn-out voting processes are controlled by the bosses who use that period to lie to, intimidate and threaten the workers into voting no for the union.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Majority of the workers at the company&#39;s Bessemer, Alabama facility voted against unionization back in April. However, the election was fraught with controversy, with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) — the union the workers were supposed to join — accusing Amazon of interfering with the elections. One of the main issues they pointed out was that the company installed the ballot box in front of the warehouse and in view of security cameras, making workers feel as if their votes were being monitored. After looking into the RWDSU&#39;s complaint, the NLRB <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-election-rerun-073943796.html">ordered</a> Amazon to hold another vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon has been adamantly opposed to its workers joining unions. When the people at JFK8 first filed a petition to unionize, the e-commerce giant told <em>Engadget</em> in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;As a company, we don’t think unions are the best answer for our employees. Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes — quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle. The benefits of direct relationships between managers and employees can’t be overstated — these relationships allow every employee’s voice to be heard, not just the voices of a select few. We’ve made great progress in recent years and months in important areas like pay and safety. There are plenty of things that we can keep doing better, and that&#39;s our focus — to keep getting better every day.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The NLRB has confirmed to<em> The Post</em> that it received the group&#39;s petition and would be reviewing signatures over the coming days.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-workers-new-york-forming-a-union-123540725.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fd4be302-2109-4de2-bc0d-a853aa0efb9b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 12:35:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640258089</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T11:15:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Unions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/39e8dd50-0d4c-11eb-9b7f-794e3a884a0b" width="3200" height="2136" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/39e8dd50-0d4c-11eb-9b7f-794e3a884a0b" width="3200" height="2136" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephanie Keith via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - MAY 01: People protest working conditions outside of an Amazon warehouse fulfillment center on May 1, 2020 in the Staten Island borough of New York City.

The main drawback is with the sleep tracking. Unlike devices from Fitbit and Samsung, the Watch Series 7 can&#39;t detect what sleep zone you&#39;re in, for one thing. And it won&#39;t detect when you&#39;ve fallen asleep, so you&#39;ll need to make sure you have the Sleep Focus mode to log your slumber.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, Apple&#39;s Watch is the best selling smartwatch by far for good reason, and as the latest model, the Series 7 is the benchmark. With $60 off the price, there&#39;s never been a better time to get one.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-new-low-of-339-102843737.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4298778d-4517-4b7a-a108-4e03911eed6b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 10:28:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640260702</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T11:58:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cf5ba60-63d6-11ec-b7db-95c38703617e" width="1861" height="1090" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cf5ba60-63d6-11ec-b7db-95c38703617e" width="1861" height="1090" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 falls to a new low of $339 at Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 falls to a new low of $339 at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's 2022 TVs and monitors will support its new HDR10+ Gaming standard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung&#39;s 2022 televisions and monitors will support its recently unveiled <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1635416918">HDR10+ Gaming</a> standard, the company <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-delivers-premium-hdr-gameplay-with-hdr10plus-gaming-standard-support-for-its-new-screens">announced</a>.

Apple typically shutters a retail store if around 10 percent of its employees had tested positive for COVID-19, the news agency said.&nbsp;</p><p>The following locations have been closed since Tuesday:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><ul><li><p>Dadeland in Miami</p></li><li><p>The Gardens Mall in Palm Beach</p></li><li><p>Lenox Square in Atlanta</p></li><li><p>Cumberland Mall in Atlanta</p></li><li><p>Highland Village in Houston</p></li><li><p>Summit Mall in Ohio</p></li><li><p>Pheasant Lane in New Hampshire</p></li><li><p>Sainte-Catherine in Montreal</p></li></ul><p>The company also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-closes-stores-over-covid-19-surge-213559316.html">shut down</a> stores in Hawaii, Maryland, Ohio, Ottawa (Canada) and Texas earlier this month, though it only lasted for a few days. One of its retail locations in Miami, however, remains shuttered. The company told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a statement: &quot;We regularly monitor conditions, and we will adjust our health measures to support the well-being of customers and employees. We remain committed to a comprehensive approach for our teams that combines regular testing with daily health checks, employee and customer masking, deep cleaning and paid sick leave.&quot;</p><p>Perhaps in an effort to persuade people to shop online instead, Apple is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/22/apple-store-free-two-hour-delivery/">offering</a> customers &quot;free two-hour courier delivery on eligible in-stock items.&quot; The offer doesn&#39;t apply to &quot;customized Mac, engraved products and... certain order types including orders paid for with financing or by bank transfer.&quot; But so long as the product is eligible and available — it&#39;s the holidays and companies are still struggling from component shortages, so availability will most likely be limited — buyers can get their orders delivered for free if they order before 12PM on December 24th.</p><p>Apple had taken other steps earlier this month following the rise in cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant.

Designed for enterprise servers, the PM1743 SSD can hit read speeds of up to 13,000 MB/s and handle 2,500K input/output operations per second (IOPS) — nearly double what the best <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-pcie-gen4-ssds-form-factors-110503818.html">PCIe 4.0 NVMe</a> drives can do.&nbsp;</p><p>PCIe 5.0 supports up to 32 gigatransfers per second (GT/s), double that of PCIe 4.0. To harness that bandwidth, Samsung developed a proprietary controller and worked with Intel to test it. &quot;Together, we have jointly resolved complicated technical issues encountered with PCIe 5.0 during this initial evaluation period,&quot; said Intel&#39;s Technology Initiatives Director Jim Pappas.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The SSD delivers sequential write speeds of 6,600 MB/s and a random write speed of 250K IOPS, again nearly doubling current specs. It also offers improved power efficiency of up to 30 percent. &quot;This is expected to lower server and data center operating costs significantly, while also helping to reduce their carbon footprint,&quot; Samsung wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>While PCIe 5.0 is now inevitable, the next version isn&#39;t far behind, either. The PCI Special Interest Group has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-18-pci-express-6-specification.html">unveiled</a> a PCI Express 6.0 specification that could hit up to a blistering 256GB per second across 16 lanes — twice as fast as PCIe 5.0 and four times quicker than the 4.0 spec. However, that format will need to use a new trick called Pulse Amplitude Modulation technology that can carry twice as much data as existing methods without the need to use ridiculously high frequencies.</p><p>Samsung is now sampling the PM1743 PCIe 5.0 SSD for select customers and has plans to mass produce it in the first quarter of 2022, with capacities ranging from 1.92 terabytes (TB) to 15.36TB. It&#39;s also expected to be the first PCIe 5.0 SSD with dual-port support, guaranteeing server operation when a connection to one port fails. The first customers  are likely to be data centers, but such technology usually trickles down to consumers a year or so later — so plan accordingly if you have any 16K video editing projects or whatever coming up.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-teases-pci-50-ssd-that-can-hit-13000-m-bs-read-speeds-070308575.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">da9dabd8-56a7-401c-badb-6e46930c23e6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 07:03:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640242992</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T07:03:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a0e7d740-63bd-11ec-8ffb-9a9a4af090e9" width="2000" height="1415" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a0e7d740-63bd-11ec-8ffb-9a9a4af090e9" width="2000" height="1415" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung teases a PCI 5.0 SSD that can hit 13,000 MB/s read speeds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung teases a PCI 5.0 SSD that can hit 13,000 MB/s read speeds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG made some wild curved OLED concepts for CES 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG Display will showcase two flexible OLED concepts at CES 2022 – assuming the pandemic doesn’t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-meta-t-mobile-drop-out-of-ces-2022-085845578.html">claim the annual trade show</a> as its latest victim.

The treatment is meant for high-risk people 12 and older who could progress to a more serious COVID infection. The best part? The FDA says it could be available to use within a few days, making it another tool as we face the Omicron variant wave.</p><p>Paxlovid is available by prescription only, and it&#39;s meant to be taken within five days of first noticing COVID symptoms. According to Pfizer&#39;s tests, it can prevent hospitalization or death by 88 percent in high-risk patients. The treatment, which can be prescribed to both vaccinated and unvaccinated people, consists of 30 pills taken over five days. It includes the protein inhibitor nirmatrelvir and rotinavir, which keeps that inhibitor from breaking down in your body. Side effects include an impaired sense of taste, high blood pressure, diarrhea and muscle aches.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“This authorization provides a new tool to combat COVID-19 at a crucial time in the pandemic as new variants emerge and promises to make antiviral treatment more accessible to patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19,&quot; Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.</p><p>So far, the US has ordered enough pills to treat 10 million people, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/health/pfizer-covid-pill-fda-paxlovid.html"><em>New York Times reports</em></a>. The company plans to deliver enough pills to cover 65,000 Americans within a week. And after that, production is expect to ramp up, with 150,000 courses delivered in January and 150,000 in February. It also won&#39;t be the only antiviral pill around: Merck&#39;s competing treatment is expected to be approved soon, and it&#39;ll likely be more readily available than Pfizer&#39;s. Merck&#39;s option is far less effective, though—tests show it can only prevent hospitalization or death by 30 percent. (Still, that&#39;s better than having no treatment.)&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fda-pfizer-covid-antiviral-pill-paxlovid-205104688.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e6bb1c3-81af-4cab-8891-b85e6b9d360b</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 20:51:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640249210</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T08:47:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pharmaceuticals & Drug Trials]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e52aa760-6364-11ec-9f5d-7df1ad02bf38" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e52aa760-6364-11ec-9f5d-7df1ad02bf38" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HANDOUT / AFP]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[(FILES) This file handout photo provided to AFP on November 16, 2021 courtesy of Pfizer shows the making of its experimental Covid-19 antiviral pills, Paxlovid, inside his laboratory in Freiburg, Germany.

A message told Thea-Mai Baumann she was suspended for impersonation, though she had never pretended to be anyone else. Her account was returned after <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/13/technology/instagram-handle-metaverse.html"><ins>wrote a story</ins></a> about the ordeal, but the company never offered an explanation for how the mistake was made.</p><p>While what happened to her was unusual, one aspect of Baumann’s story is more common: that people who are wrongfully suspended from their social media accounts often have little or no recourse for getting them back (at least, not without media attention).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now that group may have another option. The “robot lawyer” company DoNotPay, which offers automated legal services, has a new offering: getting social media accounts <a href="https://donotpay.com/learn/how-to-get-unbanned"><ins>unbanned</ins></a>.</p><p>The new service, which is included with DoNotPay’s $36 monthly subscription, offers users an alternative to emailing companies’ help center bots or wiring appeals that may never get answered. Instead, DoNotPay asks users for information about what happened to them, and sends a letter to the relevant company’s legal department on their behalf.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/473f6200-635c-11ec-acff-b2dcfeb03dbc" style="height:377;width:595;" alt="the service can help get banned accounts back online." data-uuid="5314bfe9-870d-303d-a44b-7cdba77ad809"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DoNotPay</div></figure><p>“These platforms prioritize legal cases,” DoNotPay CEO Joshua Browder tells Engadget. “When you&#39;re just writing into customer service, they don&#39;t really take it seriously.” Legal departments, on the other hand, are much more likely to respond, he says.</p><p>In the appeal, the company also tries to “match” your appeal with a “legal reason why they can&#39;t ban you,” using state and federal laws that may apply. The letter also includes a deadline for the company to respond. He says that so far PayPal and Instagram have been among the most-requested services for unbanning. But the service will work with other platforms as well, including Twitter, Snapchat, Uber, Tinder, YouTube, Twitch and others.</p><p>Crucially, Browder points out that the service is not intended for people who were banned from a platform for legitimate reasons, like violating its terms of service. And even for those who were wrongly suspended, he estimates the odds of actually getting an account back as the result of this process are around 20 percent.</p><p>But even if the appeal isn’t ultimately successful, Browder says there are other benefits to the process. For one, companies are required to turn over users’ data regardless of whether their account was suspended. So even if you are unable to, say, regain access to your Instagram account, DoNotPay can ensure the company hands over your account details. There’s also the fact that sending a legal demand letter can cause a much bigger headache for a company than ranting to customer service agents.</p><p>“In general in America, they do have the right to ban you,” Browder says. “We don&#39;t overstate that we can make miracles happen, but we can punish them a lot and get your data.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/do-not-pay-unban-social-media-194515590.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">549ed055-6b96-43f6-b3b5-63b3467f2640</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 19:45:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640202035</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T19:40:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c87ce760-635d-11ec-bdff-58a453a284bd" width="6664" height="4419" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c87ce760-635d-11ec-bdff-58a453a284bd" width="6664" height="4419" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[pressureUA via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kyiv, Ukraine - September 10, 2019: A paper cubes collection with printed logos of well-known social networks and online messengers, such as Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitter, and others.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[A Wall of Cubes with Social Media Apps]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Steam's Winter Sale offers discounts on 'Horizon Zero Dawn,' 'Deathloop' and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Steam’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/">Winter Sale is now underway</a>.

In any case, the latest twist in the saga of the grapes goes to show developers can&#39;t please everyone all the time, even when they&#39;re tackling apparent bugs.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-low-poly-grapes-update-patch-notes-174320095.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fe2110ec-492a-45c8-9d5c-f7b1bf8391ea</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 17:43:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640194111</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T17:41:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ace78820-6349-11ec-93f7-e1b52e67e688" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ace78820-6349-11ec-93f7-e1b52e67e688" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A low-polygon model of grapes in Final Fantasy XIV.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Low-poly grapes in Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Democrats push Mark Zuckerberg on Meta's actions prior to January 6th Capitol attack]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A group of 13 Democratic senators led by Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Jack Reed of Rhode Island has <a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/8/e/8e549129-0be3-4898-91be-2d57bd8c68ef/CFD18C9BE423C4F6DBBCD9CB52997CE0.2021.12.21---letter-to-meta-re-election-threats---final.pdf">called on Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg</a> to answer how Facebook handled misinformation enforcement ahead of the January 6th US Capitol attack. Citing documents and testimony <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">shared by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>, they say they want to know why the company &quot;prematurely&quot; removed safeguards it had in place before the 2020 presidential election.</p><p>&quot;This action allowed misinformation, disinformation, and violent rhetoric to return to the platform immediately following Election Day and in the lead-up to the January 6th insurrection,&quot; the group said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Many of the questions center around Meta&#39;s defunct Civic Integrity team. During her testimony before the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety and Data Security, Haugen said that the company dissolved shortly after the 2020 election. That&#39;s a claim Meta has consistently disputed.</p><p>&quot;We did not disband Civic Integrity,&quot; Guy Rosen, Meta vice president for integrity, told <a href="https://time.com/6104899/facebook-reckoning-frances-haugen/"><em>Time</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>in October. &quot;We integrated it into a larger Central Integrity team so that the incredible work pioneered for elections could be applied even further, for example, across health-related issues. Their work continues to this day.&quot;</p><p>To that point, the group asks Zuckerberg when Meta made the decision to disband the team and who ultimately made it. They also want to know what part of Meta is currently responsible for overseeing its efforts to prevent election-related misinformation, in addition to details like how many employees the company has assigned to that division. Beyond those questions, the group says they want to know how Meta plans to protect the integrity of future elections.</p><p>&quot;While we acknowledge the efforts Facebook took to prevent the spread of election-related misinformation and disinformation, violent rhetoric, and harassment prior to the 2020 elections, it clearly was not enough to prevent lies about the election from taking root on the platform and fueling violence against our democracy,&quot; Klobuchar, Reed and the 11 other senators said.</p><p>The group stops short of threatening regulatory action against Meta. It&#39;s possible the Senate could call on Zuckerberg to testify much like Instagram head <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-instagram-adam-mosseri-001751448.html">Adam Mosseri</a> was asked to do earlier this month. While most US lawmakers agree more needs to be done to regulate Facebook and other social media platforms, Democrats and Republicans have found little common ground on how to approach the issue.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senate-letter-to-mark-zuckerberg-meta-election-misinformation-171719009.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7eafd5d9-0384-4813-a8cc-76a9086587f8</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 17:17:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640193769</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T17:22:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/af8f7b10-31cf-11ec-bc7c-7fea7bbc8790" width="968" height="546" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/af8f7b10-31cf-11ec-bc7c-7fea7bbc8790" width="968" height="546" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Handout . / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies during a remote video hearing held by subcommittees of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee on "Social Media's Role in Promoting Extremism and Misinformation" in Washington, U.S., March 25, 2021.

The electric vehicle manufacturer notched records for both deliveries and profits this year despite a global <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sales-continue-to-surge-in-the-face-of-chip-shortages-190311024.html">chip shortage</a> that decimated supply chains worldwide, effectively kneecapping the rest of the automotive industry’s production capacity. However its financial successes were often overshadowed by Tesla’s continuing production quality issues, multiple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">NHTSA</a> and <a href="http://v/">SEC</a> investigations, high profile failures of its vaunted “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-price-availability-151630041.html">Full Self Driving</a>” system, as well as numerous vehicle recalls and delays for upcoming models. And with existing industry stalwarts like Ford, GM, Honda and the Volkswagen Group making concerted efforts to electrify their own offerings, could 2022 be the year that Tesla’s reign as top EV automaker finally ends?</p><h2>The Good</h2><p>2021 was, without a doubt, a banner year for Tesla’s bottom line. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-2020-production-half-million-cars-154826010.html">entered this year</a> having met its 2020 goal of producing a half-million vehicles (of which it delivered 499,550 to customers), a nearly 133,000 unit increase over 2019. By April, Tesla had produced a record 180,338 vehicles and delivered 184,800 of them. Demand remained strong throughout the first half of the year thanks, in part, to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cuts-entry-level-model-3-y-prices-151853489.html">price cuts on both the Model 3 and Model Y</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company then <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sets-delivery-record-by-building-and-shipping-200000-vehicles-in-q-2-213045738.html">broke its same record</a> in July, having built 200,000 vehicles over the past three months, earning Tesla $1.1 billion in net income during the same period. “Public sentiment towards EVs is at an inflexion point and, at this point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward,” Musk said during the Q2 earnings call.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Tesla’s record-breaking trend <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-posts-a-wildly-profitable-q3-despite-difficult-car-market-210905631.html">continued unabated through Q3</a> with the company rolling 237,823 vehicles off its production lines — nearly all of which were of the Model 3 and Model Y varieties — and delivering 241,300 of them. The company also began taking pre-orders for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-y-pre-orders-uk-delivery-date-192222135.html">UK version of the Model Y in October</a> and announced that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-y-amd-ryzen-china-174802550.html">those Model Ys destined for the Chinese market</a> would be receiving upgraded AMD Ryzen chipsets.</p><p>Tesla capped off its stellar financial year with announcements from Hertz that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html">it plans to order 100,000 vehicles</a> (though there <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-hertz-hasnt-ordered-100000-tesla-e-vs-yet-103529013.html">remains uncertainty about how that deal will actually play out</a>) and from Uber Eats that it intends to rent as many as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-rents-tesla-evs-to-drivers-131556170.html">50,000 Tesla vehicles to its drivers</a>.</p><h2>The Bad</h2><p>While Tesla enjoyed unabashed sales success with its core lineup, the company often struggled to meet release deadlines for a number of its yet-to-be-released models. Both the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-delay-2022-150309858.html">Cybertruck</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delays-semi-truck-2022-102502178.html">Semi</a> have both been pushed back to 2022 while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-roadster-delay-2023-202010781.html">the Tesla Roadster reportedly won’t be arriving</a> until <em>at least</em> 2023. Tesla also took the strange tack of releasing an “entry-level” standard range Model Y for just a few weeks <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-stops-taking-model-y-standard-range-orders-192226812.html">before discontinuing the trim level</a>. Similarly, Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-delivery-date-152029394.html">pushed back the release</a> of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-first-deliveries-075110301.html">$130,000 Model S Plaid edition</a> to June 10th, debuting it mere days after Musk unilaterally announced that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-says-tesla-model-s-plaid-plus-canceled-211804141.html">the Model S Plaid+ was canceled outright</a>,</p><p>The company was also beset by a wide array of production woes and vehicle recalls this year. In February, Tesla bowed to pressure from the NHTSA and recalled 135,000 Model X and S vehicles on account of faulty touchscreens. That same month, Tesla was forced to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-x-recall-germany-kba-160928114.html&#39;">issue a recall for another 12,300 Model Xs</a> on account of loose trim panels. In April, customers reported that the company had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telsa-customers-double-charged-for-cars-082515018.html">double-charged them for their vehicles</a>, up to $71,000 in some cases, though <a href="http://v/">Tesla was quick to reimburse the affected buyers</a> and even threw in a $200 gift certificate for the company store.</p><p>June saw yet another recall, this time for 6,000 Model 3 and Ys over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-recalls-loose-bolts-model-3-y-140841331.html">faulty brake caliper bolts</a>, and in October, Tesla had to recall another set of Ys and 3s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-recall-suspension-model-y-3-191031712.html">because their suspensions kept separating</a>. Just last month, the company had to pull nearly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-braking-recall-software-glitch-132442476.html">12,000 vehicles from across its product line</a> on account of software issues — that’s not to be confused with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-app-outage-locked-owners-out-025004678.html">the recent Tesla App outage</a> that locked drivers around the world out of their own vehicles.</p><p>Tesla’s parade of crises also extended to the production lines themselves with the Fremont factory facing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fremont-factory-covid-19-cases-200515835.html">a sizeable COVID outbreak shortly after reopening in March</a>. Musk complained often and loudly throughout 2020 over California’s quarantine lockdown laws and finally made good on threats to take his toys and go home, officially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-moving-headquarters-texas-030729064.html">moving Tesla’s headquarters to Texas</a> in October.</p><p>The company was also ordered to pay <a href="http://v/">$137 million to former employee Owen Diaz</a> after a San Francisco federal court jury found Tesla liable for the unconscionable racial bigotry Diaz faced while working at the Fremont plant. That lawsuit has been followed up by another, filed in November by Jessica Barraza who alleged “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fremont-sexual-harassment-suit-185934119.html">rampant sexual harassment</a>” as well as continued verbal and physical abuse while she worked at the Fremont location.</p><div id="76008a59f00e4a888bed839cd99a501b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you want the Tesla Full Self-Driving Beta downloaded to your car, let us know.

Version 9’s rollout coincided with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-price-availability-151630041.html">new FSD subscription program</a> charging customers $199 a month (or $99 a month if they’d previously purchased the now-discontinued Enhanced Autopilot feature) — assuming they already had the $1,500 FSD computer hardware installed in their vehicle.</p><p>However, Tesla’s decision to abandon radar-based autonomation sensors <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-vision-autopilot-230045425.html">in favor of an optical-only setup in May</a> led to a backlash from the NHTSA which subsequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-safety-tesla-080857344.html">forced the company to remove some of its driver-assist designations</a> such as forward collision and lane departure warnings. In an effort to counter claims that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-using-autopilot-study-finds-072247148.html">use of the Autopilot feature can cause drivers to become inattentive</a> and less responsive once they resume control of the vehicle, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-in-car-camera-autopilot-081511875.html">Tesla activated its in-car driver monitoring cameras</a> in late May.</p><div id="362867a9ef944dea9706df41ed9b7b51"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Qxi8OhCmOI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">FSD beta 10 arrived to great fanfare in September</a> with owners noting smoother turns on city streets, improved display visuals and an overall improvement in the vehicle’s off-highway navigation. Those feelings were short-lived when, in October, the company was forced to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-pulls-latest-self-driving-beta-over-left-turn-and-other-issues-063331006.html">revert its beta 10.3 implementation</a> after becoming aware of &quot;some issues,&quot; per Musk, including a &quot;regression&quot; with left turns. Users also reported phantom forward-collision warnings and auto-steering bugs.</p><p>The company’s FSD faults — which have been implicated in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-ordered-hand-over-autopilot-data-nhtsa-073520497.html">multiple crashes where Teslas inexplicably rammed into first responder vehicles</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-investigation-192733573.html">other civilian drivers</a> as well as a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fatal-tesla-crash-driverless-200259765.html">widely-reported wreck in Houston</a> with nobody behind the wheel — has led to calls for increased scrutiny from and by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">NHTSA</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ntsb-head-on-tesla-full-self-driving-safety-170443851.html">NTSB</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senators-ftc-tesla-autopilot-full-self-driving-192943873.html">the US Senate</a>, and even the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-dmv-has-tesla-under-review-over-musks-fsd-claims-220447099.html">California DMV</a>.</p><p>The FSD feature also prompted a 300,000-unit recall at the behest of the Chinese government over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-issue-recall-china-145602238.html">ease in which FSD can be activated</a>, though that was far from the only issue Tesla faced with the nation. In April, China banned Tesla vehicles from its military bases and “key state-owned companies” over fears that the cars’ myriad cameras <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-military-bans-tesla-cars-162136546.html">could be leveraged for espionage</a>. After nearly a month of wrangling and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-chinese-social-media-spying-fears-131002911.html">appeals to social media</a>, Tesla finally caved to China’s cybersecurity demands and established a local clearinghouse for that data.</p><h2>The Musk</h2><p>And what would a Year in Review of Tesla be without a look back at CEO Elon Musk’s unique brand of shenanigans? <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-elon-musk-twitter-complaints-support-staff-185047267.html">Last October</a>, Musk unilaterally disbanded Tesla’s PR department, thereby making his personal Twitter account the first, last and only stop for confirmation of the company’s decisions. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-elon-musk-twitter-complaints-support-staff-185047267.html">This January</a>, Musk reversed course slightly and, instead of reforming the department, began hiring people to respond to customer complaints made toward him on the social media platform.</p><p>Speaking of tweets, Tesla was also sued this year for allegedly breaking a previously struck deal with the SEC by allowing Musk to continue sending <a href="http://v/">unapproved, &quot;erratic&quot; tweets</a> as well as for the company failing to obtain a neutral general counsel to reign in its CEO. The National Labor Relations Board also went after Tesla in 2021, finding that the company had illegally fired a union activist. The NLRB consequently demanded that the worker be rehired and Musk <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-ordered-to-delete-tweet-from-2018-111132733.html">delete a 2018 union-busting tweet</a> related to the case.</p><p>2021 was also the year that Musk leaned hard into crypto. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-to-take-bitcoin-payments-140109988.html">Tesla bought $1.5 billion worth of the stuff in February</a> and briefly toyed with the idea of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-will-soon-let-you-buy-one-of-its-e-vs-with-bitcoin-082916783.html">allowing customers to use the currency to purchase its vehicles</a>, though those plans were quickly canned over concerns about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-bitcoin-221708146.html">Bitcoin mining’s environmental impacts</a>. Musk also took time out of his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-to-host-saturday-night-live-202950558.html">Saturday Night Live hosting duties</a> in May to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-snl-host-dogecoin-171627334.html">crash the value of Bitcoin rival Dogecoin</a>, though his later tweets helped <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doge-musk-233459058.html">the price of Dogecoin rebound</a>, to a degree.</p><p>And then there was the whole Tesla “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-bot-humanoid-robot-033635103.html">Robot</a>” debacle, which I can’t even, I mean, it was literally just an actor in a spandex jumpsuit dancing around while Musk made a bunch of wildly unsubstantiated claims.</p><h2>What’s Next</h2><p>Looking ahead to 2022, Tesla appears to be on track for continued success. Its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-berlin-gigafactory-production-start-date-145218970.html">Berlin Gigafactory is nearly ready to start production</a> and is expected to do so by the end of this month – barring any unforeseen setbacks. The company’s stockpile of chipsets and <a href="https://insideevs.com/news/544742/tesla-battery-supply-deal-ganfeng/">aggressive maneuvers to shore up supplies</a> of battery precursor materials will insulate Tesla from many of the production bottlenecks that many other EV automakers are likely to struggle with throughout the new year.</p><p>However, even with Tesla’s record-breaking production figures from the past couple of years, the number of vehicles it delivers annually is still a small fraction of what more established automakers sell. BMW, for example, sold 2.3 million vehicles worldwide in 2020. In the same year, GM sold 2.5 million in the US <em>alone</em>. And as those companies increasingly turn their attention to the EV market while leveraging economies of scale that Tesla cannot match, Musk’s company could soon find itself relegated back to being a niche EV brand rather than an industry titan.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-had-a-phenomenal-2021-150044600.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">710f01f2-bd38-43d2-83ac-d544b04df53b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Dec 2021 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640171994</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T11:20:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6894ac80-56eb-11ec-b7df-457f6f710563" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6894ac80-56eb-11ec-b7df-457f6f710563" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Raindrops are seen on the logo of Tesla car in Milan, Italy on November 25, 2021.
