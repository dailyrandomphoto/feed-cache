According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/delta-pilot-sues-airline-for-1-billion-claiming-stolen-crew-app"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Captain Craig Alexander pitched the QrewLive app, which he reportedly developed with $100,000 of his own money, to the company as a way for crew to easily communicate in case of disrupted flights. However, Delta turned him down and then launched what he says is an identical tool a few years later.</p><p>Alexander apparently contacted Delta CEO Ed Bastian back in 2016 after a computer system meltdown put <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-08-delta-computer-system-meltdown.html">all flights on hold</a> and cost the company over $150 million. He told the CEO that he had a solution for issues like that, which resulted to several meetings with executives who <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/business/pilot-files-intellectual-property-lawsuit-against-delta/YM3GFTE3UNFOJMXOEWGUMYQIN4/">gave him</a> verbal assurances that they were going to acquire his app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Alexander&#39;s complaint, Delta ended up telling him that his technology didn&#39;t fit its needs and ultimately launched its own Flight Family Communications app in 2018. He called the official Delta app a &quot;carbon copy, knock-off of the role-based text messaging component of [his] proprietary QrewLive communications platform.&quot; As for how he decided to seek $1 billion in damages, he said it&#39;s &quot;based solely upon operational cost savings to Delta, [which] conservatively exceeds $1 billion.&quot;</p><p>The plaintiff has been with the airline for 11 years and still currently works with the company. Delta spokesperson Morgan Durrant told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a statement: &quot;While we take the allegations specified in Mr. Alexander&#39;s complaint seriously, they are not an accurate or fair description of Delta&#39;s development of its internal crew messaging platform.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/delta-pilot-sues-airline-app-063637349.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc54dfb2-9b56-4fab-8735-125708018c07</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 06:36:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626331035</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T06:37:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98ff79d0-e531-11eb-bfdf-b17a4cea27fd" width="4256" height="2482" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98ff79d0-e531-11eb-bfdf-b17a4cea27fd" width="4256" height="2482" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mindaugas Dulinskas via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Narita, Japan - January 25, 2017: N674US Boeing 747 Delta Air Lines Landing in International Narita Airport, Japan.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[N674US Boeing 747 Delta Air Lines Landing in International Narita Airport, Japan.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix will reportedly offer video games within the next year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-exclusive-rights-universal-animated-films-105446842.html">Netflix</a> may be a TV show, movie <em>and</em> game streaming platform in the near future. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/netflix-plans-to-offer-video-games-in-expansion-beyond-films-tv"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company has hired Mike Verdu, a former Oculus and EA exec, as vice president of game development. Verdu was the VP of augmented and virtual reality games and content at Facebook, where he worked with developers for the Oculus Rift, Quest and Go. From 2017 to 2018, he was also the head of EA Mobile and oversaw the studios that worked on <em>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</em>, <em>SimCity BuildIt</em>, <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> and <em>Sims Free Play</em>, among others.</p><p>The company will reportedly build out its gaming team in the coming months to be able to start offering games for streaming within the next year. Netflix isn&#39;t exactly inexperienced in the area and previously developed games based on its popular shows. However, it released those titles on mobile and consoles — <em>Bloomberg</em> says the company won&#39;t be making a separate platform for its upcoming video games and will instead make them available alongside its shows and movies under their own category. Also, the streaming giant reportedly has no plans to charge extra for game access, though it&#39;s unclear if the additional content will lead to a future price hike.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With competitors popping up left and right, Netflix has been looking for ways to grow and make sure it stays ahead, especially in saturated markets like the US. Adding video games to its repertoire seems to be the answer it came up with recently. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"><em>The Information</em></a> first reported that the company was seeking to hire an executive who&#39;d oversee its expansion into video games back in May. Apparently, Netflix approached several veteran execs in the industry regarding the position. Back then, a company spokesperson told <em>The Information</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Our members value the variety and quality of our content. It&#39;s why we&#39;ve continually expanded our offering— from series to documentaries, film, local language originals and reality TV. Members also enjoy engaging more directly with stories they love — through interactive shows like <em>Bandersnatch</em> and <em>You v. Wild</em>, or games based on <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>L Casa de Papel</em> and <em>To All the Boys</em>. So we&#39;re excited to do more with interactive entertainment.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c13aacd9-23ac-48a7-8a2c-36ba57da0684</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 04:58:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626332733</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T07:05:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/ce8fcf60-1ed5-11ea-b5fa-2646360f5138" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/ce8fcf60-1ed5-11ea-b5fa-2646360f5138" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvin Samuel Tolentino Pineda via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Calgary, Alberta.

That&#39;s about to change, and eventually you&#39;ll no longer need to have a phone nearby to use WhatsApp on the web, macOS, Windows or Portal.</p><p>Starting today, WhatsApp will invite users to try its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-multi-device-support-soon-132418897.html"><ins>multi-device beta</ins></a>. You&#39;ll be able to use the service on your phone and up to four other devices (as long as they also aren&#39;t phones). WhatsApp will try the multi-device approach with a small group of people from its beta program. They&#39;ll be able to opt out of the beta later. With the help of those users, WhatsApp will optimize the multi-device experience and add some more features before rolling it out more broadly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although many users have been requesting multi-device support, it&#39;s taken WhatsApp some time to make that happen. It has built a system that retains end-to-end encryption while letting people sync data like contact names, archives and starred messages across devices.</p><p>Until now, the WhatsApp smartphone app has been an essential conduit for the service. Other platforms like the web and desktop apps maintain a consistent, secure link to the phone app and mirror the content. But if your phone battery dies or there&#39;s an issue with the smartphone app, you can&#39;t use WhatsApp on other platforms.</p><p>Through the multi-device beta, each device will have its own identity key. Currently, users have a single identity key (i.e. the one on their phone) to handle encrypted messages. WhatsApp has <a href="https://scontent.whatsapp.net/v/t39.8562-34/217392192_617386875906350_2307693746154839727_n.pdf/WhatsApp_Security_Whitepaper_V4_Preview.pdf?ccb=1-3&amp;_nc_sid=2fbf2a&amp;_nc_ohc=4NBatF5TfzwAX-aVLCC&amp;_nc_oc=AQmcb-mK8YRXFKR50jznycD5iL0Wr-cAEL2STU9EfokAGZIq6Fn9thP2YmymlwHht6o&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.whatsapp.net&amp;oh=e9995b3578767e0defaf6163c8a1424e&amp;oe=60F4C687">developed systems</a> it says will keep out eavesdroppers who try to add devices to a user&#39;s account and to minimize the number of times people need to confirm their identity across devices. You&#39;ll also have control over connected devices and see which ones are linked to your account.</p><p>Along with messages, WhatsApp will have E2EE support for voice and video calls as part of the multi-device beta. There won&#39;t be any impact on the way WhatsApp handles cloud backups.&nbsp;</p><p>Solving the issue of supporting E2EE across a user&#39;s devices can be tricky given that only devices that messages are sent to and from are supposed to be able to decrypt them.

Although Telegram works on multiple devices, its E2EE approach (Secret Chats) <a href="https://tsf.telegram.org/manuals/e2ee-simple"><ins>does not currently do so</ins></a>.

That’s one of the main takeaways from the company’s most <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/an-update-to-the-twitter-transparency-center"><ins>recent transparency report</ins></a>, which it shared on Wednesday.  Between July 1st and December 31st, 2020, Twitter says it took action against 964,459 accounts for abusive behavior. Compared to the first six months of 2020, that’s a 142 percent increase. Over the same timeframe, Twitter also removed more hateful content. On that front, the company says it took action against 1,126,990 accounts, a 77 percent increase from the 635,415 accounts it reprimanded in the first half of 2020.</p><p>What’s notable here is that the company attributes the latter increase to policy changes it put in place throughout 2020. Specifically, it calls out the fact that it began taking action on &quot;content that incites fear and/or fearful stereotypes about protected categories&quot; as a result of an uptick in harassment during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also calls out an expansion of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-hate-speech-rules-race-ethnicity-194849330.html">hateful conduct policy</a> in early December that saw the company prohibit language that “dehumanizes” people based on their race, ethnicity or national origin. Not mentioned in the report — but likely still something that had a positive effect — is the ban the company put in place in July against links to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bans-links-hateful-conduct-violence-010623900.html"><ins>content that promotes violence and hateful conduct</ins></a>.</p><p>In another part of the report, Twitter also attributes its recent success to better technology. As of the second half of last year, the company claims its automated moderation tools helped it take action against 65 percent of abusive tweets and other behavior before someone had to flag the content for its moderators. To put that percentage in perspective, those tools were about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-twitter-says-better-spotting-abusive-tweets-than-users.html"><ins>50 percent effective</ins></a> by late 2019.</p><p>Obviously, Twitter has yet to completely stop abuse, harassment and hate speech from taking place on its platform, but today’s report shows the company is at least making progress on its 2019 promise to “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-05-twitter-jack-dorsey-public-square-health.html"><ins>increase the health of public conversation</ins></a>.”&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-second-half-2020-transparency-report-184953614.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45e4cd13-e7a9-452f-90d1-11a68da11289</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 18:49:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626288596</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T18:50:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1457de20-e4d2-11eb-bb9d-f9d09caf80c1" width="3110" height="1949" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1457de20-e4d2-11eb-bb9d-f9d09caf80c1" width="3110" height="1949" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

Safari is getting some design updates, including easier access to reloading, sharing and Tab Groups in macOS Monterey, as well as improved navigation features in iOS 15.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the changes in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html#safari">macOS Monterey beta that we didn&#39;t like</a> was the removal of the tabs bar. Senior editor Devindra Hardawar pointed out that while the new menu in its place allowed Apple to devote more screen space to website content, it made sorting through your tabs messy and tedious. With today&#39;s beta release, though, Apple&#39;s brought back the standalone Tab bar, which will be enabled by default, like it was on Big Sur.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, you&#39;ll also get one-click access to controls including Reload and Sharing, as well as access to new features like Tab Groups from the toolbar. If you liked the thin menu that gave you more space for browsing, you can still adopt it, and Apple&#39;s refined this to make it easier to see page titles while you rack up more tabs.</p><p>These changes will also come to iPadOS in a future beta update, which is nice since deputy editor Nathan Ingraham <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-os-15-public-beta-preview-191514417.html#safari">also criticized the removal of the tab bar in our preview</a>.</p><p>On iOS 15, Apple&#39;s tweaked Safari to make it easier to use with one hand. When you&#39;re entering a search, the field will now appear on top of the keyboard so it&#39;s nearer the bottom of the screen, making it easier to edit your query. When you&#39;re done typing, you can dismiss the keyboard by swiping down on it. Apple also added a Reload option to the long-press menu on the left side of the tab bar.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven&#39;t already, you can enroll in Apple&#39;s beta program to check these previews out for yourself. But be warned, you&#39;ll need to be sure you want to risk running potentially unstable software. If you can&#39;t wait a bit longer for the stable release, make sure you back up your data before installing the updates. You can find out how to do so <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-get-ios-15-beta-available-today-172240291.html">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-fix-safari-tab-bar-design-third-ios-15-mac-os-monterey-beta-180648751.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f842ff64-066d-41ec-ac8d-e47881bcf8d8</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 18:06:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626286011</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T18:07:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8d832d30-c7be-11eb-b7d7-79b626b77a96" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8d832d30-c7be-11eb-b7d7-79b626b77a96" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Universal Control on macOS Monterey]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Universal Control on macOS Monterey]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Battlefield 2042’ will split cross-play between console generations]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>EA and DICE have shed some light on their plans for cross-play in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-gameplay-trailer-174550618.html"><em>Battlefield 2042</em></a>. While the feature is still in development, there likely won&#39;t be a way for all players to join the same lobbies.</p><p>During an upcoming invite-only technical playtest, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC players will be able to hop into games together. DICE is planning to split the player pool between gamers on those platforms and those on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. PC and console players can opt out from playing against each other, which might soothe concerns about the disparity between controllers and mouse and keyboard.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Dividing players between console generations might come as a disappointment to some, especially for those with friends who don&#39;t have a decent gaming rig or haven’t been able to snag a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S. However, it makes sense. The PS4 and Xbox One versions <a href="https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-video-details-151958457.html">will have smaller lobbies</a> than on PC and current consoles, with 64 players instead of 128, as well as slightly condensed maps. Gameplay will otherwise be the same on all platforms, including weather events like tornados.</p><p>Cross-progression is in the works too. Your progress and items (including ones you buy) will carry over from one platform to another, so if you hop between PC and PlayStation or Xbox, you’ll have access to all of your gear.</p><p>Elsewhere, DICE plans to use bots to fill out lobbies when needed to improve matchmaking and perhaps get you into matches faster. You can&#39;t opt out from using the bots, though players will always have priority over AI soldiers. If a player leaves mid-game, a bot will take over until someone else joins.&nbsp;</p><p>The bots should act in a similar way to human players, though they won&#39;t be able to use wingsuits or class-based abilities. The AI soldiers can carry out other tasks, like reviving teammates, calling in vehicles and capturing objectives. You’ll be able to battle bots in solo and co-op modes too.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-briefing-answering-your-reveal-questions">a blog post</a> covering these tidbits, DICE and EA spilled the beans about some other features, including vehicles, fully customizable loadouts and how different modes focus on certain areas of maps. Meanwhile, DICE said you won&#39;t be able to fight on every floor of a skyscraper, only the lobby and rooftop. More details about <em>Battlefield 2042 </em>will be revealed at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-play-live-spotlight-series-223554077.html">EA Play Live event</a> on July 22nd.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-cross-play-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x-pc-174805910.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0b8be361-d8a9-4024-b722-baf16775e142</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 17:48:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626290786</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T19:26:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3398290-c943-11eb-adbf-3bda51b8d5b9" width="640" height="360" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3398290-c943-11eb-adbf-3bda51b8d5b9" width="640" height="360" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA / DICE]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[RendeZook]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[RendeZook]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clubhouse unveils its new 'Backchannel' DM feature]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Clubhouse, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-launches-its-clubhouse-live-audio-rival-greenroom-130034550.html">oft</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-launches-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-110028076.html">cloned</a> invite-only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-clubhouse-app-130015640.html">audio chat platform</a> that recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-clubhouse-android-app-is-now-available-worldwide-082506070.html">expanded to Android</a>, has since its inception lacked a seemingly fundamental feature present on virtually every other social media app: the ability to directly message other users.

As noted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577063/lg-oled-r-rollable-tv-us-pricing-features-release-date"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, the company’s US website now says you can buy the set for $100,000. Previously, not only did LG not list the price of the OLED R in the US, you had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-rollable-oled-r-available-us-222137792.html"><ins>call a sales representative to buy one</ins></a>. Now all that’s in between you and the company&#39;s futuristic TV is an “Add to Cart” button and about the cost of a down payment on a house in the Bay Area.</p><p>For that amount of money, you get a 65-inch 4K TV that can take on different viewing positions. In its signature “Line View” mode, only part of the OLED R is visible to display the time, weather and other bits of information. It’s also possible to lower the display to do away with letterboxing when watching a movie. Other features include support for Dolby Vision, AirPlay 2 and HomeKit. And while the panel doesn’t get as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-g1-series-oled-tvs-ces-2021-133053674.html"><ins>bright as LG’s latest G1 sets</ins></a>, it can still output gaming content at 4K and 120Hz.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you’re looking for a more affordable entry into LG’s OLED TV ecosystem, the company’s 2021 lineup starts at a much more approachable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-2021-oled-tv-pricing-c1-g1-a1-151137971.html"><ins>$1,299</ins></a>. Even its mid-tier C1 family won’t set you back as much as the OLED R, with the most expensive variant in that lineup coming in at $5,999.

The company announced that it&#39;s pushing out the third beta of Android 12 today, and it brings features like scrolling screenshots, enhanced auto-rotate and more. For developers, Google said this is the &quot;last beta release before the Platform Stability milestone,&quot; which means they can begin to test their apps for the next platform. Beta 3 will also include the final Android 12 APIs and official SDK.&nbsp;</p><p>Those may not seem obviously impactful for the average user. What will feel more immediately useful are  scrolling screenshots, which Google said will work &quot;out-of-the-box for most apps.&quot; With Beta 3, when you snap an image of your screen, you&#39;ll see a new &quot;Capture more&quot; button. Tap that, and you&#39;ll extend the boundaries of your screenshot to get all the content available, after which you can adjust the crop. Google said it&#39;s &quot;continuing to iterate on scrolling screenshots&quot; and &quot;also working to provide support for a wider variety of content (such as web content),&quot; so it&#39;s possible this version isn&#39;t what you&#39;ll see when Android 12 officially launches.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e49b8330-e422-11eb-bbff-c0081a18321d" alt="Two screenshots showing how the scrolling screenshot feature in the third Android 12 beta will work.

As opposed to relying only on accelerometers/gyroscopes to detect the orientation of your phone, this can make auto-rotate more responsive. It&#39;s &quot;especially helpful for people who are using their devices while lying down on a couch or in bed, for example,&quot; Google said. If you don&#39;t like the idea of your camera being used to see how you&#39;re holding up your phone, it may help to know that the company said the feature lives in its Private Compute Core and the &quot;images are never stored or sent off the device.&quot; Enhanced auto-rotate will be available on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras.html">the Pixel 4</a> and newer Pixel devices.</p><p>If you&#39;re on an older or non-Pixel phone, you&#39;ll also see some improvements. Google said it &quot;optimized the animation and redrawing and added an ML-driven gesture-detection algorithm&quot; that&#39;s reduced the base auto-rotate feature&#39;s latency by 25 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>Another new feature on Beta 3 is platform support for Google&#39;s on-device search engine called AppSearch. It&#39;ll allow developers to offer better search tools in their apps, and also offer them the option of participating in a central index &quot;that&#39;s maintained for the entire system in Android 12 (and later releases).&quot; Those who opt-in to the central index will enable Google to show data from their apps in overall system searches. Developers can also choose to &quot;securely share data with other apps, allowing them to search your app&#39;s data as well as their own.&quot; That means one day, if they decide to enable it, apps like Tinder and Spotify could search data within your Facebook, Twitter or Instagram apps, for example.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/542d42a0-e424-11eb-bfae-276b7526579b" alt="An animation showing how Game Modes will work in Android 12 when the upcoming game dashboard arrives later this year.

Many other features on Beta 3 are also behind-the-scenes, like the new ability for enterprises to set camera and mic restrictions on devices they manage. Android 12&#39;s Game Mode APIs will let developers respond appropriately to different profiles selected by the player, &quot;like better battery life for a long commute, or performance mode to get peak frame rates,&quot; for example. These will be part of an &quot;upcoming game dashboard which provides an overlay experience with quick access to key utilities during gameplay&quot; that will be available on select devices later this year.</p><p>We&#39;re still eagerly awaiting the addition of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-material-you-android-personalized-redesign-182501466.html">the Material You design</a> scheme that Google unveiled at I/O earlier this year, but as Android 12 approaches platform stability and a final release, it looks like most of the features we were expecting are here. If you&#39;re eager to test out this preview and can&#39;t wait for the official launch, you can enroll in Google&#39;s beta program. As always, we must caution that preview software is not guaranteed to be stable and you should back up your data before installing the beta.

That strategy hasn&#39;t always worked out in Vive&#39;s favor — the long-awaited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-17-htc-vive-cosmos-review.html">Cosmos headset was a disappointment </a>— but it probably makes more sense than competing with Facebook&#39;s practically limitless resources head-on.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="73158178-a34e-45b4-b58b-679f8dfba9d2"/><p>Enter the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Vive Focus 3" href="https://fave.co/36Ap6yd">Vive Focus 3</a>, a $1,300 standalone headset that&#39;s really only meant for businesses. Because it costs $1,000 more than the Oculus Quest 2, the Focus 3 unsurprisingly offers better hardware, ergonomics and build quality than Oculus&#39;s headset. It&#39;s the difference between building a device that&#39;s meant to be used throughout the day in professional settings, and something you may use once in a while for gaming. The Vive Focus 3 is meant to get shit done.</p><p>At first glance, the Focus 3 certainly looks more like a premium VR workhorse than the Quest 2. While the Oculus headset has flimsy cloth straps and a minimalist goggle design, the Focus 3 looks like an expensive pair of ski goggles fashioned into a VR device. Its magnesium alloy frame is still technically plastic, but it feels sturdier than the Quest&#39;s flimsy case (HTC Vive claims it’s 20 percent lighter and five times stronger than traditional plastic). As much as I liked the Quest 2, you can instantly feel how much Oculus skimped on its materials to reach that low $299 price.</p><p>While Oculus leaned into the sleek and curvy Apple gadget aesthetic, HTC Vive went for sharper lines and a more elaborate design. The Focus 3&#39;s headstrap, for example, looks far more involved with a plastic frame, tons of cushioning and a rear dial to tighten everything up. It&#39;s also angled around the sides so it never touches your ears, which goes a long way toward making the VR experience feel more comfortable. The rear part of the strap may look chunky, but that&#39;s because it also houses the Focus 3&#39;s battery pack. Putting a bit more junk in the trunk helps to balance its weight, so it&#39;s not leaning down on your nose uncomfortably like some earlier VR headsets. (The Quest 2&#39;s Elite Strap and rear battery pack offers a similarly balanced feel, so the Focus 3&#39;s design isn&#39;t completely innovative.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/287a07d0-e4bd-11eb-b5bf-6bb30a5c0665" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="438d8813-5011-3c22-a7bf-034ac2c5d1c3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Focus 3&#39;s battery pack is removable, which allows businesses to keep a single headset running continuously throughout the day. One downside to this unique battery design is that the Focus 3 charges via a proprietary AC adapter, despite having a USB-C port. As a concession, the company includes a dual USB-C cable that connects to the headset and can charge both controllers simultaneously. Your desk may end up looking like a sea of cables, but at least you can make sure all your VR gear is charged.</p><p>While its design shows just how much HTC Vive has learned over the years, it&#39;s what&#39;s under the hood that  makes the Focus 3 special. It&#39;s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR 2 chip, similar to the Quest 2, but it&#39;s also running at a higher clock speed. (To get faster and more consistent performance, HTC Vive also squeezed in a heat pipe and cooling fan at the front of the headset.) The Focus 3&#39;s displays offer  5K resolution (4,896 by 2,448 pixels), a smooth 90Hz refresh rate and a wide 120-degree field of view. In comparison, the Quest 2&#39;s screen is close to 4K and has an estimated 90- to 100-degree field of view (depending on where you position the lenses). Both headsets offer LCDs with RGB sub-pixels, which offers a boost in sharpness and clarity compared to PenTile OLED screens from earlier models.</p><section data-eng-breakout="51c9a03763514f32af2d865c6712fcc8" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878cf51-e4bd-11eb-a7f7-6ee800969b6e" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3"></section><p>As far as VR technology goes, the Focus 3 has just about everything you&#39;d want in a modern headset. But there are simple, less technical upgrades that I appreciated too, like its support for large 150mm-wide glasses. It usually takes a bit of effort for me to squeeze a headset over my frames, and they inevitably get yanked out whenever I step out of VR. But I never had to deal with that on the Focus 3, thanks to its roomy interior. There&#39;s also an IPD adjustment dial to help you fine-tune exactly how its lenses hit your eyes; the Quest 2 only gives you a few options to adjust IPD. The elaborate padding around the front and rear also goes a long way toward making you forget you&#39;re even wearing a VR headset.</p><p>Even the Focus 3&#39;s controllers are better than anything we&#39;ve seen from HTC Vive before. They look similar to Oculus&#39;s, with a round tracking ring, face buttons, as well as the standard grip and trigger buttons. Clearly, they&#39;re light years beyond the enormous controllers that the original HTC Vive came with. Still, Oculus has the edge when it comes to overall ergonomics. The Quest 2&#39;s gamepads are contoured to better fit your hands, especially during fast-paced games. Holding the Focus 3&#39;s controllers, meanwhile, feels more awkward during lengthy VR sessions.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2877bde0-e4bd-11eb-9b55-e06a17df7af6" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="c1d6ea36-a10d-30ce-bf0a-020b519c5977"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Thankfully, though, the headset itself is comfortable to wear for hours at a time, and it delivers the most immersive standalone virtual reality experiences I&#39;ve seen yet. I wandered the Louvre in <em>Mona Lisa Beyond the Glass</em>, which let me get inches away from several classic da Vinci paintings. If I tried to do that in real life, I&#39;m sure some security guards would swiftly kick me out. But in VR, I could admire the detail in every work of art. I was also surprised just how great everything looked in the Focus 3. There was more detail than in any Quest 2 experience I&#39;ve seen, and the large field of view genuinely made me feel like I was walking through the Louvre&#39;s ornate halls, instead of just peering in through a pair of VR binoculars.</p><p>Similarly, I had a genuine sense of walking through meadows and tropical beaches in the Nature Treks VR experience. The Focus 3&#39;s sharp display once again shined when I peered at statues and wildlife up close, but the detail was limited by its mobile hardware. 360-degree YouTube videos also looked fantastic when I fired them up in Firefox VR, but the experience can be hit or miss depending on the quality of the source. And even though the headset doesn&#39;t have beefy near-field speakers like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html">Valve Index</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-reverb-g2-review-vr-windows-mixed-reality-130012057.html">HP Reverb G2</a> .</p><p>I was surprised that the Focus 3 didn&#39;t include any sort of built-in multimedia app for watching VR videos, but that really underscores one of its biggest problems: The Focus 3 has a far more limited software library than the Quest. While Oculus has pushed for high-profile exclusives and popular games, like <em>Vader Immortal </em>and <em>Beat Saber</em>, the HTC VivePort store feel practically anemic. There are a handful of shared titles across both platforms, like <em>Last Labyrinth </em>and <em>Tokyo Chronos</em>, but it&#39;s clear they aren&#39;t a big focus for HTC Vive.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878cf50-e4bd-11eb-aff7-e549ecbc5902" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="e1dc6f3a-73d9-3135-bf39-46d874ce91a8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>At this point, even installing new experiences is more of a pain on the Focus 3, since you need to take off the headset to purchase apps and games from your web browser. Meanwhile, the Quest and Quest 2 let you buy things from within the headset and a mobile app. But I suppose that&#39;s not a huge problem for HTC Vive, since the Focus 3 isn&#39;t meant for consumers at all. Instead, IT departments will likely preload the software their workers actually need. (There&#39;s also going to be a Vive Business App Store eventually, though it&#39;s unclear if that will offer a better purchasing experience.)</p><p>That&#39;s one reason why we&#39;re not scoring this review. This $1,300 headset isn&#39;t meant to be consumer friendly. And honestly, I couldn&#39;t even test some of the more popular business apps, like Vive Sync&#39;s virtual collaboration tool and Engage&#39;s event app. HTC Vive&#39;s previous Focus headsets also gained a reputation for being easy ways to train employees using apps like Virti. And while that app certainly looks cool in the Focus 3, I can&#39;t exactly tell if it&#39;s offering effective training or not.</p><p>There are also features I haven&#39;t been able to effectively test out. The Focus 3 offers Vive Business Streaming, which lets you connect the headset to a VR PC over a USB 3.2 cable or Wi-Fi. But it&#39;s apparently very picky, as none of the USB cables I used were even recognized by the software (and some would just throw an error saying they weren&#39;t USB 3.0 capable, even though I <em>knew</em> they were). You can also stream PC VR over Wi-Fi, but that only works if your computer is connected directly to your router over Ethernet, and if you have a strong wireless connection with the headset. That just wasn&#39;t possible in my basement office. I&#39;m hoping HTC Vive works out its connection requirements, especially since Oculus Link on the Quest is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-link-widens-usb-support-214755370.html">far less demanding when it comes to cables</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878cf52-e4bd-11eb-9f1e-95f11c8315bd" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="4cc1f931-735c-36f0-aef4-ac30ca6bb200"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>No matter how you cut it, the Quest 2 is still the standalone VR headset most consumers should buy. But the Focus 3 is perfect for businesses looking for something a bit more sturdy and powerful. For them, a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,300 device" href="https://fave.co/36Ap6yd">$1,300 device</a> makes more sense than investing tens of thousands on more elaborate training tools.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e3f0095e-5d29-4018-a4be-5a62774d660e</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 16:30:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626285927</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T18:05:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878f661-e4bd-11eb-b7bb-d183f7158f02" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878f661-e4bd-11eb-b7bb-d183f7158f02" width="2000" height="1114" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Focus 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook wants the FTC's tech-critic chair to step back from antitrust decisions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon isn&#39;t the only one asking for Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ftc-chair-lina-khan-recusal-antitrust-investigations-181556108.html">step away from cases</a>.

And there are three display choices: you can get it with a 120Hz 4K HDR 400 nit touch display for content creation (with the 16GB VRAM RTX 3080 configuration), a 360Hz 1080p display for the fastest gaming possible, or a 240Hz 2,560 x 1,440 display for a blend of the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Other specs include 32GB of 3,200 MHz Dual-Channel DDR4 RAM (upgradeable to 64GB), up to a 4TB NVMe SSD (with an open M.2 slot) and numerous ports: Two Thunderbolt 4 ports (USB-C 3.2 Gen2), three USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type A ports, HDMI 2.1 and a UHS-III SD card reader. It also comes with WiFi6, a 1080p webcam with Windows Hello IR, THX spatial audio support, a 4-mic array and a 70.5 WHr battery.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/68cdb1e0-e4b0-11eb-b5eb-c0b1c228fdb8" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Razer unveils its latest Blade 17 laptop with 11th-gen Core i9 CPUs" data-uuid="0d3a0f96-5ca0-356a-9631-1896e8f68a13"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>All of that fits in a 6.06 pound squarish body with typical Razer styling that&#39;s relatively slim at 19.9 mm. The Blade 17 is now available for pre-order at $2,400, but you&#39;ll pay up to $3,700 for the 4K display-equipped model with 32GB of RAM and an RTX 3080 with 16GB of DDR6 VRAM.&nbsp;</p><p>The Blade 15 Base (below) is more modestly equipped than either that model or the Blade 15 we saw in May. However, it still has respectable components including Intel&#39;s 8-core i7-11800H processor and up to RTX 3070 8GB graphics. It also comes with either a 144Hz 1080p IPS, THX certified display or a 165Hz QHD display with up to 100 percent DCI-P3 coverage.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a71ec240-e4b0-11eb-be6f-90a7c832e7d9" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Razer unveils its latest Blade 17 laptop with 11th-gen Core i9 CPUs" data-uuid="61499674-178e-3ebd-ae70-9dbc64c8680f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>Other features on the Blade 15 Base include a single Thunderbolt 4 port (USB-C), three USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, HDMI 2.1 and Gigabit ethernet. That&#39;s a bit of a letdown from the Blade 15 advanced, which has an extra Thunderbolt port and an SD UHS III card reader. However, you&#39;ll also pay considerably less, as the Blade 15 Base starts at $1,800, compared to the $2,300 starting price of the Blade Advanced.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-17-11th-gen-intel-core-i9-cpu-150043505.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5945142-c5e0-4ff3-ae2c-0faefad60571</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626274822</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T15:00:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17d3a920-e4ab-11eb-a1ff-2b89988e1d9c" width="1266" height="827" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17d3a920-e4ab-11eb-a1ff-2b89988e1d9c" width="1266" height="827" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Razer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Razer unveils its latest Blade 17 laptop with 11th-gen Core i9 CPUs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer unveils its latest Blade 17 laptop with 11th-gen Core i9 CPUs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft unveils Windows 365, a Windows 10 PC in the cloud]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Windows 365, a new service announced today at the Microsoft Inspire conference, is basically an unintentional riff on the Yo Dawg meme: Microsoft put Windows in the cloud so you can run a Windows computer while you&#39;re running your computer. You can just <a href="https://microsoft.com/Windows-365">call it a Cloud PC</a>, as Microsoft does. It&#39;s basically an easy-to-use virtual machine that lets you hop into your own Windows 10 (and eventually Windows 11) installation on any device, be it a Mac, iPad, Linux device or Android tablet. Xzibit would be proud.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d547ab00-e4a6-11eb-95dd-74878b12b284" alt="Windows 365" data-uuid="487b70ae-02f6-32ac-b74d-55ce57dcace3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>While Windows 365 doesn&#39;t come completely out of nowhere — rumors about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-cloud-pc-service-release-date-report-181551713.html">some kind of Microsoft cloud PC effort </a>have been swirling for months — its full scope is still surprising. It builds on Microsoft&#39;s Azure Virtual Desktop service, which lets tech-savvy folks also spin up their own virtual PCs, but it makes the entire process of managing a Windows installation in a far-off server far simpler. You just need to head to <a href="http://www.Microsoft.com/Windows-365">Windows365.com</a> when it launches on August 2nd (that domain isn&#39;t yet live), choose a virtual machine configuration, and you&#39;ll be up and running. (Unfortunately, we don&#39;t yet know how much the service is going to cost, but Microsoft says it will reveal final pricing on August 1st.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Windows 365 likely isn&#39;t going to mean much for most consumers, but it could be life-changing for IT departments and small businesses. Now, instead of managing local Windows installations on pricey notebooks, IT folks can get by with simpler hardware that taps into a scalable cloud. Windows 365 installations will be configurable with up to eight virtual CPUs, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage at the time of launch. Microsoft is also exploring ways to bring in dedicated GPU power for more demanding users, Scott Manchester, the director of Program Management for Windows 365, tells us.</p><p>Smaller businesses, meanwhile, could set up Windows 365 instances for their handful of employees to use on shared devices. And instead of lugging a work device home, every Windows 365 user can securely hop back into their virtual desktops from their home PCs or tablets via the web or Microsoft&#39;s Remote Desktop app. During a brief demo of Windows 365, running apps and browsing the web didn&#39;t seem that different than a local PC. It&#39;s also fast enough to stream video without any noticeable artifacts, Manchester says. (Microsoft is also using technology that can render streaming video on a local machine, which it eventually passes over to your Cloud PC.) You&#39;ll also be able to roll back your Cloud PC to previous states, which should be helpful if you ever accidentally delete important files.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d552ce90-e4a6-11eb-bf69-abc54a65a501" alt="Windows 365" data-uuid="45ae57cc-2679-3d37-90f0-f0a13cb947d9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>While the idea for Windows 365 came long before the pandemic, Microsoft workers spent the last year learning first-hand how useful a Cloud PC could be. They used a tool meant for hybrid work — where you can easily switch between working in an office or remotely — while stuck at home during the pandemic.</p><p>But why develop Windows 365 when Azure Virtual Desktop already exists? Manchester tells us that Microsoft noticed a whopping 80 percent of AVD customers were relying on third-party vendors to help manage their installations. &quot;Ultimately, they were looking for Microsoft to be a one-stop-shop for them to get all the services they need to,&quot; he said said.</p><p>That statistic isn&#39;t very surprising. Virtualizing operating systems has been a useful local tool for developers over the last few decades, but it&#39;s typically been a bit too difficult for mainstream users to manage on their own. And even though a tool like Azure Virtual Desktop brought it to the cloud (Manchester assures us that&#39;s not going anywhere either), it&#39;s even more difficult to manage.&nbsp;</p><p>One thing Windows 365 doesn&#39;t mean, at least at this point, is the end of traditional computers. &quot;I think we&#39;ll still continue to have great client PC experiences,&quot; said Melissa Grant, director of Product Marketing for Windows 365, in an interview. &quot;You know we have a relationship with our laptops. It is our sort of home and hub for our computing experience. What we want to offer with Windows 365 is the ability to have that same familiar and consistent Windows experience across other devices.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-365-cloud-virtual-pc-150022333.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce821c63-d2a7-4c2f-a812-7e93dcc091df</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 15:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626325063</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T04:57:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d547d210-e4a6-11eb-affc-b75be7d25631" width="960" height="600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d547d210-e4a6-11eb-affc-b75be7d25631" width="960" height="600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 365]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 365]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox family app now lets parents set spending limits]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t have to worry about your kids going on a game shopping spree, at least if you&#39;re part of a Windows or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-review-microsoft-140045437.html">Xbox household</a>.

That depends on who you ask. PUIG’s perfumiers, who produce scents for Paco Rabanne, believe that the future smells sexy, confident and energetic. That’s how they’re choosing to market Phantom, the fashion house’s latest fragrance-cum-piece of retro-futurist art. Phantom comes in a robot-shaped bottle that, when you tap your phone on the NFC tag embedded into its head, welcomes you into its own digital world. Digital trinkets on offer will include interactive filters, personalized playlists, augmented reality filters and more.</p><p>Paco Rabanne is the nom de guerre of Spanish designer Francisco Rabaneda Cuervo, who in the ‘60s was a pioneering figure in the fashion world. Both he, and the house that bears his name, has had an appreciation for the absurdity of science fiction. Rabanne began producing dresses with metal and plastic, glued, or stitched together with wire, rather than sewing. His couture work graces pretty much every retrospective of ‘60s fashion and, far more than his contemporaries, embodies the “space age” fashion of the era.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Phantom is intended as a love letter to that history, with retro-futurist design that wouldn’t have looked out of place in <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/ffc/2016/00000005/00000002/art00004;jsessionid=xupeous88n0h.x-ic-live-02"><em>Barbarella</em></a>. The bottle is heavy, with the traditional lower-case “pr” logo in its torso, with the outline of the “p” made out of glass. That lets you watch the water line fall as you spritz yourself every morning with the scent. It comes in two sizes: 100ml (which I’ve seen and used) and 150ml, only the latter of which is refillable.</p><p>Of course, Phantom isn’t just a fancy bottle, but the key to a whole online world of digital goodies. The top of its bottle houses an NFC chip that, when tapped, welcomes the owner’s smartphone to a list of digital trinkets as a reward for buying the bottle. At the time of writing, only two items are available, but the company says that the list of items will grow over time, as outlined above.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/10afed80-d8d9-11eb-bbfb-7f2ad7fda973" alt="Image of the NFC tag at the top of the Paco Rabanne Phantom bottle." data-uuid="7e5205d9-f01d-362a-b937-1331aabf5e91"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>First up, Boombot lets you pick a date to get a Spotify “playlist of bangers that were number one on that day.” Upon closer analysis, it looks like it’s limited to the US charts, but you’ll be able to open the playlist in Spotify and groove to half a century of tunes. It’s a feature that you’ll be familiar with if you’ve ever used a website like <a href="https://mybirthdayhits.com/">MyBirthdayHits</a>, which looks a little less beautiful but does a very similar job.</p><p>Second and for now last, is an exclusive Instagram filter called Paco Rabanne’s Phantom Philter. This sees a tiny AR version of the bottle sit on your shoulder, fly around your head or tell someone that it loves them, its eyes and head motion are synched to yours, too. And it’s fun, fun enough for at least one selfie with the little cartoon.</p><p>But the sci-fi isn’t just in the clothes that Phantom is wearing, but in how the fragrance was created in the first place. Perfumiers worked in collaboration with an AI that helped them explore new possibilities in crafting the scent. According to the company, the team conceived of a new smell, and then programmed the formula into an AI, which ran through a series of as-yet untried combinations to make reactions to the smell more intense.</p><p>In Phantom’s case, perfumier Loc Dong wanted to try and “over-dose” a molecule called styrallyl acetate. When he suggested this to the computer, it recommended that Dong use “ten times the usual amount,” compared to a modern perfume. Similarly, the lavender used in the fragrance was sourced through “molecular distillation” which produces a “very modern lavender note.”</p><p>In a statement, Paco Rabane added that the fragrance was tested on men aged 18-35, to determine how it made them feel. They said that Phantom made them feel “sexiness,” “alertness” and “energy,” although the specifics on that testing is a little loose.</p><p>Now, I’m no perfume reviewer, a job that I’ll leave to the vastly more qualified people over at Fragrantica. (Who knew that people could sniff a scent and wish that the designers had added more Bergamot?) I would describe Phantom as a sweet musk, one that even hours after applying, felt strong and persistent. It’s certainly a more energetic smell than the one I’m used to — my aftershave of choice is Chanel Allure Homme Sport — and felt more productive as a consequence. In fact, Phantom is a strong scent but not an unpleasant or overpowering one, and everyone who, in these COVID-sensitive times, I’ve invited to sniff me seemed to agree.</p><p>All in all, it smells pretty good.</p><p>I don’t know if the digital goodies on offer will be a compelling draw here, at least not on current evidence. Maybe this is for those menswear influencers I see all the damn time on Instagram, even if they’re more commonly repping YSL and Celine. Perhaps a little AR robot, sitting on their shoulder while they smoke and drink coffee, reclining on a Paris park bench, is what they need to bolster their effortful laid back cool. But, fundamentally, you’re going to buy this thing because it smells nice, not because you get a free Instagram filter… right?</p><p>Phantom by Paco Rabanne is launching on August 1st, 2021, and will be available in the US at Macy’s, Nordstrom’s, Dillard’s and Sephora. No word, yet, on how much the 100ml bottle will cost, but the 150ml edition will set you back $125, while the 200ml refill is priced at $130.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/paco-rabanne-nfc-fragrance-robot-bottle-140040817.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2c7d3c57-a6e7-413b-8eb8-c88314b72cbf</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 14:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626265128</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T12:19:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Fragrances]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f8dd2470-d8d8-11eb-b3bf-51a2be774fe6" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f8dd2470-d8d8-11eb-b3bf-51a2be774fe6" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the phantom bottle.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Phantom]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon scraps plan for a Joe Exotic drama starring Nicolas Cage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t get your hopes up for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-tiger-king-nicolas-cage-095517875.html">Amazon&#39;s take on <em>Tiger King</em>&#39;s Joe Exotic</a>. <em>Variety</em> has <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/nicolas-cage-joe-exotic-amazon-series-1235019225/">learned</a> from would-be show star Nicolas Cage that Amazon has scrapped the series.

Amazon might not have been keen to advertise for Netflix, even if its own series garnered critical acclaim.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-cancels-joe-exotic-nicolas-cage-show-132737285.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d3f1b935-7bbb-4a9c-be72-ab928ecb2471</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:27:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626269261</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T13:27:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c8cdf320-e4a1-11eb-a5df-8279d1ebe88d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c8cdf320-e4a1-11eb-a5df-8279d1ebe88d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Joe Exotic in Netflix documentary 'Tiger King']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Joe Exotic in Netflix documentary 'Tiger King']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple brings its free tutorials to YouTube]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since 2017, all of Apple&#39;s retail stores have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-25-apple-store-redesign-and-workshops.html">offered Today At Apple sessions</a>, free workshops where you can learn, among other things, how to get the most out of the company&#39;s devices and software. In 2020, necessitated by the pandemic, Apple started offering those tutorials online, hosting the sessions over Cisco Webex. Starting today, the company is making Today at Apple tutorials available on YouTube.</p><div id="caf099fe87e64df58f527c3537ba8115"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b0nWcBVvhd0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The first one will teach you how to draw yourself as a Peanuts character in Pages. Krista Porter, a storyboard artist on <em>The Snoopy Show</em>, leads the nearly 10-minute long tutorial alongside Anthony, a creative pro at Apple&#39;s Carnegie Library location in Washington DC. Showrunner Mark Evestaff also makes an appearance in the video to talk about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-reduced-july-1-105546762.html">Apple TV+</a> exclusive. We&#39;ll have to see how later episodes shape up, but at least in its current YouTube form, Today at Apple is as much a workshop series as it is a product advertisement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That&#39;s not surprising. Today at Apple has had that <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/13/today-at-apple-ted-lasso-fan-art/">slant for a while</a>, but it&#39;s only one facet of the program as a whole. The move to YouTube also means the sessions don&#39;t function as a workshop where you can ask the instructor to clarify a point. So it&#39;s best to think of the program&#39;s YouTube availability as a way for the company to show people who might know about Today at Apple that it exists. Apple says it will upload more Today at Apple sessions to YouTube in the future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/today-at-apple-youtube-130046204.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7da2c152-8cf1-45d9-989c-9c7a6f75a10b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:00:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626273546</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T14:39:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/359dc9e0-e497-11eb-bbef-2cb7fea1b072" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/359dc9e0-e497-11eb-bbef-2cb7fea1b072" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Today at Apple]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Today at Apple]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix will tell parents what their kids are watching in biweekly emails]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its latest push to court families, Netflix is launching two new features that highlight its children&#39;s programming. Starting today, subscribers will see a new top 10 list on kids and family profiles that ranks the streamer&#39;s most popular children&#39;s shows and movies. Netflix says the leaderboard will be updated daily to reflect what its 208 million customers are watching in 93 countries across the globe. Viewers can access the top 10 in the kids homepage or in the ‘New &amp; Popular’ section in the menu bar across devices, barring Apple TV.</p><p>To help parents keep track of what their children are watching, Netflix is also sending out a biweekly email newsletter crammed with recommendations based on kids&#39; viewing habits, including the their thematic preferences (like science or friendship shows), and tips on the streamer&#39;s parental controls. That will land in the inbox of parents who have a kids profile set up starting July 16th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The features arrive as Netflix ramps up its kids&#39; content in the face of stiff competition from streaming rivals. On Tuesday, the company extended its US licensing deal for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-exclusive-rights-universal-animated-films-105446842.html">Universal&#39;s animated film slate</a>, giving it access to Illumination and Dreamworks movies such as <em>Minions: The Rise of Gru</em>. In addition, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-13/netflix-and-cocomelon-are-teaming-up-for-more-youtube-style-programming"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>revealed that the streamer had struck a partnership with Moonbug Entertainment for new shows based on its popular YouTube properties CoComelon, Blippi and Little Baby Bum.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix&#39;s recent high-profile kids releases include a cooking show starring Michelle Obama titled <em>Waffles + Mochi </em>and the Lord and Miller produced animated movie <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflixs-the-mitchells-vs-the-machines-animated-comedy-arrives-april-30th-110511249.html"><em>The Mitchells vs the Machines</em></a>. In the past, the streaming service has used<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-20-netflix-interactive-shows.html">interactive shows</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-netflix-acquires-storybots.html">IP acquisitions</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-22-netflix-unveils-new-shows-aimed-at-preschoolers.html">series aimed at preschoolers</a> to keep families coming back.</p><p>The competition has also seized upon kids content as a means of attracting subscribers. Earlier this year, HBO Max <a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/ca/media-release/hbo-max/warnermedia-expands-kids-family-offerings-cartoon-network-and-hbo-max-under-new">ordered</a> a raft of new Cartoon Network shows, bumping up its slate to 300 hours of children&#39;s originals and 3,000 hours of library programming. Disney, meanwhile, has unloaded its vault of cherished family classics onto Disney+, along with Pixar exclusives and spinoffs such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-pixar-luca-review-160036700.html"><em>Luca</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-monsters-inc-series-disney-plus.html"><em>Monsters at Work</em></a><em>. </em>Paramount+ also just announced a <a href="https://www.avclub.com/paramount-plus-is-making-a-new-live-action-fairly-oddpa-1847277976"><em>Fairly OddParents</em></a> live-action reboot to add to its Nickelodeon line-up.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-parents-kids-emails-130039358.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e4badaa-080d-46b3-b494-d3d040fd589c</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 13:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626271290</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T14:01:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f33d8f50-e495-11eb-bedf-4212278b42f4" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f33d8f50-e495-11eb-bedf-4212278b42f4" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
