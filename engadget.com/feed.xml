Made up of employees who work together to <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-moments-guidelines-and-principles">contextualize some of the most popular topics</a> people are discussing on Twitter, the curation team oversees some of the platform’s more visible and sometimes controversial features, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-explains-trending-topics-pinned-tweets-173023064.html">Trends</a> and the Explore tab.</p><p>As a Twitter user, the company says you can expect to see it work faster to ensure there’s more and better contextual information to see as people discuss things on the service. As a starting point on that front, the company says Trends will include contextual descriptions and links to reporting from reputable publications more frequently. Additionally, the company says the program will help it proactively identify topics that could become a wellspring of misinformation. “Rather than waiting until something goes viral, Twitter will contextualize developing discourse at pace with or in anticipation of the public conversation,” the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter also expects the partnership will help some features, where context is vitally important, work better. Here, the company points to tools like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-birdwatch-misinformation-182940288.html">Birdwatch</a>. Initially, <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Reuters</em> will focus on helping the company with English-language content, but it’s worth noting the curation team contextualizes Japanese, Arabic, Spanish and Portuguese content as well.</p><p>In trying to support its curation team better, Twitter wants to avoid a repeat of a situation like the one it found itself in last year following the death of Jeffrey Epstein. The social media network was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/2/21413001/twitter-trends-labels-representative-tweets-conspiracies-misinformation">overrun with conspiracy theories about Epstein’s suicide</a>, and the company was seemingly unable to stop hashtags like #ClintonBodyCount from trending. Even when you take blatant disinformation out of the picture, Twitter trends are frequently easy bait for trolling, as was on display when US gymnast Simone Biles <a href="https://warzel.substack.com/p/the-simon-biles-culture-war-traveled">withdrew from the Tokyo Olympics</a>. While trolls are likely to continue trying to game the service, enlisting the help of <em>The Associated Press</em> and <em>Reuters</em> could make those efforts less visible</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-associated-press-reuters-curation-partnership-213918911.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">21e19397-6bc4-42de-918e-29a601821f1e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 21:39:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627940363</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T21:39:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-07/48f2d580-ca80-11ea-bdba-d75a60d73deb" width="3500" height="2181" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-07/48f2d580-ca80-11ea-bdba-d75a60d73deb" width="3500" height="2181" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Men are silhouetted against a video screen with a Twitter logo as he poses with a Samsung S4 smartphone in this photo illustration taken in the central Bosnian town of Zenica, August 14, 2013.

Spotted by <a href="https://www.aftvnews.com/amazon-announces-smart-soap-dispenser-that-can-automatically-trigger-alexa-routines/"><em>AFTVnews</em></a>, the gadget includes a set of 10 LED lights that will count down as you wash your hands for the 20 seconds recommended by the CDC to keep germs and harmful bacteria away.</p><p>As an Alexa Gadget, you can also pair the Smart Soap Dispenser with a compatible Echo device to access a supporting Alexa Routine that will play your favorite song or tell you a joke or fun fact while you scrub away. That’s an optional feature and the dispenser itself doesn’t include a microphone or speaker. You also don’t need an Echo device to access its best gimmick. Depending on how far underneath the nozzle you hold your hand, the device will provide you with more or less soap from its 12-ounce reservoir. The closer you place your handle to the nozzle, the less soap it will dispense.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Outside of those features, the Smart Soap Dispenser comes with 802.11n WiFi connectivity like 2009 never came and went, and a micro-USB port (shudder) for when you need to charge the device. Amazon says the internal battery can last about three months on a single charge.</p><p>At $54.99, the Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser is significantly more expensive than many of the “dumb” automatic soap dispensers you can buy, including a lot of the ones you’ll find on Amazon’s own marketplace. It also feels like it’s a year late. Many tech companies added hand washing-related <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wear-os-wash-hands-reminder-021849975.html">features last year</a>, and the latest science suggests the coronavirus <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00251-4">rarely spreads on surfaces</a>. All the same, you can pre-order the Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser starting today, with orders expected to ship on August 4th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-smart-soap-dispenser-200025903.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">31f4ec8a-030d-4dee-b1e8-102ebc671236</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 20:00:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627937847</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T20:57:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8cf8efc0-f3ca-11eb-affd-501e01fb0a46" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8cf8efc0-f3ca-11eb-affd-501e01fb0a46" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Smart Soap Dispenser]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Lord of the Rings series arrives on September 2, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s long-awaited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/lord%20of%20the%20rings">The Lord of the Rings</a> series has a release date, but don&#39;t go rushing to stake out the best spot in your living room just yet.

The Containment event features a new game mode called Nest Destruction, in which you&#39;ll attempt to destroy or defend an alien nest on a revamped version of the Consulate map.</p><div id="b686d1166d594773b949837aef139a95"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OEhzh2YY8C8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The attackers play as a team of REACT agents who are tasked with destroying nests. They&#39;ll square off against &quot;a team of Proteans, a deadly Archæan variant that can adopt the form of REACT operators,&quot; Ubisoft said. These creatures can mimic the behavior of operators and they&#39;ll move fast, but they can only use melee attacks, such as Aruni’s punch and <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/rainbow-six/siege/game-info/operators/oryx"><ins>Oryx’s</ins></a> special abilities. The attacking team can only use a standard loadout with no modifiers, and there&#39;s a limited roster of operators. Along with successfully destroying or defending the nest, teams can win by wiping out their opponents.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The event sounds intriguing, but the timing of it is slightly odd. The mode was inspired by <em>R6 Extraction,</em> which was supposed to arrive in September. Last month, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-delays-rainbow-six-extraction-riders-republic-172418599.html"><ins>pushed back</ins></a> the release date to January.

Between August 13th and 15th, <em>R6 Siege </em>will be free to play, so anyone can hop in and check out the event.

Even companies like Modal Electronics, which typically trafficked in higher-end instruments that started at around $2,000, suddenly felt pressure to compete in the sub-$300 range. First it dabbled with two simplistic DIY kits: the CraftSynth and CraftRhythms. But then in 2018 it brought the Skulpt to Kickstarter, followed shortly thereafter by the $149 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-02-modal-electronics-craftsynth-2-0-hands-on-demo-portable-music.html">CraftSynth 2.0</a>. These were much more serious shots at the entry level. But where both impressed with their sound, the build quality was poor and the original Skulpt was a little overpriced at $299.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-affordable-portable-synthesizer-mpe-100523052.html">SkulptSynth SE</a> attempts to address those concerns. It’s quite a bit cheaper at just <a href="https://fave.co/3l5Z1zn">$199</a>, putting it more in line with the Volcas, and the build quality is sturdier, too. But under the hood it’s largely the same instrument, and the question is whether it’s as compelling now as it was three years ago.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Alright, I won’t make you wait: The answer is yes. The Skulpt sounds great. Sure, plenty of other synths have come and gone over the last three years, especially at the cheaper end of the spectrum, but that doesn’t take away from the excellent virtual analog engine here. There’s a total of 32 oscillators stacked in four voices (though using the spread function you can expand that to 16) with two different waves per voice. This gives the Skulpt a thick tone that, while you probably won’t mistake it for true analog, is still plenty inviting. While it&#39;s perfectly capable of handling basslines and lead duty, the Skulpt really shines when it comes to pads where those stacked oscillators really flesh out the sound.</p><p>The Skulpt has a wealth of modulation options, too, that give it a surprising amount of depth for something so small and cheap. There are dedicated filter and amp envelopes, but also a mod envelope and a pair of LFOs, one of which is polyphonic. Those last three can be assigned to a host of different destinations, with a total of eight modulation slots available. In addition, there’s ring modulation, FM and pulse width modulation options, plus a morphing filter that goes from lowpass, to bandpass then highpass, not to mention built-in delay and distortion effects. There are far more sound design tools here than you’d have any right to expect for $200.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db64c40-f3a4-11eb-aaf7-3621e0a8d368" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="c27a8af5-d3bb-3a6d-aec6-dedc56b7aafe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The wealth options are great, but actually navigating those controls is a bit difficult. The unit comes with a cheat sheet and you’ll always want it on hand. While the front plate has simpler, less confusing graphics than the original Skulpt, the SE still isn’t exactly intuitive. While there are lines that show you what controls are connected to each other, they’re not laid out in any sort of obviously logical way. And the tiny orange and white text labels feel crowded and hard to read at times. While the layout is visually interesting, it’s also infuriating. This a place where form clearly won out over function, and not for the better.</p><p>Another thing that’s improved on the SE is the build quality. But, just like the panel design, it’s not as huge an upgrade as you might hope. The knobs feel a little firmer and have slightly more resistance than on the Craft 2, but they’re still pretty wobbly and cheap. At least they don’t slide right off the encoders with a gentle tug, though.</p><div id="e32890c2287b4b83b55bc683b7b28c5e"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1098737245%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-B0LetHEZU7a&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size:10px;color:#cccccc;overflow:hidden;white-space:nowrap;font-family:Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-weight:100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast" title="Engadget" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Engadget</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-sound-samples/s-B0LetHEZU7a" title="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE sound samples" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE sound samples</a></div></div><p>I’m not sure how much better the overall build is than the original Skulpt, and it’s only marginally better than the Craft 2. In general, the Skulpt SE still feels chintzy. But it does come with a cover that will help protect it in a bag, which is more than I can say for the Craft. Sadly, though, the touch keyboard is as bad as ever. It’s not always super responsive and the layout somehow manages to feel both cramped and sprawling all at the same time. Playing simple triads required an uncomfortable amount of stretching and I could rarely play a chord progression without accidentally triggering at least one stray note. Volca keyboards are certainly nothing to get excited about, but they make the Modal touchstrips feel like cheap imposters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db0a6f0-f3a4-11eb-9efc-9043541d6567" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="a5c9ec23-5bc7-38bd-a7d2-752d30e18809"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>One final gripe about the physical design: The Skulpt has full-sized MIDI in and out ports, but a 3.5mm lineout jack. While full-size MIDI DINs are appreciated, I’d rather see ¼-inch audio outs and smaller TRS MIDI jacks if I had to choose. And honestly, on something that’s battery powered and portable, TRS MIDI just makes more sense. Save the space.</p><p>A lot of my complaints about the interface and unimpressive build quality can be ignored though if you just use the app. Stick the Skulpt someplace out of the way and connect it to your computer or phone over USB and you’re set. Then you can control it via MIDI over USB and do all your patching from within the Modal app. It’s much easier than using the device itself. It even has a VST version so you can control the Skulpt from your DAW, but I had some issues getting it running on my Windows PC.</p><section data-eng-breakout="19fd7110f0864e86ac1322de738befc1" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b027e4d0-f3a5-11eb-adfb-393619633cd2" alt="Modal App" data-uuid="04e7bad0-fb33-3f6c-9b6d-fc2a1a26c471"></section><p>The Skulpt is usable without the app, unlike the Craft 2. But honestly, this is probably the way you want to use the Skulpt anyway. While the whole battery-powered portable thing is nice, what’s more exciting is its support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mpe">MPE</a>, which is basically unheard of at this price point. But the built-in keys do not support MPE, velocity or aftertouch, you’ll need to use an external controller.</p><p>Having access to aftertouch and polyphonic expression gives the Skulpt much more life. As a digital synth trying to emulate analog it can sound a little cold at times, but the small fluctuations that come with aftertouch and MPE make the synth feel more organic. Just be warned that dialing in MPE controls requires a bit of trial and error (definitely turn down the pitch bend range in the settings).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2daf9580-f3a4-11eb-a5f6-10c98ed41a79" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="37da4d89-4f42-3a2a-bbf8-1f822ecc40e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>This also gives you more room to experiment with your sound design in interesting ways. For example, in one patch I set the mod wheel (sliding your fingers along the Y axis on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-31-sensel-morph-trackpad-review.html">Sensel Morph</a>) to change the wave shape, and aftertouch to control the filter cutoff. Then I could play a chord and slowly slide my fingers up on the highernotes, causing them to fizzle out as the wave morphed from saw to noise, but keep the bass note droning cleanly. And then I could adjust the balance between these two sounds simply by pressing harder or softer on the right keys. This isn’t necessarily groundbreaking, but it’s definitely impressive on a synth that costs just $200.</p><p>This does make me dream of an upgraded CraftSynth, though. As much as I enjoy the Skulpt, I prefer the sonic palette of the wavetable-based Craft a bit more. I’d love to see Modal release a polyphonic version of it that supports MPE. Basically, give us the best of both synths in a single device.</p><section data-eng-breakout="11b589afc1914f54aaf0989fb5f6772a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2daef940-f3a4-11eb-befc-05e1c86e1239" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="50503922-2ef0-3dbf-bd78-6049918c8dee"></section><p>There are so many options out there at the entry level for synths these days it’s hard to say there is one that is best for most people. The Skulpt SE certainly wouldn’t be a bad choice, though. If you’re truly just starting to learn synthesis, something more straightforward like the $150 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-11-korg-announces-volca-analog-synth-series-we-go-eyes-on.html">Volca Keys</a> might be a good option. But it doesn’t have the depth of the Skulpt. If you’re willing to spend a bit more, Arturia’s $350 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-microfreak-v3-firmware-three-new-oscillators-noise-engineering-synthesizer-184459017.html">Microfreak</a> has even more sound design options to get lost in. Plus, it regularly gets new features and sounds. The only issue is it’s even more complicated than the Skulpt, though its controls are much easier to navigate.</p><p>The SkulptSynth SE shows that Modal is serious about playing at the entry level. The company has delivered an excellent sounding instrument with a wealth of features at an impressive price. If it ever figures out how to design an interface that doesn’t make you want to rip your hair out, Korg’s grip on the budget synth market may be in jeopardy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-review-virtual-analog-170031324.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7be78ab-4193-40df-83b1-87569aee60ec</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 17:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627921846</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T16:30:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db11c20-f3a4-11eb-bfcc-694a073493c1" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db11c20-f3a4-11eb-bfcc-694a073493c1" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[8BitDo made a pair of affordable media remotes for the Xbox Series X/S]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Peripheral-maker 8BitDo is best known for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/8-bitdo-pro-2-controller-review-150053234.html">retro-inspired wireless controllers</a>, but for its latest release, the company has come out with a <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/media-remote-for-xbox/">pair of officially licensed media remotes</a> for the Xbox Series X, Series S and Xbox One. Spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605423/8bitdo-media-remote-xbox-series-x-s-one-black-white"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the two remotes cost <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$19.99" href="https://amzn.to/3jhIHJg">$19.99</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$24.99" href="https://amzn.to/3ljwFlu">$24.99</a>, with the more expensive model featuring an additional numpad.

Both include a dedicated Home button, allowing you to use them to wake your Xbox. You&#39;ll also find playback and navigation controls, as well as a set of A, B, X and Y keys for navigating menus. You&#39;ll need two AAA batteries to power the remotes, though both come with a complimentary pair included in the box.

It’s not a mic, but the effect is about the same. Google’s chief of hardware had just shown me a demo of the company’s latest feature: computational processing for video that will debut on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro</a>. The feature was only possible with Google’s own mobile processor, which it’s announcing today.</p><div id="08b1943fd585452284e3cda4e8727351"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1aDjlGNdiQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>He’s understandably proud and excited to share the news. The chip is called Tensor, and it’s the first system-on-chip (SoC) designed by Google. The company has “been at this about five years,” he said, though CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a statement that Tensor “has been four years in the making and builds off of two decades of Google’s computing experience.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That software expertise is something Google has come to be known for. It led the way in computational photography <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-14-google-pixel-night-sight-launch-sample-photos-comparison.html">with its Night Sight mode for low light shots</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-11-google-duplex-ai-tough-questions-answers-now.html">weirded out</a> the world with how successfully its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-google-duplex-ai-phone-call.html">conversational AI Duplex</a> was able to mimic human speech — right down to the “ums and ahs.” Tensor both leverages Google’s machine learning prowess and enables the company to bring AI experiences to smartphones that it couldn’t before.</p><p>Holding a diet Coke in one hand and gesturing animatedly with the other, Osterloh threw around hyperbolic marketing language like “We’re transforming the computing experience” and “It’ll be what we consider to be a pretty dramatic transformation overall.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a6bfa10-f282-11eb-bbdf-ac92842b242f" alt="Six Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro devices laying on a grey surface at various angles, perpendicular to each other." data-uuid="8088beeb-d9d8-3961-b9c9-9f34e121454a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>He’s alluding to Tensor enabling experiences that previous chips (the company’s mostly used Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors in its prior phones) couldn’t deliver. Things like being able to run multiple AI-intensive tasks simultaneously without a phone overheating, or having enough power to apply computational processing to videos as they’re being captured.</p><p>That belief in Tensor’s significance is part of why Google chose to announce it today ahead of the Pixel 6’s actual launch in the fall. The company isn’t giving away all the details about the processor yet, nor is it sharing specific information about its latest flagships now. But “there&#39;s a lot of new stuff here, and we wanted to make sure people had context,” Osterloh said. “We think it’s a really big change, so that’s why we want to start early.”</p><p>Plus, there’s an added benefit. “Information gets out,” Osterloh added. “Nowadays it’s like, stuff leaks.”</p><h2>A new chip design with AI infused</h2><p>Thanks to those leaks, though, we’ve heard plenty of rumors about Google’s efforts to make its <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-readies-its-own-chip-for-future-pixels-chromebooks-e5f8479e-4a38-485c-a264-9ef9cf68908c.html">own mobile processor for a while</a>, under the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-silicon-whitechapel-pixel-6-170200955.html">code name Project Whitechapel</a>. While the company won’t publicly discuss code names, it’s clear that work on Tensor has been going on for a long time.</p><p>The chip’s name is an obvious nod to the company’s open-source platform for machine learning, TensorFlow, Osterloh said, and that should tell you how big a role AI plays in this processor. Though Google isn’t ready to share the full details about Tensor yet, Osterloh did explain that the SoC is an ARM chip designed around a TPU, or Tensor Processing Unit. The mobile chip was co-designed with Google’s AI researchers and the TPU is based on their larger versions in the company’s data centers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/266992b0-f284-11eb-bd19-aa5a81c1ac61" alt="A rendering of Google&#39;s Tensor mobile chip with words on it saying " data-uuid="7f6473b5-534f-39c9-9006-df79555438e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>It’s not just designed to speed up machine learning tasks on your phone, either. Osterloh said they’ve also redesigned the image signal processor, or ISP. Specifically, he said there are a “few points in the ISP where we can actually insert machine learning, which is new.”</p><p>Google also reconstructed the memory architecture to make it easier to access RAM, and allow for data manipulation while processing images. There are also a few places where Osterloh said they’ve directly encoded their image processing algorithms into the hardware. He says this allows Google to do “stuff that was previously impossible to do on standard SoCs,” though he didn’t share specific details on what Tensor now enables that previous SoCs couldn’t.</p><p>Of course, with this being Google’s first mobile chip, Osterloh concedes people might see the company as unproven. Though he did push back by saying, “I think people are pretty aware of Google’s overall capability.”</p><p>It’s natural to wonder if the company can compete in areas like power efficiency and heat management. Osterloh said they’ve designed Tensor to perform some tasks more power efficiently than previous processors they’ve used while staying within a thermal threshold. Similar to existing processors, Osterloh said “the system has a bunch of different subsystems, [and] we can use the most power efficient element of it for the task at hand.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/48a10890-f284-11eb-b597-5fa79b144805" alt="Side view of the peach/gold Pixel 6 Pro." data-uuid="73539ec3-e8f6-3e31-95e3-4c242eef56df"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Though there’s an ongoing global chip shortage, Osterloh is confident that Google can manage demand. “Everyone’s affected by this, no doubt,” he said. “The positive thing about this is it’s under our control, we’re making this and we’re responsible for it. So we think we should be okay.”</p><h2>Why make Tensor?</h2><p>So what can Tensor do that other mobile processors can’t? Google is saving most of the juicy bits for the Pixel 6’s launch in the fall. But, it did offer two examples of areas that would see dramatic improvement: Photography and voice recognition (and processing). At our meeting, Osterloh showed off some demos of new Tensor-enabled features on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, which also gives us our first look at the phones. The handsets feature a distinctive new look and bright color options. They also have a horizontal camera bump that spans the width of the rear, which is “a very intentional part of the design,” Osterloh notes. &quot;We’ve really been known for photography, [so] we wanted to really emphasize this.”</p><p>Google’s upgraded the cameras themselves, but the promised photography improvements aren’t just from optical hardware. Tensor is behind some of it. With previous chips, the company kept running into limits when trying to improve photography on its phones. “These weren’t designed for machine learning, or AI, and certainly not designed to optimize for where Google’s headed,” he said.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/05ad8eb0-f283-11eb-bff7-d139a54bce0d" alt="Three Pixel 6 phones. From left to right, their color schemes are black/black, green/blue and red/peach." data-uuid="21fe90d2-f119-3daa-a3c2-c853a4dee4f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>So where is Google headed? Towards a world <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-15-google-nest-smart-home-fix-plan.html">of “ambient computing,”</a> a vision that Osterloh and many of his colleagues have touted in the past. They see a future where all the devices and sensors we’re surrounded by can communicate with Google (sometimes via the Assistant) or the internet. But Osterloh knows that for most people, the most important device is still going to be the smartphone. “We see the mobile phone as the center of that.”</p><p>So when Google wanted to improve beyond the limits of contemporary processors, it had to do something different. “What we&#39;ve done in the past, when we encountered these kinds of engineering, constraints and technical constraints, is we take on the problem ourselves,” Osterloh said.</p><h2>Upgrading photo and video processing</h2><p>With Tensor, the Pixel 6 can do things like concurrently capture images from two sensors, with the main one recording at normal exposure and the wide-angle running at a much faster shutter speed. Osterloh said the system runs a number of different machine learning models in real time to help figure out stuff about the scene, like whether there’s a face and is the device moving or shaking. The Pixel 6 will then combine all that info and use it to process photos so that if you’re trying to capture a hyperactive puppy or toddler, you’ll be less likely to get a blurry shot.</p><p>Tensor will also let Google perform computationally intensive tasks while you’re shooting video. Osterloh said that in the past the company hasn’t been able to apply a lot of machine learning to video, since it would be too taxing for a phone processor. But “that all changes with Tensor,” he said. One thing they’ve been able to run is an HDRnet model on videos, which drastically improves quality in tricky situations like when the camera is pointing at the sun.</p><p>Osterloh showed me demos of how the Pixel 6 did both these things, including a before-and-after example of a blurry photo of an active child and video comparisons of a campground at sunset. While there was a clear difference, I unfortunately can’t show you the results. Besides, these were controlled demos from Google. I can’t really gauge how impressive and useful these features are until we get to test them in the real world.</p><h2>Improvements in voice and speech</h2><p>I did get to see a more telling preview, though. Osterloh also showed me how voice dictation will work in the Pixel 6 on GBoard. On the upcoming phone, you’ll be able to hit the microphone button in the compose field, narrate your message and use hotwords like “Send” or “Clear” to trigger actions. You can also edit typos via the onscreen keyboard while the mic is still listening for your dictation.</p><p>This all works via a new Speech On Device API, and I was impressed that the system was smart enough to distinguish between when you say “Send” in “I will send the kids to school” versus when you’re telling it to send the message. Osterloh told me the algorithm is looking not just for the hotword but also your tone of voice and delivery before it triggers the action.</p><p>Finally, there are a couple more things that Osterloh showed me: Live Caption with Translate, as well as Android 12’s Material You design. Thanks to Tensor, Android’s Live Caption feature, which provides subtitles for anything playing through your device’s sound system, will be able to translate what’s being said in real time as well. This all happens on device, so the next time you’re watching a foreign-language TED Talk or your favorite international TV show, it won’t matter if they don’t have subtitles — Tensor will provide.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/017c9f10-b8c3-11eb-9d45-51b82cbc3318" alt="Android 12 Beta" data-uuid="1ff5cf9e-bbb9-30db-9806-e6ac39ca0e98"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><h2>A look at Material You</h2><p>Meanwhile, Material You, which Google first unveiled at I/O this year, is what Osterloh called the biggest UI change in Android maybe since the beginning. I’ve been waiting to see the feature in the Android 12 public beta, but it’s still not available there. At our meeting, Osterloh showed me how it works — he changed the wallpaper of a Pixel 6 from something more rosy hued to a scene of a body of water, and the system’s icons and highlights quickly updated to match. App icons were painted to match as well, but something new I learned from this demo was that if you’re like me and prefer your icons to keep their original colors, you can opt to leave them untouched.</p><p>We’ve gotten a really good look at what’s coming in the fall, though Google is still keeping plenty of details under wraps. We don’t know yet if it plans to say if it had help from other manufacturers in coming up with Tensor, and details about CPU and GPU cores, clock speeds and other components will be shared later this year. But with the new chip, Google’s been able to realize a years-long dream.</p><p>“We kind of see this as The Google Phone,” he said. “This is what we set out to build several years ago and we’re finally here.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">75b90b61-1229-4618-88c8-85112803ae09</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 16:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627931663</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T19:14:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc7dc2f0-f283-11eb-9d38-3989c4f60031" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc7dc2f0-f283-11eb-9d38-3989c4f60031" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A rendering of Google's Tensor chip.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Tensor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will use AI everywhere]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Smartphone launch season is typically in the fall, but Google has unexpectedly early news to share today. The company just announced that not only is the Pixel 6 coming this fall, but it’ll feature the very first system-on-chip designed by Google. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html">chip is called Tensor and it leverages the company’s AI expertise</a> to enable more powerful and better integrated machine learning on devices. At a demo event to show off Tensor’s prowess, I was able to check out the Pixel 6 with the company’s chief of hardware Rick Osterloh. I wasn’t allowed to take pictures or video, and Google hasn’t shared all of the phones’ specs, but I can tell you about a few new features.</p><div id="bfc813bd2fe84b039480a23702b2a002"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d1aDjlGNdiQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>First, there will be two lines: Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google hasn’t shared the actual dimensions yet, but the Pro, which is larger, felt similar in size to a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. They both look like <a href="https://www.frontpagetech.com/2021/07/08/exclusive-full-final-specifications-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro/">the leaked renders we’ve seen</a>, except shinier and three-dimensional. There’s a band about an inch tall on the rear in black, lime green or peachy red, and below that sits a horizontal camera bump that stretches across the case. According to Google&#39;s blog post, the sensors and lenses were improved and &quot;are now too big to fit into the traditional square.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yes, when you place the Pixel 6 on a table there’s still a slope because of the bar, but since it’s not off to a corner like on prior Pixels (or Galaxy phones or iPhones), the phone won’t wobble from side to side. The rest of the back is black, pastel green or pastel peach correspondingly.</p><p>For the Pro line, the colors are more subtle with less contrast between the sections, but they have what Osterloh called “high gloss metal accents” along the edges. The camera bump also gets this shiny treatment on the Pros, which come in black, white and sort of a light orange. The regular Pixel 6 has a matte finish on its sides. All the phones I saw appeared to have glass on their backs, with screens that are slightly curved along the edges. Google also moved the selfie camera from the top left corner to the middle of the display.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/05ad8eb0-f283-11eb-bff7-d139a54bce0d" alt="Three Pixel 6 phones.

(Google doesn’t have names for the colors yet, though Osterloh said their marketing team has fun with them.)</p><p>More importantly, Google’s upgraded the cameras themselves. It’s not sharing specific megapixel or sensor size information yet, but did say these are sharper and larger sensors than before. Osterloh said the Pixel 6’s main camera will let in about 150% more light than previous Pixels. There’s also an ultrawide lens for both models, and the Pro gets an extra telephoto option as well with 4x optical zoom.</p><p>In addition to the actual camera hardware improvements, the Pixel 6s promise better photo processing thanks to Tensor. At our meeting, Osterloh highlighted changes coming in how Google will process images and videos for clearer, better exposed images of moving subjects. The company was also able to apply things like an HDRNet to video as it’s recording a scene to ease tricky situations like shooting a campsite with the phone pointed at the sun.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3a661be0-f283-11eb-8ebf-11a88cc103bd" alt="A trio of Pixel 6 Pros. From left to right, their color schemes are: Black/black, Gold/yellow and Grey/silver." data-uuid="116553b4-3a08-320c-aea2-0cde70db847f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google also redesigned its speech software, with a new platform called SODA (Speech On Device API) that lets apps leverage Tensor for data-center-level speech recognition. Better yet, Osterloh said this all runs at half the power it used to on prior Pixels. He showed me a new Live Caption with Translate feature that subtitles all audio playing through your phone’s sound system. With Tensor, the device can both transcribe and translate what’s playing at the same (ish) time, without needing to use the cloud for processing.</p><p>Dictation is also getting some major upgrades. In GBoard on the Pixel 6, you’ll be able to hit the microphone button in the compose field, narrate your message and use hotwords like “Send” or “Clear” to trigger actions. You can also edit typos via the onscreen keyboard while the mic is still listening for your dictation.</p><p>We don’t have all the details on CPU and GPU cores or clock speeds, RAM and battery life yet — those will come later. But Osterloh did say Google knows “users expect to get a day’s worth of battery life,” and that it’s aiming for that mark but to also “offer them a lot more capability in that period of time.” The devices will also support 5G, which “in the US means supporting all the different bands we have here,” Osterloh said. He declined to name any brands of 5G modems, though.</p><p>Though it’s not an official launch for the Pixel 6, this preview has shown us a lot. There will be new cameras, new design, new UI (in Android 12) and a new chip, among other things. Osterloh said he’s excited about the launch. “We kind of see this as The Google Phone,” he said. “This is what we set out to build several years ago and we’re finally here.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9027784a-8270-49e0-a68f-14a5282dec20</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 16:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627931721</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T19:15:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a6bfa10-f282-11eb-bbdf-ac92842b242f" width="1600" height="942" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a6bfa10-f282-11eb-bbdf-ac92842b242f" width="1600" height="942" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Six Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro devices laying on a grey surface at various angles, perpendicular to each other.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[R2-D2 is now a Tamagotchi you’ll forget about]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>R2-D2 might be the most beloved character in the entire <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20wars">Star Wars</a> universe.

The newly introduced L75ms doesn&#39;t have a catchy name, but it combines a slick-looking walnut wood cabinet with a higher-end speaker system that includes both a 32-bit/192kHz DAC and modern streaming audio conveniences. While you can&#39;t really use the built-in Bluetooth for lossless sound, you can use the Ethernet and other wired connections to stream top-tier audio, including through AirPlay 2 and Chromecast.</p><p>The company even offers a 90-day <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-qobuz-drops-lossy-music-streaming.html">Qobuz</a> trial to help sell you on the concept.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This could be a sweet-sounding system regardless of the audio source. The L75ms includes a pair of 1-inch titanium dome tweeters with wave guides, two 5.25-inch white cone woofers and a 4-inch mid-range driver, all of them with dedicated channels for amp and DSP tuning.  They sit on a &quot;multi-angled&quot; baffle, too. On top of the networking, you&#39;l find a 3.5mm input, a vinyl-friendly moving magnet phono stage and ARC-capable HDMI for connecting to your TV. You can connect an external subwoofer if you need deeper, separated bass.</p><p>The L75ms won&#39;t ship until the fourth quarter of the year, and it won&#39;t be a trivial expense at $1,500. However, it&#39;s also a rare combination of high-res audio, streaming support and a relatively compact design that would look right at home in many living rooms. You might not need much else to get the most out of a premium music service.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jbl-l75ms-hifi-streaming-speaker-145857987.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3d7a2705-5972-49a8-baee-f513c48eed23</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 14:58:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627916339</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T14:59:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d1b01e00-f39c-11eb-bf67-f839fce2061c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d1b01e00-f39c-11eb-bf67-f839fce2061c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JBL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JBL L75ms HiFi speaker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JBL L75ms HiFi speaker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Apple TV bug is muting some purchased and rented movies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some folks who buy or rent movies on Apple TV are running into a major issue when they watch films through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-app-playstation-4-5-launch-availability-113246540.html">the app</a>.

It&#39;s not as mystical as it sounds, but it could lead to a major change in military and government operations.</p><p>The machine learning-based system observes changes in raw, real-time data that hint at possible trouble. If <a href="https://www.engadget.com/space-xs-next-starlink-launch-will-help-improve-satellite-imagery-of-the-earth-130033228.html">satellite imagery</a> shows signs that a rival nation&#39;s submarine is preparing to leave port, for instance, the AI could flag that mobilization knowing the vessel will likely leave soon. Military analysts can take hours or even days to comb through this information — GIDE technology could send an alert within &quot;seconds,&quot; VanHerck said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The most recent dry run, GIDE 3, was the most expansive yet. It saw all 11 US commands and the broader Defense Department use a mix of military and civilian sensors to address scenarios where &quot;contested logistics&quot; (such as communications in the Panama Canal) might pose a problem. The technology involved wasn&#39;t strictly new, the General said, but the military &quot;stitched everything together.&quot;</p><p>The platform could be put into real-world use relatively soon. VanHerck believed the military was &quot;ready to field&quot; the software, and could validate it at the next Globally Integrated Exercise in spring 2022.</p><p>The advantages of this predictive AI are fairly clear. Instead of merely reacting to events or relying on outdated info, the Pentagon could take proactive steps like deploying forces or ramping up defenses. It could also provide an &quot;opportunity&quot; for the civilian  government, VanHerck added. He didn&#39;t provide examples, but this could help politicians call out acts of aggression while they&#39;re still in the early stages.</p><p>There are still limitations. The AI is looking for out-of-the-ordinary clues, such as a greater number of parked cars or aircraft. It can&#39;t say for certain what&#39;s happening — humans will still be heavily involved. Even so, the tech could be worthwhile if it prevents a &#39;surprise&#39; attack or leads to negotiations instead of conflict.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pentagon-ai-predicts-days-in-advance-135509604.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ccea19f-9ca5-4b16-a40f-4e459cf18d59</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 13:55:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627912407</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T13:53:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Military & Defense]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/073b94a0-f1c4-11e9-8f5b-2c0832cca481" width="2900" height="1537" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/073b94a0-f1c4-11e9-8f5b-2c0832cca481" width="2900" height="1537" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[icholakov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US pentagon building aerial view at sunset]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US Pentagon at sunset]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Klipsch T5 II ANC earbuds use Bragi AI to let you answer calls by nodding]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Klipsch&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/klipsch-t5-ii-t5-ii-sport-true-wireless-earbuds-specs-price-availability-110014906.html">redesigned T5 II</a> true wireless earbuds are a big improvement over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-06-klipsch-t5-true-wireless-earbuds-review.html">the T5</a> that debuted in 2019. However, the company&#39;s 2020 models didn&#39;t offer active noise cancellation (ANC) and only the pricier Sport version had wireless charging. Today, Klipsch is making both of those standard features with <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/t5-ii-true-wireless-anc-earphones">the T5 II ANC</a>, plus it&#39;s throwing in AI-powered features from true wireless pioneer Bragi and Dirac HD Sound. All of the additions make this model a true flagship, right down to the premium price of $299.&nbsp;</p><p>The T5 II ANC has the same design for both the earbuds and the case as the T5 II. The buds were retooled after the original T5 to make them more comfortable. Klipsch still includes six sets of oval silicone ear tips to help you find the best fit, but the T5 II ANC is only IPX4 rated water resistant (compared to the T5 II&#39;s IP67). Inside, the company uses a redesigned 5.8mm driver with a thinner diaphragm that it says improves sound quality across all frequencies.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Klipsch takes the audio profile a step further with some help from Dirac&#39;s HD Sound technology. Dirac is known for its &quot;digital audio optimization,&quot; and in 2020 the company announced plans to both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-dirac-headphone-audio-correction-dsp.html">recalibrate your headphones</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dirac-spatial-audio-headphone-bluetooth-chips-130017379.html">integrate its sound tech directly inside future products</a>. For the T5 II ANC, Klipsch says HD Sound will improve staging, clarity, voice and bass while still allowing you to apply custom EQ settings at you see fit.&nbsp;</p><p>Another key element of the T5 II ANC are the hands-free gestures called Bragi Moves. Bragi was one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-20-bragi-dash-review.html">first companies to build true wireless earbuds</a>, long before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-01-apple-airpods-best-selling-true-wireless-earbuds.html">Apple helped popularize</a> the product category. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-16-bragis-dash-pro-earbuds-ai.html">Dash line of earbuds</a> not only worked better than many of the early options, but they were also packed with more tech: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-02-bragi-dash-update-kinetic-siri-wireless-earbuds.html">gesture controls</a>, on-board music storage, fitness tracking, real-time translation and more.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2019, Bragi announced that it had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-01-bragi-sells-off-hardware-business.html">sold its hardware business to focus on software and AI</a>. Klipsch is one of the first to integrate the company&#39;s gesture controls, including the ability to answer calls by nodding or to skip tracks by shaking your head. Bragi&#39;s tech will also enable Sidekicks or automated processes like turning on ANC when you listen to music or activating transparency mode when you get a call. Klipsch and Bragi said more features will be available in the future.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4cbde4c0-f33d-11eb-9a7f-a6b8cd3d5e4a" alt="Klipsch T5 II ANC McLaren Edition" data-uuid="401a11af-e932-3b73-a067-2ac248c466ec"><figcaption>Klipsch T5 II ANC McLaren Edition</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Klipsch</div></figure><p>The noise-cancelling setup on the T5 II ANC employs dual microphones on each earbud (feedforward and feedback) to catch as much external distraction as possible. Like the T5, this model also includes a transparency mode so you can tune into your surroundings when needed. Klipsch promises &quot;loud and clear&quot; calls as well, with six beamforming microphones and automatic noise suppression.&nbsp;</p><p>All of those new features led to less battery life. With ANC on, Klipsch says you can muster five hours of listening on the buds themselves. That&#39;s down from eight on the T5 II and T5 II Sport. When you disable the noise-cancelling feature, the company says you can expect two more hours of use. The included case holds 21 additional hours (three full charges) and Qi-compatible wireless charging is on board.&nbsp;</p><p>Like it did with the T5 II Sport, Klipsch is offering <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/t5-ii-true-wireless-anc-mclaren-edition-earphones">a McLaren Edition</a> of the T5 II ANC. The company is a sponsor for McLaren&#39;s Formula 1 team, so it&#39;s bringing papaya orange, carbon fiber and a tire tread pattern from the track to your earbuds. This special version carries all of the same features of the regular T5 II ANC, but it comes with a wireless charging pad and it&#39;s equipped with NuCurrent charging tech. Klipsch says this feature combined with the McLaren Edition case &quot;will charge twice as fast as anything else on the market.&quot; Racing fans will have to pony up an extra $50, though: the special edition is $349.&nbsp;</p><p>Both <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/t5-ii-true-wireless-anc-earphones">the T5 II ANC</a> and <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/t5-ii-true-wireless-anc-mclaren-edition-earphones">T5 II ANC McLaren Edition</a> are available starting today.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="c59dac8c-0b51-4c2c-bf01-2c92198f2aba"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/klipsch-t5-ii-anc-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-130001664.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cbe4bb2d-13db-4595-9494-9dc922f3dbe8</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 13:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627922335</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T16:39:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/01041150-f327-11eb-9f3e-6dbb2b1e6ec8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/01041150-f327-11eb-9f3e-6dbb2b1e6ec8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Klipsch]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Klipsch T5 II ANC]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Klipsch T5 II ANC]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's 512GB M1 Mac Mini falls back to $799 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve been eyeing Apple&#39;s latest Mac Mini as your next desktop, now is the time to act. You can currently get the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB model" href="https://amzn.to/37fhSjq">512GB model</a> for $799 at Amazon, or $100 off the normal $899 price. The deal brings the desktop down to just below the record low we saw in March and April. It also means you&#39;re only paying $100 more for double the storage of the $699 base model.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Mac Mini M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $799" href="https://amzn.to/37fhSjq">Buy Mac Mini M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $799</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That should come in handy if you plan to take full advantage of the Mac Mini&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">M1 chip</a>. As we&#39;ve <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">previously</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">noted</a>, Apple&#39;s in-house silicon is a powerhouse that makes quick work of most tasks, be it browsing bloated websites or opening creative editing software. Inside the desktop, you&#39;ll find an 8-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores and a 16-core Neural Engine. Unlike with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">iMac</a>, you&#39;ll also need your own display and peripherals like a keyboard and mouse.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few caveats, however. The Mac Mini&#39;s RAM and storage aren&#39;t upgradeable and the two rear Thunderbolt ports won&#39;t please those who need extra monitors and faster connectivity. Apple also offers 16GB unified memory, up to 2TB SSD storage and 10 Gigabit Ethernet support at a cost. In fact, the true top-of-the line Mac Mini will set you back $1,799. Saying that, the specs available on this deal model should please most casual users.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-deal-123413396.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47481a7f-ad42-4da6-ae91-e4a3c9650059</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 12:34:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627907657</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T16:16:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dcba6960-f38b-11eb-bc7f-bf7d76504fdd" width="2880" height="1620" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dcba6960-f38b-11eb-bc7f-bf7d76504fdd" width="2880" height="1620" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube trials a cheaper 'Premium Lite' subscription that only removes ads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to boost YouTube Premium sign-ups, Google has offered everything from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-mini-youtube-premium-giveaway-143245422.html">free hardware</a> to access to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tubes-experimental-features-now-require-a-paid-premium-account-092633439.html">unique features</a>. Now, it&#39;s going back to basics. The company is testing a lower-priced subscription plan in parts of Europe that gives you ad-free viewing without offline downloads, YouTube Music and background playback. A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/so-youtube-premium-lite-ad-free-sub-is-a-thing-now-in-select-countries.465198/">Resetera user</a> first spotted the new YouTube Premium Lite tier in Netherlands, Finland and Sweden while trying to cancel the paid-for service.&nbsp;</p><p>The plan costs €6.99 ($8.32) per month, the same as the student tier, whereas the normal price is €11.99 ($14.26).

There&#39;s also automatic pause that stops what you&#39;re listening to when you start talking.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh1000xm4-headphones-deal-100858922.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a3caaf1a-9203-4469-bc81-0f17c4ea3104</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 10:08:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627903687</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T11:28:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6ad2b130-f378-11eb-b77f-ba77e059b6d6" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6ad2b130-f378-11eb-b77f-ba77e059b6d6" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony WH-1000XM4]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony WH-1000XM4]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scientists spot light behind a black hole for the first time]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a short span of time, astronomers have taken us <a href="https://www.engadget.com/astronomers-spot-light-from-black-hole-collision-132942574.html">closer</a> to black holes than ever with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-10-first-image-of-black-hole.html">unprecedented</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-hole-picture-magnetic-fields-203218860.html">images</a> of the cosmic giants.

As part of the breakthrough, researchers witnessed and captured the light from the back of a supermassive black hole 800 million light years away.&nbsp;</p><p>The latest breakthrough is a &quot;key part of the puzzle to understanding&quot; how the universe came to be, according to Stanford astrophysicist Dan Wilkins.

These were the &quot;luminous echoes&quot; of of the flares bouncing off the gas behind the black hole. This phenomena was first predicted by Einstein in his theory of relativity published in 1916.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6705a7d0-f371-11eb-97cf-a4858d090687" style="height:2250;width:4000;" alt="Black hole" data-uuid="56e7ca65-e3b7-3c2c-ae16-4481fde939f6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ESA</div></figure><p>“Any light that goes into that black hole doesn’t come out, so we shouldn’t be able to see anything that’s behind the black hole,&quot; Wilkins explained. “The reason we can see that is because that black hole is warping space, bending light and twisting magnetic fields around itself.”</p><p>The supermassive black hole is 10 million times as massive as our Sun and located in the centre of a nearby spiral galaxy called I Zwicky 1. An international group of scientists witnessed the echoes using the European Space Agency&#39;s XMM-Newton and NASA’s NuSTAR space telescopes.

Prices in the category can range from $80 to $800 for extras including app-based controls, compatibility with smart assistants like Alexa, access to more data and customization. As part of its first stab at a smart air purifier, IKEA is looking to break into the market by sticking to its hallmarks: Affordability and minimalism.&nbsp;</p><p>The Swedish flatpack giant is releasing two &quot;Starkvind&quot; devices, a floor-standalone air purifier and a side table model, which cost $129 and $189, respectively.

Both IKEA purifiers are identical inside: They contain a three-filter system designed to capture bigger particles like hair and dust; 99.5 percent of smaller airborne particles that measure less than 2.5 micrometers (or one 400th of a millimeter) and dust and pollen; and pollutants like formaldehyde and even bad odors.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/11603c90-ef94-11eb-beff-ad88b5a0ca35" alt="IKEA air purifier" data-uuid="21c79b6a-2c32-3f57-9b5b-95f27372b5db"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure><p>The Starkvind also has five different fan speeds that can be used on their own or controlled and scheduled from the IKEA Home app in conjunction with its TRÅDFRI smart home hub.

While an auto mode relies on a built-in sensor to automatically adjust the fan speed based on the amount of smaller particles in the air.
