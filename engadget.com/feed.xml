The company&#39;s only active program at the moment is for the Solar Roof, which awards referrers with monetary rewards of up to $500 and free Powerwalls.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla&#39;s referral program has changed tremendously over the years. The automaker used to promise new Roadsters for top referrers and up to six months of free Supercharging. That eventually became too expensive to be sustainable, so the company decided to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-17-tesla-ends-customer-referral-program.html">axe the program</a>. Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-21-tesla-new-referral-program.html">introduced</a> a new one with more reasonable rewards shortly after that, though, promising at least 1,000 miles of free Supercharging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When it relaunched the program with updated terms, the company said that it &quot;heard from... customers that the Referral Program was one of their favorite reasons to tell their friends about Tesla.&quot; It&#39;s unclear if it would come back again this time for the same reason, but we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it does. Take note, however, that Tesla has yet to fulfill some of its bigger promises to referrers. As <em>Electrek</em> notes, it hasn&#39;t delivered the Roadsters its top referrers earned yet, and people have been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/pqddxj/is_the_tesla_referral_program_done_as_of/hdaj01e/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">complaining</a> on online forums about not receiving free Powerwalls and other rewards from years ago.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-kills-referral-programs-194950736.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a919438-8fb8-4922-a640-5cda07c78d83</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 19:49:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631992803</ingested><modified>2021-09-18T19:20:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e48158b0-185d-11ec-b3ff-63ea806f78c2" width="1600" height="1015" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e48158b0-185d-11ec-b3ff-63ea806f78c2" width="1600" height="1015" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon has banned over 600 Chinese brands as part of review fraud crackdown]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you noticed some well-known tech accessory makers disappearing from Amazon? Those aren&#39;t just rare incidents — they&#39;re part of a larger campaign. In a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680269/amazon-ban-chinese-brands-review-abuse-fraud-policy">response</a> to <em>The Verge</em>, Amazon has confirmed a <em>South China Morning Post</em><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3149203/amazon-closes-3000-chinese-brand-online-stores-campaign-against-fake">report</a> that the internet giant has banned over 600 Chinese brands (spread across 3,000 seller accounts) over review fraud incidents.  These firms intentionally and repeatedly violated review policies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-04-amazon-bans-reviews-posted-in-exchange-for-free-products.html">banning incentivized reviews</a>, Amazon said.</p><p>The online retailer first broke word of the figure in an interview with VP Cindy Tai on the state-controlled network China Central Television.

The venders were caught offering rewards, including gift cards, for customers leaving reviews. Amazon later booted RAVPower, Vava and other relatively well-known brands for similar behavior. It&#39;s not clear how many non-Chinese brands have faced bans.</p><p>There are signs these vendors are either dodging bans or have otherwise escaped some detection, such as Aukey earbuds under the Key Series brand. However, it&#39;s safe to say the wider anti-fraud strategy has significantly changed Amazon&#39;s marketplace — much to the chagrin of banned companies that heavily depended on Amazon-based sales.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-bans-chinese-brands-for-review-fraud-191820086.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">08938d3a-b1c4-4454-b6bd-4ccda286228d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 19:18:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631992702</ingested><modified>2021-09-18T19:18:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cda4160-18af-11ec-bfff-cf42af4cf180" width="3685" height="2372" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cda4160-18af-11ec-bfff-cf42af4cf180" width="3685" height="2372" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1438748063527575555">told Twitter users</a> that Starlink should exit beta &quot;next month&quot; — that is, sometime in October. You could theoretically could use the quicker-than-usual service in more countries, or at least without the stigma of beta testing involved.</p><p>The company had aimed for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-global-coverage-084815155.html">complete worldwide coverage</a> by September. To date, the beta has been largely limited to North America and parts of Europe, with notable exceptions like Australia, Chile and New Zealand. Planned expansions are so far limited to Mexico and Japan, but SpaceX has registered subsidiaries in countries like the Philippines and South Africa.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The formal launch could be crucial. SpaceX said it had shipped 100,000 Starlink terminals as of late August, but that number is likely to swell as the beta label disappears and more countries get access. And while satellite service is far from new, Starlink&#39;s high bandwidth and low latency could help close the gap for broadband in rural areas and developing countries where conventional internet access is either unavailable or too slow to be practical.</p><p>This is, of course, provided Starlink arrives as promised. Musk and his companies have a history of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-29-spacex-starship-first-commercial-flight-2021.html">optimistic timetables</a> for projects that get stalled by technical hurdles and other practical realities. An October launch certainly isn&#39;t out of the question, but you might not want to plan your schedule around that  launch just yet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/starlink-beta-end-date-181729796.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">01a823e5-5444-4f0a-b173-8b243d981a8d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 18:17:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631989051</ingested><modified>2021-09-18T18:17:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/25a46aa0-18a7-11ec-abae-ed4549b57240" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/25a46aa0-18a7-11ec-abae-ed4549b57240" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pablo Sanhueza / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Starlink antenna is seen on the roof of the John F Kennedy School located in the village of Sotomo, outside the town of Cochamo, Los Lagos region, Chile, August 7, 2021.

First, James Trew put the GoPro Hero 10 Black through its paces and was impressed by the capabilities of the new GP2 processor. Next, Billy Steele listened to Jabra’s $80 Elite 3 earbuds and, due to the combination of price and features, deemed them one of the company’s best gadgets. Lastly, Terrence O’Brien played around with the Arturia SQ80V synth emulator only to be charmed by its fluid user interface and timeless sounds.</p><h2>The GoPro Hero 10 Black <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-10-review-a-big-invisible-upgrade-130041612.html">benefits from a new processor</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1340a5b0-163e-11ec-bfe9-460febe0f005" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="GoPro Hero 10 review." data-uuid="148a4c97-ca73-388d-90c2-1570d611c215"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>James Trew is plain about the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:GoPro Hero 10 Black" href="https://fave.co/3ClOJjY">GoPro Hero 10 Black</a>: it is remarkably similar to last year’s model, save for the impressive, new GP2 processor. That chip brings a boost in frame rates across the board, including 5.3K at 60fps. It’s also responsible for the updated HyperSmooth 4.0 stabilization technology, which makes for smoother shooting scenarios, a speedier user interface, faster offloading of media and even improvements to the front-facing display. GoPro says the GP2’s capabilities can help produce improved photos and videos as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In James’s testing, this was well born out: He saw noticeably better image quality from the Hero 10 Black than from the Hero 9. James said the difference in detail was instantly noticeable at 100-percent crop, where the Hero 10 was able to capture textures like road surface or leaves. He also enjoyed the added flexibility that came with the new resolution and frame rate combinations — another bonus of the GP2 processing power. The Hero 10 Black also adds a hydrophobic lens coating, which keeps water droplets from gathering in blurry drips, 4K video at 120fps for respectable slow-mo, and a good, old-fashioned wired transfer. With one of the only drawbacks being a shorter battery life, James says that the Hero 10 takes everything that was working for GoPro devices and builds on it.</p><h2>The Jabra Elite 3 earbuds offer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">excellent value and impressive sound</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1a9dd330-17d0-11ec-b9ff-fd8dff276c0a" alt="Jabra Elite 3" data-uuid="b486f59a-5667-393c-a3f0-d9cdb9d78ae0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Jabra Elite 3" href="https://amzn.to/3lCMHoY">Jabra Elite 3</a> earbuds have a lot going for them: they’re affordable, have functional controls, a comfortable fit courtesy of a new design, impressive sound quality and a solid feature set. Billy Steele says they far exceeded his expectations and offer an incredible value for their $80 price tag. During testing, he was immediately impressed by the sound quality, which was adept at highlighting details like the rattle of a snare drum. While he found the call quality to be only serviceable, he found other features — like a mute control on the earbuds — well thought-out. He was also pleased with the nearly seven-hour battery life.</p><p>However, low-cost models will forgo some things you may take for granted on other earbuds, and here, the Elite 3 buds lack wireless charging and active noise cancellation. Billy said one of the few drawbacks with the Elite 3’s was the missing auto-pause feature — he found it annoying, but not a dealbreaker. He also mentioned that the only EQ customizations are available in presets, but that the Elite 3 outperformed similar models here due to its balanced tuning and great clarity. With few drawbacks, Billy deemed them one of the best wireless products from Jabra.</p><h2>Arturia’s SQ 80V is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-sq-80-v-ensoniq-virtual-synth-hands-on-superbooth-160036483.html">synth emulator modeled after a classic</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a4ffb2a0-17d0-11ec-9fff-4f9ed364e44e" alt="Arturia SQ80 V" data-uuid="6d929858-7b0b-3996-b16c-b653d6342f66"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien spent some time tweaking the knobs on <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/sq80-v/sounddesign">Arturia’s new SQ 80V</a>, a synth emulator designed to mimic the dusty charm of the Ensoniq SQ-80.

Why slog through malaria-infested jungles, parched deserts and frozen tundra when you could simply float an expedition to its destination? Among the technology&#39;s most fervent adherents were famed Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen and Italian airship designer General Umberto Nobile. In 1928, Nobile attempted to lead the first expedition to land people at the North Pole aboard Airship <em>Italia</em>. However, a brutal storm forced the vessel to crash land, stranding its survivors with precious few provisions and setting off the largest arctic rescue effort in history.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/n-4-down-mark-piesing"><em>N-4 Down</em></a>, by journalist and author Mark Piesing chronicles that rescue effort, led by Amundsen himself.

It consisted of two flying boats, no hangars, and a rough runway made from ice.</p><p>For the flight he had a team of six men who would be split between the two planes. Lincoln Ellsworth would be in one, Amundsen in the other. The Norwegian had also brought with him for the first time two journalists and a photographer to record the expedition.</p><p>The flying boats that Amundsen transported from Pisa, Italy, weren’t just any flying boats. The N-24 and N-25 were state-of-the-art Dornier Do J “whale” flying boats, which went on to pioneer many air routes across the world.</p><p>These expensive German-designed machines were cutting edge in 1925. This meant that they were all metal, with a whale-shaped hull and high, raised wings. Two stub wings, known as sponsons, kept the plane stable, while ribs on the hull gave the plane the strength to land on sea or ice. Two chunky Rolls-Royce Eagle propeller engines were arranged back to back: one to pull the plane through the air and the other to push it. The Eagle engines were the first aeroengines that Rolls-Royce ever built.</p><p>Alas, the pilots were still housed in an unheated open-air cockpit, obliged to wear woolen underwear, sweaters, two pairs of pants, a sealskin greatcoat as well as a leather jacket, a leather flying helmet, gloves, scarves, and heavy boots to stay warm while flying at high speeds. They all had a parachute (one of the conditions Ellsworth’s father made him agree to in exchange for his money), though the terrible battle to survive they would face if their parachutes worked was something it was better not to think about.</p><p>The state of aerial navigation wasn’t much better. Pilots, who still who relied on distinguishing features such as railways, rivers, and castles to help them work out where they were going, were always going to be challenged by the featureless and shifting Arctic landscape. As mariners had done for the last two hundred year, sextants could be used to determine their aircraft’s altitude, position, and ground speed. These sextants were of less use, of course, when visibility was blocked by fog or thick clouds. Then these early pilots could use a magnetic compass, which becomes less reliable the closer to the North Pole the aircraft flies, or a solar compass, which worked like a sundial by using the position of the sun to establish a bearing (particularly useful near the North Pole).</p><p>Radio had started to challenge these far older methods of navigation. Radio direction finding allowed a navigator to find the direction to a radio station, or beacon. Then if you could pick up the signals of two or more stations, or beacons, then you could work out where you were by simple triangulation. Airplane navigators had to take all these readings in conditions that didn’t lend themselves to accuracy, taking measurements and keeping records in what was usually a freezing cold — and sometimes open — cockpit in a noisy and unstable machine.</p><p>Unfortunately for the crew of his new expedition, the Amundsen of 1925 was not the Amundsen who beat Scott to the South Pole. It could be said that he had lost his eye for detail.</p><p>The planes had been test flown in the Mediterranean before they were shipped by train and boat to Kings Bay. What they hadn’t been was properly test flown in the below-freezing conditions of the Arctic. In 1925, no one really understood how these flimsy aircraft and their internal combustion engines would cope with the cold of the Arctic, and Amundsen didn’t seem particularly curious about the possible distinction. Then there were the sextants that didn’t work and the radio sets that hadn’t arrived yet, and which Amundsen decided they couldn’t wait for. Finally, Amundsen didn’t formulate any emergency procedures in the event that one of the planes had to land. Without the radios, there was no way for the crews to talk to each other midflight if something went wrong. He had compounded this risk by turning down the US Navy’s offer of the giant airship USS<em> Shenandoah</em> to act as a rescue ship the year before. But he did remember to take a moving-picture camera with them.</p><p>Amundsen’s haste was due to his worry that a narrow window in the Arctic weather was set to close. There was also the nagging fear that someone else would fly to the North Pole before him.</p><p>Finally, on May 21, 1925, after one last leisurely, rather staged cigarette to calm their nerves, and with a final shove of the plane from the miners — who were given the day off for the occasion — the two overloaded planes roared one after the other across the rough-ice runway like toboggans, the crews feeling every bump in the ice through the flying boats’ metal hull, then out on to the water and into the air. “It was unreal, mystic, fraught with prophecy,” Ellsworth wrote. “Something ahead was hidden, and we were going to find it.”</p><p>The low-lying fog quickly cleared. The film that the crew shot of the glaciers of Svalbard comprised the first images ever taken from the air of these rivers of ice.</p><p>Amundsen’s dream of flying over the Arctic Sea was realized. The explorers were covering in hours what would take a week to do with dogs and skis. “I have never seen anything more desolate and deserted,” Amundsen remarked. “A bear from time to time I would have thought, which could break the monotony a little. But no—absolutely nothing living.”</p><p>After eight hours, they should have been near the North Pole, and the plan was to try to land. But one of the engines of Amundsen’s plane started to splutter on their descent. It quickly became apparent that they had to land rather sooner than they wanted.</p><p>“I have never looked down upon a more terrifying place in which to land an airplane,” Ellsworth wrote. For what had looked like smooth ice from high altitude turned out to be cut by ridges, gaps of open water called leads, and icebergs.</p><p>Amundsen’s plane made it down safely thanks to the skills of his pilot. Ellsworth’s was not so lucky. His plane eventually found a stretch of water they too could land on. Unfortunately, distances are deceptive at that height and what had seemed long enough was too short. Ellsworth’s plane bounced across the surface of the sea and smashed into an ice floe. Water poured in. That the rivets on the hull had burst due to the rough takeoff only added to their problems.</p><p>Soon there was nothing Ellsworth and his men could do to rescue it; the flying boat floated there like a dead whale. Ellsworth’s men were cold and wet, and they had been awake for twenty-four hours. They needed rest and food, but there wouldn’t be any of either for a while. They had to try their best to protect the plane from being crushed by the ice or sinking while they tried to salvage what they could. Eventually they stopped, exhausted—and the peril Ellsworth and his men were in suddenly hit him. “In the utter silence this seemed to me to be the kingdom of death,” he wrote.</p><p>The two crews were now separated from each other by many miles. It was twenty-four hours before they spotted each other across the ice pack.</p><p>Even when they were in sight of each other, communication across the ice was hampered because no one knew Morse code or semaphore. Instead, the two crews managed to get a rudimentary flag system going between them. It took two to three hours to communicate a simple message. Walking across the ice wasn’t an option either. It was simply too dangerous.</p><p>They were lucky in the end. The blocks of sea ice floated closer together, making it possible for the crews to be reunited after five interminable days. This still wasn’t without risk. Attempts by the men to walk across the ice floes with as much equipment as possible nearly ended in disaster when two of them sank through the slush into the freezing water. One of the men screamed, “I’m gone! I’m gone,” as the current tried to pull him under the ice.</p><p>Amundsen looked shockingly changed, exhaustion and anxiety cut deep into his face, but he was now back in the world of the ice pack, a world he knew so well. Quickly he took control. He realized that they had to combine the supplies from both planes to give themselves a chance of survival. More important, perhaps, they were able to siphon the fuel out of Ellsworth’s plane to give them enough to reach home again with the heavier load of all the men on board. But before they could attempt this, they first needed to carve a runway out of the ice. Of course, they hadn’t brought any specialized tools with them, despite having planned to land at the North Pole.</p><p>Without radio contact, the world first suspected that something had gone wrong when the planes didn’t return to Kings Bay straight away. Even then, some people thought that the aviators could have stayed at the pole for a couple of days or even flown on to Alaska, as Amundsen had long wanted to do. Some remembered conversations where Ellsworth had said it might take a year for them to walk out of the wilderness if their plane crashed.</p><p>When nothing was heard from them, newspapers across America started to report that the planes were overdue. There were demands for a rescue effort to be launched. But the lack of ships, planes, airships, and any idea of where Amundsen and his men had crashed presented would-be rescuers with a fearsome challenge. Still, the pressure was there. One headline in the <em>New York Times </em>proclaimed, “Coolidge Favors Amundsen Relief Should He Need It; President Would Approve Naval Plan to Send One of Our Giant Dirigibles to the Arctic.”</p><p>The US Navy was keen to launch its own expedition to rescue Amundsen. Two years earlier, naval plans to explore the Arctic with one of its huge dirigibles had been canceled owing to the expense. Now they were pushing the president to dispatch the giant USS<em> Shenandoah</em> or USS<em> Los Angeles</em> airships to search for Amundsen. Either of the two ships could be ready in days for the mission, sources told the <em>New York Times</em> journalist. The flight itself to Greenland (a possible base for the mission) would then take a couple of days, depending on the weather and where the ships were based at that time. “Practically, every officer connected with the aeronautical service of the Navy will volunteer in the event that a call for help is made on behalf of Amundsen,” the reporter explained.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-n-4-down-mark-piesing-harpercollins-153021951.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fbef8094-da8e-4507-bc49-15fb0f968f00</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 15:30:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631907821</ingested><modified>2021-09-17T19:43:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a82b7aa0-1671-11ec-addf-354f26244be2" width="5326" height="3608" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f7e3f4f0-1671-11ec-bfbd-b743ca0f7b32" width="6020" height="3103" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DE AGOSTINI PICTURE LIBRARY via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airship Italia moored in King's bay, Spitsbergen island, Norway, from L'Illustrazione Italiana, Year LV, No 23, June 3, 1928.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Airship Italia moored in King's bay]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel reportedly used a remote-controlled gun to assassinate an Iranian scientist]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Countries have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-21-americas-drone-strike-program-needs-a-low-tech-fix.html">assassinated people with drones</a>, but those attacks now appear to include robotic weapons on the ground. <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/18/world/middleeast/iran-nuclear-fakhrizadeh-assassination-israel.html">sources</a> claim Israel assassinated top Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh on November 27th, 2020 using a remotely-controlled, AI-assisted machine gun. Israel reportedly mounted the gun on a pickup truck by the side of the road and, when Fakhrizadeh&#39;s car approached had a distant operator fire the gun using a satellite link.</p><p>The attack was precise, sparing Fakhrizadeh&#39;s wife, but may not have used facial recognition to assist with aiming as unnamed Iranian officials said. While Israel purportedly used the AI to compensate for the satellite system&#39;s lag and gun recoil, operatives identified Fakhrizadeh by staging a decoy car with a camera to force a U-turn and get a clear image.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Neither government has publicly confirmed the use of a robotic gun, although <em>The Times</em>&#39; story is based in part on the Fakhrizadeh family&#39;s statements to the media. Iranian investigators only determined the nature of the attack by chance, according to the sources. The Israeli operatives exploded the truck in a bid to destroy the evidence, but the equipment remained intact (if inoperable).</p><p>The use of this technology isn&#39;t surprising. While the remote gun was supposedly difficult to set up (Israel smuggled parts in very gradually), it both kept agents out of harm&#39;s way and avoided raising alarms like a drone. If the gun had been destroyed as planned, Iran might have been unable to determine the assassination method.</p><p>If accurate, the report might point to the future of espionage. Assassins can now use robotics to take out targets with little risk to themselves, little warning to enemies and a greater chance of deniability. You won&#39;t necessarily see a surge of assassinations as a result (Fakhrizadeh ignored multiple security recommendations), but there&#39;s a real chance this won&#39;t be the last kill of its kind.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/israel-remote-control-iran-scientist-assassination-144746205.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b8267849-e914-492a-8bcc-2b1f9aa4d02a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Sep 2021 14:47:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631976468</ingested><modified>2021-09-18T14:47:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5b757a40-1887-11ec-8fb6-7743c40b08a7" width="4500" height="3000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5b757a40-1887-11ec-8fb6-7743c40b08a7" width="4500" height="3000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wana News Agency / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A protester holds a picture of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, Iran's top nuclear scientist, during a demonstration against his killing in Tehran, Iran, November 28, 2020.

It has different types of rooms you can use, including ones where you can have intimate, private conversations with friends — and in the future, you may be able to invite those friends to chat by &quot;waving&quot; at them. Jane Manchun Wong, who&#39;s famous for reverse engineering apps to find hidden experimental features, has discovered that Clubhouse is working on a new way to invite contacts to have an audio conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>If the feature gets a wide release, Clubhouse will add a &quot;Wave&quot; button on users&#39; profiles that looks similar to the Wave button you see when you first connect with someone on Messenger. Tapping on it will let a friend know you want to chat, and the app will only open a room for you if they respond.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ddb8ae9cd7084543aca0b6e321e953eb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Clubhouse is working on Waves,<br><br>so that you can slowly form a room with your friends when they all are ready instead of having them to chat with you right away<br><br>(hi clubhouse ;) i love this idea btw) <a href="https://t.co/OrODAC5GmI">pic.twitter.com/OrODAC5GmI</a></p>— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) <a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1438931407322042369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Clubhouse started out as an invite-only audio app for iOS wherein you&#39;ll have to join a waitlist to get in. Over the past few months, though, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-clubhouse-android-app-is-now-available-worldwide-082506070.html">released</a> an app for Android and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clubhouse-beta-open-to-everyone-audio-chat-170029064.html">opened</a> its doors to everyone.

The developer used those details to modify the malware.</p><p>AT&amp;T claims Fahd and his associates unlocked just over 1.9 million phones through the scheme. The company says because of the unlocks, customers didn&#39;t complete payments on their devices, leading to the nine-figure loss.</p><p>Fahd was arrested in Hong Kong in 2018 following a 2017 indictment.

If you don’t use an app after several months, the OS can revoke some of the permissions that the application asked you to grant when you first installed it.

The feature will come courtesy of a Google Play services update the company will roll out to “billions” of devices.
