As the company did with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-master-and-dynamic-mw07-plus-review.html">its MW07 model</a>, another version of the MW08 is making its debut today. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:MW08 Sport" href="https://fave.co/3771O3j">MW08 Sport</a> offers all of the features that make the MW08 so good, including 12-hour battery life, excellent sound quality and improved active noise cancellation (ANC). This new Sport option is made with different materials, has more ear tips in the box and it comes with a wireless charging case. However, the additions tack $50 onto the price.</p><p>Instead of the ceramic and aluminum combo that we saw on the MW08, the MW08 Sport pairs the metal accents with sapphire glass. Master &amp; Dynamic says the new material is scratch and shatter resistant which the company argues gives these earbuds the ability &quot;to withstand any workout.&quot; Like the previous version, the MW08 Sport is IPX5 rated, which means they should withstand a sweat session with no issues. There are also some changes for the MW08 Sport&#39;s charging case. The company&#39;s familiar shiny stainless steel was a fingerprint magnet and it didn&#39;t take much for it to begin showing scratches. That material has been replaced with Kevlar fiber, so the case has a more tactile soft-touch coating with a black and gray pattern. And, of course, it should also be more durable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/74589590-ee7c-11eb-b7fe-98a451dac12b" alt="Master &amp; Dynamic MW08 Sport" data-uuid="05d242b2-0969-30c2-8f43-822de5fb4a67"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Master &amp; Dynamic</div></figure><p>More importantly, the included case now supports wireless charging, which is likely the primary cause for the price increase. As you might expect, Master &amp; Dynamic made its own pad to support this feature, an accessory that will debut alongside the MW08 Sport <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:for $69 (&#x0020ac;69/&#xa3;59)" href="https://fave.co/3zHpKX4">for $69 (€69/£59)</a>. The company says wireless charging for the case itself will give you 50 percent battery in 30 minutes and a full charge will take just over an hour and a half. Compare that to 15 minutes for half or an hour for a full charge with a USB-C cable. Charging times for the earbuds in the case are unchanged from the MW08: 50 percent in 15 minutes and an hour for a complete top off.&nbsp;</p><p>The last big change for the MW08 Sport is the selection of ear tips. Like the MW08, Master &amp; Dynamic gives you five sets of silicone tips to help you find the best fit. For the Sport model, the company is also throwing in two sizes of foam tips that offer a more secure fit for workouts. Based on my experience using the MW08 Sport for the last week, the foam tips are more comfortable than the silicone options too.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/27ccd9b0-ee46-11eb-ab2a-a11a57fae78c" alt="Master &amp; Dynamic MW08 Sport" data-uuid="28c4ccbd-db75-3c1b-9806-372318c1ee4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Master &amp; Dynamic</div></figure><p>Inside, the MW08 Sport is unchanged from the the MW08. The earbuds pack 11mm Beryllium-coated drivers to power their stellar sound. Dual-mode ANC returns, giving you the option of blocking as much of the world as possible (ANC Max) or a setting for &quot;less noisy&quot; spots (All Day ANC). The company&#39;s two ambient sound modes are also back, with one dedicated to conversation and the other suited for more general use. The only bummer here is you still have to choose your ANC and ambient sound mode inside of Mater &amp; Dynamic&#39;s app. The on-board controls don&#39;t cycle between the two, but activate your last selection when you turn on either noise cancellation or ambient mode from the earbuds.</p><p>Battery life is also unchanged, and that&#39;s a good thing. The MW08 Sport offers 12 hours of battery life on the buds themselves with 30 additional hours in the charging case.&nbsp;</p><p>The new materials, additional ear tips and wireless charging bring the cost of the MW08 Sport up to $349. That&#39;s $50 more than the MW08. In addition to black and white colors that are similar to the MW08, navy and green options are available on the MW08 Sport.

The automaker has revealed during its most recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sets-delivery-record-by-building-and-shipping-200000-vehicles-in-q-2-213045738.html">earnings call</a> that it has pushed back the truck&#39;s arrival — yet again — to 2022, three years after its original launch target in 2019. Last year, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-semi-delayed-to-2021-222022916.html">announced</a> that it had to delay the vehicle&#39;s release to 2021 but didn&#39;t elaborate on what prompted the decision and if it was primary due to the pandemic. Now, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/tesla-delays-semi-truck-to-2022-cybertruck-back-burnered-for-model-y/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Tesla told shareholders that the Semi truck will be delayed due to the limited availability of battery cells and global supply chain challenges.</p><p>The whole statement reads:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;We believe we remain on track to build our first Model Y vehicles in Berlin and Austin in 2021. The pace of the respective production ramps will be influenced by the successful introduction of many new product and manufacturing technologies, ongoing supply-chain-related challenges and regional permitting.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To better focus on these factories, and due to the limited availability of battery cells and global supply chain challenges, we have shifted the launch of the Semi truck program to 2022. We are also making progress on the industrialization of Cybertruck, which is currently planned for Austin production subsequent to Model Y.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As <em>TechCrunch</em> notes, Tesla executive Jerome Guillen also left the company in June, just a few months after he started leading the trucking division. While the automaker didn&#39;t say whether his departure was in any way connected to the Semi&#39;s delay, Guillen used to lead Tesla&#39;s entire automotive business until he was made president of the Heavy Trucking unit in March.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-16-tesla-unveils-its-vision-of-the-future-of-trucking.html">announced</a> the Semi back in 2017, promising an electric big rig with a 500-mile range and technologies that include Enhanced Autopilot. It&#39;s been traveling all around the US and has apparently been capable of doing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-26-tesla-semi-truck-travels-cross-country-alone.html">cross-country trips</a> on its own without escorts since 2018, relying entirely on Tesla&#39;s existing Supercharger network. Elon Musk told staff in an internal email last year that the Semi is ready to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-semi-elon-musk-volume-production-153933911.html">enter mass production</a>, but the company&#39;s readiness doesn&#39;t mean anything without the truck&#39;s components.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delays-semi-truck-2022-102502178.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aebfbae8-bdd4-4c79-883d-64c9a87cc12a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 10:25:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627381628</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T10:27:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/65bc1430-eeb8-11eb-9a3f-142d8b690772" width="1600" height="985" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/65bc1430-eeb8-11eb-9a3f-142d8b690772" width="1600" height="985" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's second-gen Echo Buds fall to Prime Day lows at Best Buy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2nd-gen-review-130018884.html">Echo Buds</a> have dropped to below $100 for the first time since Prime Day. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Best Buy" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/P0KePQ">Best Buy</a> is offering the wired charging model of the active noise-canceling earbuds for $80, down from their normal price of $120. If you prefer wireless charging, that particular model is back down to $100, a savings of $40. The Alexa-powered buds were already affordable, but the latest deal could sway those still on the fence. Especially considering that they were only released in April.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Amazon Echo Buds at Best Buy - $80" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/P0KePQ">Buy Amazon Echo Buds at Best Buy - $80</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Amazon Echo Buds (Wireless charging case) at Best Buy - $100" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/e4qyNX">Buy Amazon Echo Buds (Wireless charging case) at Best Buy - $100</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon improved its Echo Buds in all the right places with the second-gen model. With the right tweaks in the Alexa app, you can boost the audio, and take full advantage of the big bass, courtesy of that new 5.7mm high-performance driver. Amazon&#39;s digital assistant can also complete a range of tasks, from firing up music and podcasts to setting reminders and even fetching transit info for some US cities.</p><p>The overhaul also extends to the design. Both the earbuds and the charging case are 20 percent and 40 percent smaller, respectively. At this price, however, you can expect some cutbacks. One of the few areas that remains the same is the battery life, which offers five hours overall and two hours from just a 15-minute charge. The only other shortcoming is that the buds don&#39;t always block out noisy backgrounds on calls. But, with a little in-app customization, you can crank up your voice to help overcome that.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-deal-092943719.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3b7bcfc-812b-488e-bc6e-6c5433dce439</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 09:29:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627386161</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T11:43:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/61522d90-eebc-11eb-ae5d-8c005fc10918" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/61522d90-eebc-11eb-ae5d-8c005fc10918" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Echo Buds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Echo Buds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel will build chips for Qualcomm as part of its ambitious foundry plans]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, Intel unveiled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html">detailed plans</a> for its future chip technology, describing how it plans to catch rivals TSMC and Samsung by 2025.

Samsung thinks it has an answer. The company will start taking pre-orders for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2021-tv-lineup-availability-150003304.html">long-teased</a> Odyssey Neo G9 display on July 29th for $2,500. Yes, you could buy a nice PC for less than the cost of this curved, 49-inch beast — although you might have good reasons to buy this over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-gaming-monitor-odyssey-g-7-28-4-k-144-hz-084535416.html">smaller, flatter</a> Odyssey screens.</p><p>As you might have guessed, the use of mini-LED delivers very high contrast ratios for an LCD monitor. Samsung claims a black level of just 0.0004. However, you&#39;re also getting extremely bright HDR thanks to a peak brightness of 2,000 nits that makes many TVs seem dim by comparison. Customizable lighting effects help add to the flash.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You should also see the same 5,120 x 1,440 resolution, 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms pixel response time from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-curved-gaming-monitors-us-prices-120014874.html">last year&#39;s Odyssey G9</a>, not to mention connectivity that includes two HDMI ports, DisplayPort and a pair of USB 3.0 connections.</p><p>You&#39;re clearly getting features that are hard to match. However, it&#39;s also apparent that Samsung is targeting a fairly narrow audience — The Neo G9 is meant for well-heeled gamers who want the most immersive non-VR experience possible. It could easily hit the sweet spot if you&#39;re in that demographic, but creative pros (and anyone on a budget) will probably want to look elsewhere.</p><div id="aa9477bf83e74f7498b24436f6701912"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKH1VUFCS-w?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-price-pre-order-020000540.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3fc3f15-25fd-4b55-ac78-3360ba194e75</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627309360</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T14:22:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/675f0c80-ee0d-11eb-af77-b9881b362301" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/675f0c80-ee0d-11eb-af77-b9881b362301" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 mini-LED curved gaming monitor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 mini-LED curved gaming monitor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung says an S Pen for foldables is coming at Unpacked]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-date-august-11-foldable-smartwatch-no-note-000036462.html">upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event</a>, Samsung has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/unfold-next-era-of-smartphone-innovation/?utm_source=pr_media&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=unpck">published a blog post</a> by its president TM Roh that basically tells us what it plans to announce next month. In addition to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-wear-os-one-ui-watch-unpacked-2021-171520963.html">new Galaxy Watch powered by Wear OS</a>, the company will be launching the third generation of its Galaxy Z series and &quot;the first-ever S Pen designed specifically for foldable phones.&quot;</p><p>A stylus made for the pliable screens on foldables like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">the Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review.html">Z Flip</a> has been a widely requested feature, and would make the larger, opened up displays more useful. Of course, Samsung shared little else about this S Pen besides the fact that it&#39;s coming, so there are plenty of unknowns at the moment. How will it avoid damaging the softer, flexible screen? How precise will the stylus be? What size is its nib, what is its pressure sensitivity and will the foldables have onboard slots to house it? Will it have Bluetooth support for remote control actions? Clearly, these are things we&#39;ll have to wait till Unpacked on August 11th to learn about.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Roh also confirmed that Samsung will not be launching a new Note handset at the event, saying that &quot;Instead of unveiling a new Galaxy Note this time around, we will further broaden beloved Note features to more Samsung Galaxy devices.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0a2d3c70-ee3b-11eb-9e4f-0bf9b07a8131" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2" data-uuid="fb718e43-99e2-36ea-8e4d-5d2be2b3f156"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chris Velazco / Engadget</div></figure><p>As for the third generation of the Galaxy Z phones we&#39;ll be seeing at the event, Roh said the company has &quot;lined up even more partner apps that make the most of the versatile fold-out format.&quot; We can expect &quot;hands-free optimized video calling with Google Duo and watching videos in Flex mode on YouTube,&quot; as well as &quot;multitasking in Microsoft Teams.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, too, the next Galaxy Z Flip will have &quot;an even more refined style&quot; and &quot;more durable, stronger materials,&quot; while the upcoming Z Fold will &quot;combine the very best that smartphones and tablets offer and [deliver] completely new ways of working, connecting and creating.&quot;</p><p>The language is unsurprisingly vague, as Samsung can&#39;t give away all the details ahead of Unpacked. But it clearly also wants people to be excited — excited enough that they might be temped to reserve one of the new Z series devices already. If you choose to go through <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:the company&#39;s Reserve Now program" href="https://fave.co/3rrxI40">the company&#39;s Reserve Now program</a>, you can trade in up to two devices, including phones, tablets and wearables, towards a new Galaxy product. I&#39;d recommend till we learn more about what&#39;s coming on August 11th before doing that, and you can join us on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Engadget/videos">Engadget&#39;s YouTube channel </a>to watch Unpacked live.

Not only did Tesla build and ship 200,000 vehicles during the quarter, a 151 percent increase over last year, it also earned $1.1 billion in net income during the same period — a whopping tenfold increase year over year. Overall, revenue grew 98 percent from this time last year thanks in large part to Tesla&#39;s increased deliveries though the company did suffer from a &quot;Bitcoin-related impairment&quot; of $23 million during the past quarter.</p><p>Additionally, Tesla rolled out 85 MW worth of solar capability in Q2, a 215 percent increase from last year&#39;s 25 MW as well as added nearly 1,000 Supercharging stations to its ever expanding network. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also revealed more details about the company&#39;s plan to open its Supercharger network to other EV brands later this year.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We&#39;re currently thinking it&#39;s a real simple thing where, you just download the Tesla app, go to a supercharger and just indicate which stall you&#39;re in,&quot; he explained. &quot;And this should basically work with almost any manufacturers&#39; cars.&quot; Non-Tesla owners could see a few constraints in their use of the Supercharger network, Musk pointed out. &quot;if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be charged more.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Public sentiment towards EVs is at an inflection point and, at this point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward,&quot; Musk said during the call. He did note, however, that the ongoing global shortage of microchips remains an cantraining force on vehicle production. &quot;Regarding supply chain, while we&#39;re making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious... it does seem like it&#39;s getting better, but it&#39;s hard to predict.&quot; Musk said, warning that the issue will likely not be resolved before the end of this year.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of tech, Tesla&#39;s use of radar as part of the vehicle&#39;s Full Self Driving system will soon be coming to an end. &quot;After selling over a million vehicles equipped with radar, we have collected enough data to start removing it in some regions,&quot; the company wrote in <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22">its shareholder deck</a>. &quot;The removal of radar, which is enabled by our collection of a vast dataset of corner cases, allows us to focus on vision and increase the pace of improvement.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Musk also commented on the recent launch of Tesla&#39;s FSD subscription which launched last month. &quot;We expected to build slowly and gather a lot of momentum over time,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously, we need to have the full self driving boat widely available for it really to take off... I think FSD subscription will be a significant factor probably next year.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The company is also getting closer to switching over to its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-battery-day-25k-ev-231307638.html">4680 battery cells</a>, having successfully validated the battery tech&#39;s &quot;performance and lifetime&quot; at its California-based fabrication facility. With that testing out of the way, Tesla is focusing on &quot;improving the 10 percent of manufacturing processes that currently bottleneck production output,&quot; though the company has not yet announced when the battery style  changeover will actually take place.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sets-delivery-record-by-building-and-shipping-200000-vehicles-in-q-2-213045738.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8772d6b-522e-4246-8a5b-df8e30c06d5d</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 21:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627367276</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T06:28:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cb62bc0-ee50-11eb-bfbd-2f482d134668" width="3716" height="2280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cb62bc0-ee50-11eb-bfbd-2f482d134668" width="3716" height="2280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VCG via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SHANGHAI, CHINA - JULY 11: Aerial view of new-energy vehicles sitting on a truck at Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory of Lingang New Area on July 11, 2021 in Shanghai, China.

Now, that node is just called &quot;Intel 7,&quot; according to the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-accelerates-process-packaging-innovations.html#gs.6vgrqn">company&#39;s revised roadmap</a>. But don&#39;t go thinking that means Intel is somehow delivering a 7nm processor early — its long-delayed &quot;Rocket Lake&quot; 7nm chip still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">won&#39;t ship until 2023</a>, and its node has been renamed to &quot;Intel 4.&quot; Confused yet? It&#39;s almost like Intel is trying to attach a new number to these upcoming products, so we&#39;ll forget it&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-processors-upscaled-150059592.html">losing the shrinking transistor war against AMD</a>.</p><p>But Intel&#39;s prospects are more interesting as we look ahead to 2024, when the company expects to finalize the design for its first chips with transistors smaller than 1 nanometer. They&#39;ll be measured by angstroms, instead. The &quot;Intel 20A&quot; node will be powered by &quot;RibbonFET&quot; transistors, the company&#39;s first new architecture since the arrival FinFET in 2011. It&#39;ll be coupled with PowerVia, a technology that can move power delivery to the rear of a chip wafer, which should make signal transmission more efficient.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e38a88f0-ee55-11eb-bfef-d1f03272e4c9" alt="Pat Gelsinger Intel" data-uuid="a54c36dd-738a-3977-9926-59a232802176"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>“Building on Intel’s unquestioned leadership in advanced packaging, we are accelerating our innovation  roadmap to ensure we are on a clear path to process performance leadership by 2025,” Intel&#39;s new CEO Pat  Gelsinger (above) said during the &quot;Intel Accelerated&quot; livestream today. “We are leveraging our unparalleled  pipeline of innovation to deliver technology advances from the transistor up to the system level. Until the periodic table is exhausted, we will be relentless in our pursuit of Moore’s Law and our path to innovate with the magic of silicon.”</p><p>Before it reaches the angstrom era of chips, though, the company also plans to release a processor with an &quot;Intel 3&quot; node in 2023. You can think of it as a super-powered version of its 7nm architecture, with around an 18 percent performance power watt improvement over Intel 4. It&#39;ll likely fill the timing gap between Rocket Lake chips in 2023 and the Intel 20A products in 2024. Intel is also daring to call its shot beyond 2024: it&#39;s also working on an &quot;Intel 18A&quot; node that&#39;ll further improve on its RibbonFET design.</p><p>For consumers, this roadmap means you can expect chips to get steadily faster and more efficient over the next five years. If anything, the announcements today show that Intel is trying to move beyond the 10nm and 7nm delays that have dogged it for ages.&nbsp;</p><p>As we&#39;ve previously argued, it&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-foundry-7nm-plan-analysis-141532580.html">ultimately a good thing for the tech industry </a>if Intel can finally regain its footing. Its $<a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">20 billion investment in two Arizona-based fabrication plants </a>was a clear sign that Gelsinger aimed to bring the company into new territory. But now that it&#39;s laid out a new timeline, there&#39;ll be even more pressure for Intel not to let things slip once again.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">853499cd-dbc1-4d7b-8492-b0d6e16f83a5</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 21:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627334341</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T21:19:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/768adb80-ee53-11eb-9cfb-8894f971b119" width="4142" height="2762" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/768adb80-ee53-11eb-9cfb-8894f971b119" width="4142" height="2762" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Intel logo is displayed on computer screens at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017.

They used new and archival datasets from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hubble%20space%20telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> to find the vapor, which forms when ice on the surface sublimates and turns from solid to gas.</p><p>A team led by Lorenz Roth of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden examined data captured by Hubble&#39;s Cosmic Origins Spectrograph in 2018 and images the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph obtained between 1998 and 2010. Ultraviolet images captured by the STIS in 1998 showed “colorful ribbons of electrified gas called auroral bands,” according to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/hubble-finds-first-evidence-of-water-vapor-at-jupiter-s-moon-ganymede">NASA</a> (which launched Hubble as a joint project with the European Space Agency).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Researchers previously believed that atomic oxygen may have caused discrepancies between UV images that were captured over time.

As such, there had to be another reason for the discrepancies.</p><div id="1ed9bfa1f31044d69e845e3080db198d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxvJ3a0bCbY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The temperature at Ganymede&#39;s equator may become warm enough for surface ice to release some water molecules. When they re-examined the relative distribution of the aurora in the UV images, Roth&#39;s team found that differences between them match up with where water would be expected in the moon&#39;s atmosphere.</p><p>Previous research indicated that Ganymede may hold more water than in all of our oceans. The moon&#39;s ocean is believed to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-13-nasa-proves-that-jupiters-biggest-moon-is-hiding-an-ocean.html">around 100 miles below the surface</a>, so the vapor isn&#39;t from there.

In an <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news-archive/open-letter-to-administrator-nelson">open letter</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-bill-nelson-nasa-administrator-140348221.html">NASA Administrator Bill Nelson</a>, Bezos said his company is willing to waive up to $2 billion in payments from NASA in the current and next two federal fiscal years in return for a fixed-price lander contract. Bezos said Blue Origin is also willing to fund its own pathfinder mission to low-Earth orbit. &quot;This offer is not a deferral, but is an outright and permanent waiver of those payments,&quot; Bezos said in the letter. &quot;This offer provides time for government appropriation actions to catch up.&quot;</p><p>While Bezos spends a significant part of his letter talking about Blue Origin&#39;s commitment to &quot;advance America&#39;s future in space,&quot; his offer isn&#39;t altruistic. At the heart of it is the belief that NASA unfairly excluded his company from a lucrative and prestigious contract. When it comes to its most important projects, NASA has historically handed out agreements to multiple contractors to promote competition and ensure it can get a mission off the ground on time if one company falls behind schedule. In its latest procurement, NASA didn&#39;t do that, and Blue Origin filed a protest with the federal government shortly after that.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the time, a Blue Origin spokesperson told Engadget NASA &quot;executed a flawed acquisition for the Human Landing System program and moved the goalposts at the last minute.&quot; That&#39;s something Bezos reiterates in his letter. &quot;Instead of investing in two competing lunar landers as originally intended, the Agency chose to confer a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar head start to SpaceX,&quot; the former Amazon CEO said. &quot;That decision broke the mold of NASA&#39;s successful commercial space programs by putting an end to meaningful competition for years to come.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s hard to say how NASA will respond to the open letter. The Human Landing System project <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lunar-lander-gao-223702744.html">can&#39;t move forward</a> while the US Government Accountability Office reviews the protest from Blue Origin. Notably, this isn&#39;t the first time a Bezos-affiliated company has got itself into a contract dispute with the US government. In 2019, Amazon challenged the Department of Defense&#39;s decision to award Microsoft its $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud contract. After a nearly two-year-long legal battle, the Pentagon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/department-of-defense-cancels-jedi-contract-172009337.html">canceled that project</a> at the start of July in favor of a new multi-vendor project that will hand out work to both Amazon and Microsoft.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-nasa-open-letter-181522642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">452460d2-eec5-4e6c-a8e3-7760c735c573</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 18:15:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627323326</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T18:15:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/200352f0-e66b-11eb-9c7f-9e1364ce59d9" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/200352f0-e66b-11eb-9c7f-9e1364ce59d9" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Clodagh Kilcoyne / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Founder, Chairman, CEO and President of Amazon Jeff Bezos unveils his space company Blue Origin's space exploration lunar lander rocket called Blue Moon during an unveiling event in Washington, U.S., May 9, 2019.

Another major element of the redesign is the addition of gondolas at two of the new points of interest. According to Respawn, the idea here was to replicate some of the “dynamic gameplay” that trains offered in the original version of the map.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="36a2ba66c5794b4f82d2d89ff4c31ae5"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQBKoZIYNrs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Outside of the redesigned World’s Edge, we also get to see the game’s new Rampage LMG in action, which will allow players to knock down doors from a distance.

As robots increasingly move out of labs, off of factory floors and into our everyday lives, a similar garment revolution could soon be upon us once again, according to a new research study out of New York’s Cornell University.</p><p>“We believe that robot clothes present an underutilized opportunity for the field of designing interactive systems,” the team argues in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3461778.3462045"><em><ins>What Robots Need From Clothing</ins></em></a>, which was submitted to the In Designing Interactive Systems Conference 2021. “Clothes can help robots become better robots — by helping them be useful in a new, wider array of contexts, or better adapt and function in the contexts they are already in.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“I started by looking at how different materials would move on robots and thinking about the readability of that motion — like, what is the robot&#39;s intention based on the way materials move on the robot,” Natalie Friedman, a PhD student at Cornell Tech and lead author on the paper, explained to Engadget. “From there, I started thinking about all the different social functions that clothes have for people and how that could influence how the robot is viewed.”</p><p>While tomorrow’s robots may wear white button down dress shirts and black bow ties while serving hors d&#39;oeuvres to party guests or wear candy stripes while working as nurses, it’s not simply a matter of tossing human clothing onto a robotic chassis. “What robot clothes <em>are</em> is integrally tied to what robots <em>need</em> from clothing. Robot clothing should analogously fulfill needs robots have, rather than just being human clothes on a robot,” the researchers wrote.</p><p>Robo-clothes could take any number of forms, depending on their wearer’s specific function. Robotic firefighters, such as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1y_qA5o5ZM"><ins>Thermite from Howe and Howe</ins></a>, might theoretically be issued heat-resistant overcoats akin to what humans wear but embedded with thermochromic ink to provide the robot’s operator an easy visual reference to the area’s ambient temperature or indicate that the robot is in danger of overheating. Conversely, search-and-rescue bots could wear waterproof garments when conducting oceanic operations and then strap on extra-grippy boots when searching for lost hikers in mountainous terrain or survivors of a building collapse.</p><p>&quot;I think this work is important to helping engineers and technologists understand the functional importance of aesthetics and signaling in design,” Cornell Tech professor and co-author Wendy Ju, said in a recent blog. “It&#39;s not ‘just fashion’ - what the robot wears helps people understand how to interact with it in ways that are critical to safety and task execution.&quot;</p><p>Overall, the use of swappable attire could lead to more generalized robot designs as the specific capabilities the clothing provides don&#39;t have to be baked into the robot’s construction. “It is more difficult to build a new robot than to build new clothes,” Friedman said. “I think that clothes are going to influence robot design and robot designs are going to influence clothes. Maybe it&#39;ll start in one direction — clothes made to fit robots — but, in the future, I think that robots might be built to better fit in clothes.” She notes that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pepper-robot-softbank-robotics-face-mask-ai-152744854.html"><ins>Pepper</ins></a>, though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/softbank-stopped-production-pepper-robots-032616568.html"><ins>recently discontinued by SoftBank</ins></a>, offers an online merch store with a wide variety of costumes and outfits for the robot to wear including outfits designating cultural, national, professional and religious affiliations.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4a1b1d30-ec28-11eb-9ff9-2f375fb06125" style="height:3337;width:5000;" alt="Pepper human-shaped robot while celebrating the Buddhist funeral rites to the Tokyo Int&#39;l Funeral &amp; Cemetery Show in Tokyo August 23, 2017.

For example, clothing could help protect a robot’s sense of shame — or rather that of its user.</p><p>“The need for wire modesty — to cover up nudity — stems from anthropomorphic priggishness, since robots do not get embarrassed about wires poking out of them,” the researchers wrote. “However, both humanoid and non-humanoid robots have pragmatic reasons to maintain a clean and covered aesthetic, because exposed wires present a real risk to function. Any wire that is pulled out or cut will remove power or signal to a subsystem, and that can be risky to the robot and any people or objects in the environment.”</p><p>“I definitely see a future where [when robots] aren&#39;t wearing clothes, it might look a little funny,” Friedman added. “I mean we are just mapping our ideas onto robots, right? Robots don’t have  consciousness, so they don&#39;t feel shame.”</p><p>However, putting clothes on robots could also prove problematic especially if the apparel style has been culturally appropriated. You can bet your bottom dollar that the first cannabis dispensary to dress an automated budtender in rastafarian garb is going to make headlines — and not the kind that are good for business — same as if you outfitted a Roomba with a Native American headdress. “Hawaiian shirts, for example, used to be a marker of ‘casual Friday’ office attire, but more recently are affiliated with the extremist ‘Boogaloo Boys,’” the researchers wrote.</p><p>Despite the potential drawbacks to putting pants on robots, doing so could help make the entire field of research more attractive to a new generation of roboticists. “I like to think about girls in robotics,” Friedman said. “When they&#39;re young, I think robotics seems like a really intimidating thing but I see clothes as kind of a way to welcome, you know, the stereotypically feminine... skills that women have. I see clothes as a way to welcome girls into [robotics].”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/why-every-robot-needs-a-spiffy-hat-160039522.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b4b9b14c-1f22-4967-9f84-cbdd18ac105b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 16:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627096321</ingested><modified>2021-07-24T03:12:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Clothes & Apparel]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a1032670-ec27-11eb-a9b7-23de8de98226" width="5067" height="3378" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/762e5640-ec27-11eb-b9bf-81cc03870e98" width="5390" height="3158" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Besjunior via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Renovation interior improvement concept.

Kojima Productions publishing head Jay Boor told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> in an <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-07-23-death-stranding-has-sold-five-million-copies-on-ps4-and-pc">interview</a> that the sci-fi courier game has sold five million copies across PS4 and PC.</p><p>That&#39;s not as strong as <em>Metal Gear Solid V</em>, which moved six million copies in just the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-01-29-mgs-v-sells-6m-pushes-konami-digital-profits-up-by-150-percent">first few months</a> after its September 2015 debut. However, <em>Death Stranding</em> was also a brand new franchise that leaned mainly on Kojima&#39;s reputation (plus some big-name actors) to reel players in. Five million sales is no mean feat in that context, especially when other legendary game developers have sometimes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daikatana">struggled</a> without the support of their best-known development teams.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The timing for these figures isn&#39;t a coincidence. The studio is using the sales numbers to build hype for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-trailer-release-date-220511148.html"><em>Death Stranding Director&#39;s Cut</em></a> coming to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html">PlayStation 5</a> in September. At the same time, they suggest Kojima Productions isn&#39;t going away any time soon — at least, so long as Kojima&#39;s fan base (and his keen eye for cinematics) remains intact.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-sales-151610579.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1286180b-4d26-40b2-97d9-a8c5785e74fa</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 15:16:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627313006</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T15:23:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4d7f2170-ee25-11eb-b795-557f73f2fb0b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4d7f2170-ee25-11eb-b795-557f73f2fb0b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kojima Productions]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A still from the video game 'Death Stranding' showing the closeup of a character wearing red-tinted sunglasses.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Death Stranding]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Duo 2 leak hints at a massive camera upgrade]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-review-software-camera-specs-130024046.html">Surface Duo</a> drew flak for delivering outdated specs at top-tier prices (among other missteps), but that might not be true for the sequel. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/images-microsofts-upcoming-surface-duo-2-leak-revealing-triple-camera-setup"><em>Windows Central</em></a> has shared a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PQJOndIdGk"><em>Tech Rat</em></a> leak purporting to show images of the Surface Duo 2, and they suggest Microsoft is dragging its dual-screen Android phone into the modern era.

It brings the virtual-racing action into the real world with tiny karts that zoom around your home on tracks you create yourself. A single set is fairly expensive at $100 — especially considering you need a Nintendo Switch to use it at all — but now you can grab either than <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Mario" href="https://amzn.to/3kXSIOA">Mario</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Luigi" href="https://amzn.to/3BIgAeH">Luigi</a> set from Amazon for only $75. That&#39;s a return to the game&#39;s all-time-low price, so now&#39;s the time to grab it if you&#39;ve had your eye on it for a while.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit at Amazon - $100" href="https://amzn.to/3kXSIOA">Buy Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit at Amazon - $100</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both <em>Home Circuit</em> sets come gates that you set up around your home to build your own racetrack, plus a camera-equipped kart operated by either Mario or Luigi. However, one set only comes with one car, so you will need to sets if you want to race IRL with your friend or family member (a single-player mode is supported as well). You will need a bit of space to set up your track — approximately a 10 x 12 foot area — but once the track is place, you can use the Joy-Cons of your Switch to control the kart.</p><p>You can switch up your track simply by moving the gates around, but the game will make things more challenging by making you race underwater, in an 8-bit world and more. The in-game obstacles will affect your very real kart by making it slow down or speed up, so you&#39;ll likely run into new challenges very time you race even if your IRL track stays the same. And like in traditional <em>Mario Kart</em>, you&#39;ll collect items as you zip around the track. <em>Home Circuit</em> is a compelling add-on for diehard <em>Mario Kart</em> fans, but also those that want a new way to experience the game.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-mario-kart-live-home-circuit-mario-luigi-sets-75-sale-amazon-131051344.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dadeca43-4c5d-46b7-a329-64794c41f7b2</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 13:10:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627303819</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T12:50:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/d3eaafd0-7518-11eb-af7f-8b857f71a184" width="675" height="380" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/d3eaafd0-7518-11eb-af7f-8b857f71a184" width="675" height="380" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo Mario Kart Live: Home Circuit]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify will now notify you of new releases from your favorite artists]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spotify is introducing a feature to notify people when their favorite artists and podcast producers have a new release to check out.

So it was no surprise that the company decided to give it a proper sequel earlier this year. What <em>was</em> a surprise, though, was that along with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/novation-circuit-tracks-groovebox-hands-on-synthesizer-drum-machine-160021950.html">Circuit Tracks</a>, Novation also announced the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Circuit Rhythm" href="https://bit.ly/3y7yaa2">Circuit Rhythm</a>, an entirely sample-based instrument. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/circuit-rhythm-is-a-portable-400-sampler-for-budding-beatmakers-150001845.html">Rhythm</a> combines the simplified, screen-free workflow that made the Circuit so popular with a full-featured sampler and performance effects that clearly were inspired by the SP-303 and SP-404. The big question is whether or not what makes the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/novation-teases-circuit-rhythm-sampler-groovebox-drum-machine-lofi-h-p-hop-183709200.html">Circuit</a> so compelling when playing and sequencing synths translates to chopping up loops and capturing oneshots.</p><p>Physically, the <a href="https://novationmusic.com/en/circuit/circuit-rhythm">Circuit Rhythm</a> and <a href="https://novationmusic.com/en/circuit/circuit-tracks">Circuit Tracks</a> are nearly identical. The faceplate is light gray instead of black, and some of the labels on the controls are different, but they’re built on the same core platform. The front has the same 32 RGB velocity sensitive pads, along with 28 buttons for switching views and tracks, plus eight endless encoders for changing various parameters, and two knobs dedicated to volume and the master filter. Around back you’ll also find five-pin MIDI In, Out and Thru ports; USB-C for power and connecting to your computer; a 3.5mm sync jack for connecting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/korg-volca-sample-2-upgrade-midi-usb-sampler-164549834.html">Volcas</a> and the like; a headphone jack; and ¼-inch stereo ins and outs. Oh, and of course there’s a rechargeable battery that Novation says should last up to four hours. In my testing I haven’t quite hit that mark, but I haven’t been too far off either — about three to three and a half hours.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Then the core of the Rhythm is its eight monophonic sampler tracks. And, even though there are only eight tracks you can use “sample flip” to place multiple samples on a single track. For instance your kick and snare, so long as they don’t overlap.</p><p>All of this is pretty impressive considering the Circuit Rhythm’s $400 price tag and portable size. But what seems great on paper doesn’t always translate to the real world.</p><p>That being said, Novation did do a lot right. For one, it’s important that the company saw fit to build an actual sampler and not just a sample-based groovebox, like Elektron’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-05-elektron-model-samples-review-groovebox.html">Model:Samples</a>. Don’t get me wrong, I love the Model:Samples. But if you’re looking to spontaneously sample something you’ve been jamming on, or to chop up soul loops, it’s not gonna help you. The actual workflow for sampling and then doing basic editing, chopping, etcetera is pretty easy to wrap your head around too. In fact, I’d go so far as to call it fun. I’ve definitely been in a creative rut recently and stepping out of my comfort zone to slice up samples from YouTube and make some lo-fi and boom bap-inspired beats has helped me get back to enjoying making music again, even if what I’m making is objectively <em>not </em>good.</p><div id="bb2dcdd9563e4cfca98634926fe59c3b"><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1091749771%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-QCpIUu9Esx2&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true"></iframe><div style="font-size:10px;color:#cccccc;overflow:hidden;white-space:nowrap;font-family:Interstate, Lucida Grande, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Sans, Garuda, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;font-weight:100;"><a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast" title="Engadget" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Engadget</a> · <a href="https://soundcloud.com/engadget-podcast/circuit-rhythm-review/s-QCpIUu9Esx2" title="Circuit Rhythm review samples" target="_blank" style="color:#cccccc;text-decoration:none;">Circuit Rhythm review samples</a></div></div><p>The 32-step Circuit sequencer also remains a strong suit. It’s simple, intuitive and deceptively powerful. You can program a beat manually or play it in “unquantized” (in reality this is simply quantized to the microsteps — of which there are eight per step, but it gets close enough in most cases). You can automate most of the parameters across a pattern, then chain patterns together to create longer progressions. Beyond that there are scenes, which consist of different pattern chains, which can themselves be chained together to create full arrangements.</p><p>When creating patterns you can also introduce variation and unpredictability by using the probability parameter. This sets the chance that a particular step will be played. It’s not quite as robust as Elektron’s trig conditions, but it can keep things from getting too stale. And, if you’re feeling a bit stuck, you can “intelligently” remix a pattern with the Mutate function. It scrambles up your sequence to make something new, though the results aren’t always great and there’s no undo, so make sure to duplicate your pattern first. In general the Mutate felt more useful on the synth-based Circuit Tracks than on the Rhythm, but anything that can introduce a bit of randomness is good in my book.</p><section data-eng-breakout="7adbc7b93d1542d7934ec29a8cc08ccf" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44dbf4d1-eb32-11eb-bf3f-1dba5a22bd90" alt="Novation Circuit Rhythm"></section><p>While obviously the whole point of a sampler is to record and perform with your own samples, I do have to give Novation credit for the stock sound selection. Most of your bases are covered from acoustic drums, to 808s, to guitar licks, electric piano and synth pads. And they sound good too, which is not something you could say about the presets on the Circuit Tracks. Basically, no matter what genre of music you make, there should be enough here to get you started.</p><p>While the basic workflow of the Circuit Rhythm and Tracks are basically identical, there are some differences. There are specific pages for recording and processing samples, for instance, and a page dedicated to what Novation calls “Grid FX”, which are basically punch-in effects like repeat, gate and vinyl simulation that give you basic tools for manipulating your beat.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44ed8100-eb32-11eb-bcdb-be1975e22832" alt="Novation Circuit Rhythm" data-uuid="7c40b170-b406-3556-ac91-83a8922b0706"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>But, just like the Tracks, some of the more advanced features aren’t always immediately obvious and having the manual handy is a must while you’re finding your bearings. I’m sure that eventually I’d be able to commit most functions to memory, but after a few weeks I’m still having trouble remembering how to turn threshold on and off when recording samples, it took me forever to figure out how to manually place slice points, and I still haven’t figured out how to set a count-in for unquantized recording. (I’m not even sure you can.)</p><p>The effects are also something of a mixed bag here. The delay, reverb and sidechain effects are all the same as on the Tracks. They’re charmingly lo-fi, but the line between barely noticeable and over the top (especially on the sidechain) is <em>extremely</em> thin. And the Grid FX are pretty mediocre. The vinyl sim is passable, but the beat repeat and gate effects always felt slightly out of sync. It’s entirely likely that I just haven’t mastered performing with the Rhythm yet, but I don’t struggle nearly as much with the same effects on Teenage Engineering’s PO-33.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44db7fa2-eb32-11eb-bf9f-cbb3df787254" alt="Novation Circuit Rhythm" data-uuid="0dfe9012-c8f9-3cc3-88d1-09149126d39c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are some features that would be super useful too that I’m hoping to see Novation add in a future firmware update. For one, the ability to swap or adjust Grid FX from the device itself would be huge. You can load up to 16 of them, but they’re all presets, so you can’t change the depth of the flanger, for instance, without connecting to the Components app on your computer. This also means that if you start a new “Pack” on the Circuit (Novation’s term for a collection of projects and samples) you’re stuck with the default effects.</p><p>Fine-grained control over the tempo is also a must that’s currently missing. I spent well over an hour trying to line up a sample from “<a href="https://youtu.be/d48Q8J9VZIo">Stridulum Theme</a>” off the soundtrack to <em>The Visitor</em>, but no matter what I did I couldn’t quite get it to loop cleanly. The actual BPM of the sample is somewhere between 85 and 86 BPM, but the Rhythm will only deal in whole numbers. (It doesn’t help that without a screen, trimming a loop to the perfect length is a giant PITA.)</p><p>The Circuit Rhythm is far from perfect, but definitely offers a lot of compelling features at a decent price. The question, ultimately, is what features are most important to you?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44ecbdb0-eb32-11eb-bffb-8f65b74f43f7" alt="Novation Circuit Rhythm" data-uuid="6b951f5c-e5d4-35f6-b5f2-c69382fda61e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Model:Samples is $100 cheaper at $299 and its sequencer blows the Circuit out of the water, if you ask me. But it’s not as finger-drum friendly, plus it doesn’t have built-in sampling capabilities or a battery. (You have to pay <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elektron-power-handle-battery-model-samples-model-cycles-portable-grooveboxes-hands-on-133140497.html">$50 for a special handle</a> that you stick AAs in.) Korg’s <a href="https://www.korg.com/us/products/dj/electribe_sampler/index.php">Electribe Sampler</a> feels a lot sturdier than the Circuit and can use single-cycle waveforms to essentially become a synth. But it costs $70 more, its sequencer feels a little outdated and, in my limited experience, it’s just not intuitive.</p><p>You could of course go for a <a href="https://www.roland.com/us/products/sp-404a/">Roland SP-404</a>, from which the Rhythm is clearly takes inspiration. The modern version, the 404A, costs $550 — quite a bit more than then Circuit. It’s workflow might also feel a tad archaic if you’re used to more modern equipment. That being said, the SP-303 and SP-404 have legions of fans for a reason: They’re undeniable classics.</p><p>Then, of course, there’s the other giant of hip hop production: the MPC. As the cheapest option, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-15-akai-mpc-one-sampler-beat-production-namm.html">MPC One</a> is still pretty expensive at $699, while the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-live-ii-review-153032772.html">touchscreen workflow</a> has earned plenty of detractors. If you want an old-school beat-making experience you won’t find it here, and the prices for vintage MPCs are out of control.</p><p>If you’re looking for the cheapest and most portable device with sampling ability though, I can’t recommend the $89 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-03-teenage-engineering-po-33-ko-sampler.html">PO-33</a> enough. It’s not nearly as capable as any of the other devices listed here, but it can feel like a stripped-down SP-303 that fits in your pocket once you master its quirks.</p><section data-eng-breakout="3d10561b75d54180b159f4df79de675b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44db7fa0-eb32-11eb-b4b1-5eecc05f0dfd" alt="Novation Circuit Rhythm"></section><p>The Novation Circuit Rhythm is a strong contender for best entry-level sampler. The learning curve is a bit steeper than some might have you believe, but once you’ve figured it out, finding your way around is simple enough. It’s not the cheapest and it doesn’t beat the competition on pure features, but it does strike an admirable balance. If you’re looking to add a sampler to your setup on the cheap, or want to get started making hip hop or house music without the need for a PC, this should definitely be on your short list.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/circuit-rhythm-review-a-solid-and-affordable-sampler-groovebox-130026004.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ae5e510-4074-4167-a54c-97aef64034dd</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 13:00:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627305894</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T13:25:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44eda810-eb32-11eb-befd-2b099040bcd6" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44ecbdb1-eb32-11eb-ad6f-51f9f1a6a517" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Novation Circuit Rhythm]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Novation Circuit Rhythm]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best Apple AirTag accessories you can buy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple lovers who constantly lose their keys got a new way to keep track of them with the launch of AirTags. But despite how <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">easy they are to set up</a>, Apple’s tiny Bluetooth trackers have one critical flaw — no built-in keychain hole. That means anyone who buys AirTags will have to buy holders or cases to attach them to their stuff.</p><p>Despite how backwards this seems, it’s a very Apple way of milking as much money out of a new product as possible since many will simply buy Apple’s own AirTag holders. But those aren’t the only options available — plenty of accessory companies have already made AirTag cases. However, since the trackers are still quite new, third-party options are a bit slim. But those that are available right now are almost all cheaper than Apple’s own cases, so they’re worth considering regardless of if you intend to have one or many AirTags shadowing your valuables.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you already bought an <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirTag" href="https://amzn.to/3iEQ5hQ">AirTag</a> or two, you probably know where you want to put it. The most common place is attached to your keys, but AirTags are small enough to strap to backpacks and luggage, to slip inside a wallet or even attach to your pet’s collar. Where you want to put the thing will help determine the kind of case you should get for it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/bc08ea40-ea56-11eb-bf3e-88657663f480" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Apple AirTag with cases" data-uuid="28823c01-0d8b-3b06-8cf8-ca506cb9c3fb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>Let’s start with key-friendly cases, specifically Apple’s own <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM073ZM/A/airtag-leather-key-ring-forest-green?">$35 Leather Key Ring</a>. Like most Apple accessories it’s basic, yet attractive. The AirTag nestles into the perfectly-shaped leather circle and snaps shut, and since the leather extends slightly over both sides of the tracker, there’s very little chance it will pop out unexpectedly.</p><p>But unless you simply <em>must</em> have all Apple everything, you can get similar leather (or faux-leather) key holders for less. I liked <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Spigen&#x002019;s AirTag Case Valentinus" href="https://amzn.to/3xN6wir">Spigen’s AirTag Case Valentinus</a> because it has an almost identical design and comes with an easy to use carabiner-style key ring. It’s made of pleather but doesn’t feel cheap and its snap closure is just as secure as Apple’s — plus, it’s $15 cheaper.</p><p>Two other all-purpose key rings that stood out were <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Elago&#x002019;s AirTag case" href="https://amzn.to/3kohmHB">Elago’s AirTag case</a> ($9 for a pack of two) and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Caseology&#x002019;s $14 Vault" href="https://amzn.to/3ihjyy0">Caseology’s $14 Vault</a>. The former is quite minimal — it’s a soft-touch silicone circle that’s larger than the AirTag itself, which gives you a better grip on the tracker. One side of the gadget is completely covered by the case, as is the whole circumference. But that leaves one side visible, which means you can show off any emoji engravings you emblazoned on your AirTag. Elago’s case is the best no-frills option that I found when it comes to design and price.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM073ZM/A/airtag-leather-key-ring-forest-green?">Buy leather key ring at Apple - $35</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Spigen Valentinus at Amazon - $18" href="https://amzn.to/3xN6wir">Buy Spigen Valentinus at Amazon - $18</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Elago case (2 pack) at Amazon - $9" href="https://amzn.to/3kohmHB">Buy Elago case (2 pack) at Amazon - $9</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Caseology Vault at Amazon - $14" href="https://amzn.to/3ihjyy0">Buy Caseology Vault at Amazon - $14</a></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ff242ce0-ea56-11eb-bf1d-1b5b2f7ef5f5" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Apple AirTag with Caseology Vault" data-uuid="062ff7de-237c-36d6-a34a-84b44bd0a15d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>But if you want something a bit more elevated, Caseology’s Vault is a great option. It’s a textured oval made of flexible plastic into which you pop in the AirTag on one side. The other side has a smaller opening that attaches to the included carabiner, which is one of the best clips I came across in my testing. It’s pretty basic as far as carabiners go, but it’s better than a standard key ring — especially if you want to easily attach your AirTag to something other than your keys like straps on a backpack, or even a pet collar. Overall, the Caseology Vault is one of the most attractive holders I tested and it will be a solid buy for anyone that doesn’t <em>need </em>to have leather.</p><p>AirTags can also help you keep track of larger bags and luggage, and you could easily slip one into an interior pocket and call it a day. But if you’d rather hook the tracker to the outside, you’ll need something a bit larger and more flexible than a standard key ring. Apple has Loop holders in <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM043ZM/A/airtag-leather-loop-baltic-blue?">leather</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0W3ZM/A/airtag-loop-sunflower?">polyurethane</a> that attach similar to luggage tags, but they’re just as expensive as AirTags themselves starting at $29.</p><p>A more affordable option is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Belkin&#x002019;s Secure Holder with Strap" href="https://amzn.to/3kvAH9V">Belkin’s Secure Holder with Strap</a>, which comes in at only $13. The case opens up into two pieces, allowing you to sit the AirTag inside the circle and twist and snap the two halves together to lock it in. You can then attach the AirTag to your luggage handle, water bottle or other item with the strap, which lacks any give and feels quite strong. I appreciate the unique design of Belkin’s Secure Holder, although it was hard to twist open when the AirTag was inside of it. But that’s a good thing for daily use — your AirTag isn’t going anywhere when in the Secure Holder. I also liked its slightly raised edges, which provide extra protection against impacts and bumps.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK0W3ZM/A/airtag-loop-sunflower?">Buy loop holder at Apple starting at $29</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Belkin Secure Holder w/ Strap at Amazon - $13" href="https://amzn.to/3kvAH9V">Buy Belkin Secure Holder w/ Strap at Amazon - $13</a></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/da7c2c30-ea56-11eb-be7f-f84d24c8540b" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Apple AirTag with Belkin Secure Holder and Strap" data-uuid="977ab0c6-280a-39c6-b459-080d8a8a201a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>You may also want to slip an AirTag in your wallet, and you could do so without a case on the tracker at all. But unlike <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Tile&#x002019;s slim and flat locators" href="https://amzn.to/3enIUZN">Tile’s slim and flat locators</a>, AirTags are slightly rounded in the middle, so they won’t lay flat in the folds of your wallet. If that’s going to bother you, Amazon has a bunch of listings for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:credit card-sized AirTag holders" href="https://amzn.to/3edW8sl">credit card-sized AirTag holders</a> which keep the tracker secure in a circular cutout while also keeping your wallet at a relatively uniform thickness.</p><p>I wasn’t able to try any of these so I can’t vouch for their quality, but I will say they are a tailored solution to a very specific problem — these cases are designed for in-wallet use and that’s basically it. For more flexibility, you could opt for a thinner pocket for your AirTag like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Moment&#x002019;s $20 Stretch Fabric Mount" href="https://fave.co/2UiEP2q">Moment’s $20 Stretch Fabric Mount</a> or the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:$16 Cyrill Shine case" href="https://amzn.to/3z9rubh">$16 Cyrill Shine case</a>, the latter of which also doubles as a key ring holder.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, companies followed the same track with AirTags accessories as they did for AirPods accessories — there are many cute and custom options available. Casetify has a limited selection of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:customizable AirTag holders" href="https://casetify.hyyc7q.net/mgzdYZ">customizable AirTag holders</a> that you can emblazon with hearts, butterflies, peace signs and even the initials or name of the owner. But they’ll cost you $35 a pop — even pricier than a single AirTag. Amazon and Walmart also have silicone cases shaped like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:paw prints" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=buyersguide2021&amp;subId3=AirTags-pawprint&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FCase-Airtag-Silicone-Cat-Paw-3D-Cute-Protective-Airtags-Holder-Cover-Skin-Anti-Scratch-Keyring-Keychain-Key-Pet-Wallet-Bluetooth-Finder-Locator-Black%2F295022301%3Fselected%3Dtrue">paw prints</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hello Kitty" href="https://amzn.to/3z44s5M">Hello Kitty</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:kawaii avocados" href="https://amzn.to/3ksORZA">kawaii avocados</a> and more, and you’ll be hard pressed to find one of those costing more than $10.

Sony, which boasts a movie production arm, is already using its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-crystal-led-055541107.html">modular crystal LEDs</a> to provide backgrounds for shoots. Now, Samsung is getting in on the act through a new <a href="https://news.samsung.com/uk/samsung-to-build-first-virtual-production-studio-with-cj-enm-leveraging-leading-display-technology">partnership</a> with major Korean movie and TV show producer CJ ENM.</p><p>The pact will see Samsung provide its massive MicroLED TVs, known as The Wall, to the studio&#39;s virtual production facility when it opens in Paju, Gyeonggi Province later this year. CJ ENM previously struck a deal with <em>Fortnite </em>maker Epic Games to use its Unreal Engine game engine — which also provided the digital backdrops for <em>The Mandalorian</em> — for future projects.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Virtual productions are gaining traction in global filmmaking. The technique involves the use of LED stages, game engines and VR to create and control computer-generated backdrops. Currently, the massive investment has limited the tools to blockbuster shoots, but industry insiders believe that could change as people realize the savings they bring on crew travel and physical sets and infrastructure. As a result, virtual production is expected to become the norm in filmmaking within five years, according to an industry <a href="https://goteborgfilmfestival.se/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/GFF21-nostradamus-web-pages-210204-2.pdf">report</a> by the Göteborg Film Festival.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung says its latest screens will deliver improved visuals thanks to their support for HDR 10+ and optimized frame rates such as 23.976Hz, 29.97Hz and 59.94Hz. The company will install an oval-shaped main display at CJ ENM&#39;s new complex with a diameter of 20 metres and a height of seven metres or more. Samsung says its massive screen measures over 1,000 inches and supports up to 16K high-resolution content.</p><p>But, the Korean company hasn&#39;t embraced virtual production quite like Sony. The Japanese conglomerate previously paid $250 million to acquire a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-invests-250-million-fortnite-developer-epic-games-184430527.html">minority stake</a> in Epic Games. It also bought virtual production software maker <a href="https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2019/0709/sonypicturesacquiresvirtualproductionsoftwarecompanynurulize">Nurulize</a> in 2019 and integrated it into Sony Innovation Studios, the state-of-the-art facility located on the Sony Pictures Studios lot.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-wall-virtual-movie-studio-121524064.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4f258365-6df2-4ae3-b9d3-4e5eeb5db3b2</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 12:15:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627302668</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T12:31:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/aaf496f0-ee07-11eb-be5f-44a95e47fd96" width="4359" height="2724" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/aaf496f0-ee07-11eb-be5f-44a95e47fd96" width="4359" height="2724" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
