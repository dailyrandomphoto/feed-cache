Prior to that, she was director of the PR agency OutCast that counted Facebook and Oculus as clients.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Numerous rumors have surfaced about Apple&#39;s potential AR headset, some conflicting. One <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-requirement-chip-175931492.html">recent one</a> speculated that the headset might depend on another device like an iPhone or a Mac computer. Another from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-price-specs-rumor-145412503.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJ3CSOrktQLKkYcbb8dKKMBreo0MLeAZ7Qa92KV_jGSGGfSVYxFIL2iosZrmQaxyNmOyEoMHsHIemlbM-pJTLGkxJ0Y64aHXw-KCrpql58NsH1cfMQFL9WVmV8bKpGeXe4myTijbxFVlC3MOe9Wzmvkax2aggW7LW7XG874u2zYJ"><em>The Information</em></a> stated that it would be a standalone device with dual 8K displays that could cost up to $3,000. And a third rumor, this one from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-vr-games-160752822.html">Gurman</a>, indicated that it would play &quot;high-quality VR games.&quot; Gurman also stated that Apple may follow up the VR headset with AR-only glasses, but that would happen &quot;years down the road.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the sources agree that the headset will launch in 2022 or 2023, however. If that&#39;s the case, Apple will need to muster an impressive information campaign to educate the public on what it is and how it will work. The fact that the company has reportedly hired away the PR lead from Meta, the current leader in virtual and augmented reality, could confirm that the product is on track so far.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-hires-metas-ar-public-relations-lead-091431457.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">da81cf81-80e2-4b3d-811b-65199a991b52</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2021 09:14:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640596486</ingested><modified>2021-12-27T09:14:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/64bf5410-d430-11e9-bfda-78b49a0cf65f" width="4590" height="3344" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/64bf5410-d430-11e9-bfda-78b49a0cf65f" width="4590" height="3344" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Lam / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Craig Federighi, Senior Vice President Software Engineering speaks about "Augmented Reality" during Apple's annual world wide developer conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California, U.S. June 5, 2017.

They’re the sisters at the heart of Riot Games’ hit Netflix series, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html"><em>Arcane</em></a>, and they were picked for the spotlight out of a lineup of more than 150 <em>League of Legends </em>champions.</p><p>For <em>Arcane </em>creators Christian Linke and Alex Yee, the stars really couldn’t have been anyone else from <em>League of Legends</em> lore. Especially not Teemo. Linke and Yee have been preparing Jinx and Vi for their leading roles in a mature, mainstream, animated TV series for the past nine years, even if they didn’t know it the entire time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fad7f184b1fb41d4976f57dc602b07d4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/32oT-CWJOC0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Back in December 2012, Vi debuted and became the first <em>League of Legends</em> champion to receive a login screen complete with an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEXoT9RMZ2E">original, lyrical song</a>. A year later, Jinx joined the game’s ranks and starred in its first character-driven cinematic, a high-energy music video called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nlJuwO0GDs"><em>Get Jinxed</em></a>. Linke and Yee worked on both of these releases, flexing their creative muscles in music and narrative storyboarding, two aspects that didn’t get much attention in the core game-development process.</p><p>The Jinx cinematic was also the first time Riot partnered with Fortiche Production, the studio behind <em>Arcane</em>’s otherworldly animation style.</p><p>“They kind of got our special treatment already because we just really liked them,” Linke told Engadget. “And so, when we had to think about like, which characters do we want to stick with for many years to come? I think it was pretty obvious.”</p><p>Yee agreed and added, “Both of them were a bit of a milestone, I think, for our time at Riot.”</p><div id="6e469dce6ea042968b9f787b060f79b5"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0nlJuwO0GDs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In-game, Jinx and Vi are sisters and bitter enemies, though this story fades into the background of the action, appearing only in small voice lines and character descriptions. As an online MOBA, narrative isn’t critical to the way <em>League of Legends</em> plays, but Riot has infused its champions with more lore over the years, focusing on expanding their universe beyond the game launcher.</p><p>Nowadays, Riot is a hub of creative development across multiple mediums, including short stories, graphic novels, cinematics, music videos and one truly fantastic K-pop group. <em>Arcane </em>is the studio’s biggest push onto a mainstream service, and Jinx and Vi carry the story, surrounded by a handful of other champions, including Caitlyn, Jayce and Viktor, and other original characters.</p><p>Jinx and Vi were always intriguing to Linke and Yee. They were grounded in a way that the game’s more fantastical champions weren’t, with distinct, opposing personalities and an unexplained rivalry that clearly cut both sisters to the core. Vi was a powerful, rigid Enforcer working for the prosperous city of Piltover, while Jinx was an anarchist with a belt full of bombs and no filter. Vi’s hair is short and pink, while Jinx’s is long and bright blue.</p><p>“If you just imagine those two characters together in a scene, whatever location, whatever they would be debating – you know, what kind of food they&#39;re going to get in the evening, or what kind of movie they&#39;re going to watch,” Linke said. “It&#39;s just always going to be fun, because they&#39;re always going to have these very different perspectives.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="b7780f86486844919a8bd7589f19b954" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5aaf4e60-3dc6-11ec-afde-a0a390e44a96" alt="Arcane"></section><p>There’s an inherent question in Jinx and Vi’s shared backstory, Yee said, and it’s a mystery that fans of the game and newcomers to the show would be able to grasp quickly: If they’re sisters, why do they hate each other so much? <em>Arcane </em>asks that question and slowly answers it, providing a rich, emotionally charged origin story for Jinx, Vi and their surrounding champions along the way.</p><p>“The fact that Jinx and Vi’s relationship is a bit of a mystery from the outset allows us to sort of satisfy both audiences,” Yee said.</p><p>In <em>Arcane</em>, Linke and Yee were able to zoom in and focus on the small details that bring their characters to life, showing micro-expressions and all-consuming rage on Jinx’s face, or giving Vi a nuanced nervous tick, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html">bouncing her leg</a>. Fortiche Production, the studio that handles animation duties for <em>Arcane </em>and other Riot projects, was a pivotal part of this development process. Animators there were given leeway to express themselves in the characters, Linke said, and this resulted in a unique visual style that flowed like motion-capture, even though it was completely hand-drawn.</p><p>“We also tried to really treat the animators like actors who can find their ways of expressing things, rather than just kind of saying, make Jinx or Vi do this,” Linke said. “But instead, just being like, here&#39;s what&#39;s going on in their head, how can we really make that feel real?”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cec27fe0-642a-11ec-be3e-505c52e2c32b" alt="Arcane" data-uuid="a9d0d2a4-0021-3cef-8964-5c77e5772858"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Riot Games</div></figure><p>After nearly 10 years of in-game development and cross-media projects, Jinx and Vi are still able to surprise Linke and Yee. Developing <em>Arcane</em>, for instance, marked the first time they’d seen any <em>League of Legends</em> champion actually speaking, mouth movements and all.</p><p>“When we did our first trial, or our first test animatic for the show, it was the first time we&#39;d ever seen any of our champions talk,” Yee said. “We&#39;d never – their mouths don&#39;t move in game, you know. So it was a very funny milestone to cross at that point.”</p><p>Given how well <em>Arcane </em>has been received by <em>League of Legends</em> fans and newcomers alike, there are plenty more creative milestones to come as Riot continues its ride into mainstream entertainment. Season two of <em>Arcane</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu9HTOIUxLk">is in production</a> as we — and Jinx and Vi — speak.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arcane-jinx-vi-interview-league-legends-riot-netflix-170027289.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5fb77e7d-90b2-46b5-9ce7-6cc289d6150d</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 17:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640290728</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T20:19:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cec20ab0-642a-11ec-adbf-d93b80b37014" width="1370" height="771" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cec20ab0-642a-11ec-adbf-d93b80b37014" width="1370" height="771" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arcane]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arcane]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to set up your new Apple Watch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like many Apple products, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Watch" href="https://amzn.to/3saa3Ht">Apple Watch</a> can be extremely simple to start using — but that simplicity hides a surprising level of depth and customization. If you just received an Apple Watch, there’s a lot to do to make sure you’re getting the most out of your new wearable. Let us guide you through that process, from initial setup to optimizing everything it can do.</p><h2>Setup</h2><p>Of course, the first thing you’ll want to do is pair your Apple Watch with your iPhone. Even if you have a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:cellular-capable Apple Watch" href="https://amzn.to/3J16Y2H">cellular-capable Apple Watch</a>, an iPhone is required for setting up and managing the device. Fortunately, this process is extremely straightforward — after powering on the Apple Watch, just place it near an unlocked iPhone and you’ll get a prompt to set the device up. During this process, your iPhone will walk you through the initial pairing as well as signing in with your Apple ID, assigning a passcode to your Watch, setting up things like Siri and Apple Pay, and deciding if you want to transfer your compatible apps to the Watch. I recommend against transferring all your apps automatically this first time, as the Watch is a lot more useful when you curate it with only what you <em>need</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/65a446d0-5f50-11ec-93df-91c4c5e63f67" alt="Apple Watch notifications" data-uuid="1ff7f25c-0927-3fd1-a90d-cb1c987441d8"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>A few features you definitely should set up are fall detection and emergency SOS. The latter lets you quickly place a call to local emergency services by pressing and holding the side button, while fall detection uses the Watch’s accelerometers and other sensors to, well, detect if you’ve taken a bad spill. It’ll initiate an emergency SOS call automatically if it detects a fall and doesn’t detect you moving. Before making that call, the Watch will try its best to get your attention via a notification, a vibration and an audible alarm.</p><h2>The fun part: tweaking apps and notifications</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed648510-2c26-11ec-9fdf-6858672c9558" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" data-uuid="3230d43e-c6c7-3d6c-a561-ba7d52b65502"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Once you have the basics set up, it’s time to make the Apple Watch your own. By default, the Apple Watch mirrors all notifications that go to your phone. But I’ve found the Watch to be much more useful with a bit of curation. In the iPhone Watch app, you can customize notifications for all of Apple’s first-party apps, or turn them off entirely. For example, the Activity app notifications panel lets you choose whether or not you want reminders to stand every hour, or notifications when your friends share activity milestones with you and so forth.</p><p>Third-party apps don’t have the same granularity, but you can turn them off so they won’t ping your Watch. For things that aren’t particularly time-sensitive (say, updates from Google Photos, or if you don’t want the Apple News app overloading your wrist), feel free to turn them off. They’ll still hit your iPhone, and you can always enable them again later.</p><p>The iPhone Watch app also lets you pick which specific apps from your iPhone will be installed on the Apple Watch. I think this is more useful than just letting the Watch install every single compatible app, because that might mean you have a few dozen apps to sift through on your Watch to see if they’re useful or not. Instead, I prefer going through the list and deciding if there’s a benefit to having these apps on my wrist. In the case of apps like Google Maps or Ecobee for controlling my thermostat, it’s a definite yes. But things like Etsy or Bank of America don’t exactly make a ton of sense on a Watch. And if you ever change your mind, you can remove an app from the Watch app or by long-pressing it in grid view and deleting it – just keep in mind that this will remove the app from your Watch but not from your iPhone.</p><p>That said, I have been surprised at what some developers have envisioned for the Apple Watch. Take the notes app Bear, for example. I often use it to make grocery lists, and checklists show up great on the Apple Watch. So if there’s an app on your phone that you consider essential, give it a shot on the Watch.</p><h2>Watch faces</h2><p>Another occasionally-overlooked part of the Apple Watch experience are watch faces. Since this is literally what you’ll see every time you raise your wrist, I think it’s worth finding ones that fit your personal style. While there are no third-party faces, the Apple Watch has more than 30 built-in options that are endlessly customizable. We’re talking about a huge variety of colors, different typefaces and watch face styles, complications (small slices of info like weather, date, or music controls) and much more. You can have a simple digital time display with nothing else, or an info-dense face with eight different complications or anything in between.</p><p>You can set up new faces on the Watch directly — but as with most in-depth features, it’s easier to do this on the iPhone. The Face Gallery shows every available face, along with multiple examples of how they can be customized. You can use those as a jumping off point to make your own creations. Once you’ve curated your favorites, you can simply swipe through them on the Watch itself when you want to mix things up. If you long press on a face, you can edit it directly on your Watch too, which is handy when you want to just change the color quickly to better match your outfit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/120c76d0-5f4d-11ec-ab3e-59df7abc5955" alt="Apple Watch faces" data-uuid="47e7f3a8-8998-3594-bd04-3f98828397d9"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re using an Apple Watch Series 5, 6 or 7, you can also decide whether you want to activate the always-on display. You can find this option in the settings app, under “Display &amp; Brightness.” If you’re after maximum battery life, turn this off, but most people will probably prefer it on. New watches can still get a full day of use while using the always-on feature, but once your watch ages a bit and battery performance degrades, you might want to learn to live without it.</p><h2>Fitness tracking</h2><p>One of the biggest Apple Watch selling points is its fitness-tracking features. Whether or not you actively exercise on a regular basis, the Watch will track your steps and activity level, and use that data to track your daily movement via three rings that you’re encouraged to close. The “move” ring is how many active calories you burn in a day, the “exercise” ring tracks activity at or above a brisk walk, and the “stand” ring tracks whether or not you get up and move for a minute or two each hour of the day.</p><p>When you set up your Apple Watch, it’ll suggest daily goals for each of these, and the Activity app (or the Fitness app on your iPhone) will show how close you are to hitting them. If you’ve never used an Apple Watch before, it’s fine to just go with the defaults — every week, you’ll get a recap of how you did and it’ll even suggest bumping up your Move number if you’re easily surpassing it. The exercise and stand options default to 30 minutes per day and 12 hours per day, but those too can be adjusted.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/68b1b540-5f4d-11ec-a59a-4faf9cf1e6c3" alt="Apple Watch fitness" data-uuid="528d4bb8-2e73-33fd-aea3-11545b06cefc"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>For extra motivation, the Fitness app lets you connect with other friends who use an Apple Watch and see how much progress they’re making against their three rings. Naturally, you can use this information to taunt them about their couch-potato habits, but you can also challenge them to informal competitions. You earn points based on the percentage you close each of your rings every day, and the person with the most points after a week wins. It’s pretty casual, but it’s also a fun way to stay motivated.</p><p>If you want to track a specific workout, like a run, walk, or weight-training session you do that in the “workout” app. There, you’ll find the many different types of workouts that the Watch can track. If you already have a favorite way to track exercise on your phone, though, chances are you can find it for the Apple Watch too. Nike Run Club, MapMyRun, Peloton and others all have Watch apps that let you track workouts using the wearable’s sensors. Also, a lot of apps can now connect with the Health app on your iPhone. It’s a database of all your activity and workout data from your Watch, so you might be able to easily sync workout data from there into your service of choice. As with most things Apple Watch, it’ll just take a bit of playing around to see what works best for you.</p><h2>Music</h2><p>One of my favorite things about the Apple Watch is that it can stream music and podcasts – not just from Apple’s services but others like Spotify and Pandora as well. You’ll need a cellular-capable Watch to stream music without your phone, but the good news is that Apple Music, Spotify and Pandora all allow you to save music directly on the Watch as well. Regardless of whether you spring for the cellular model or not, there’s a way to listen to tunes and leave your phone behind.</p><p>If you’re an Apple Music user, you’ll manage downloaded music through the Watch app on your iPhone. Pop that open and go to the “Music” section and you’ll see a big button to add songs to your watch. There’s also a setting that’ll automatically download albums and playlists you’ve listened to recently – turn that on and you’ll always have some music on your wrist.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/14dc89f0-5f51-11ec-beff-76085033b240" alt="Apple Watch music" data-uuid="87e8579d-9aa3-3ac5-9b8a-6a88a485c81a"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It’s easy to choose specific albums or playlists you want saved, too. Just hit the big plus button and you’ll see your Apple Music library. From there, just navigate to what you want, hit another plus button and it’ll be downloaded to your Watch. Note that music only transfers when your Watch is charging, so you’ll need to take it off your wrist to sync.</p><p>If you’re using Spotify, just navigate to an album, playlist or podcast on your phone and tap the three dots icon – you’ll see an option to “download to Apple Watch” there. Then, on your watch, there’s a clearly-marked “downloads” section where you can play content without a connection.</p><h2>Experiment, experiment, experiment!</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b370030-2b97-11ec-b7f3-7e614289c1b4" alt="The all apps page in grid view on the Apple Watch Series 7." data-uuid="8da67b38-07aa-3973-a561-f883c426c7b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Like many Apple products, the Apple Watch has a lot of functionality and hidden complexity beneath its user-friendly surface. But I’ve found that the Watch hides a lot of features, so it’s worth checking out the built-in Tips app for suggestions on what you can do. Without a guide like that, you’ll probably never realize that clicking the side button twice summons Apple Pay, or that you can display the grid of icons in a list if you prefer. Chances are good you’re not going to irrevocably mess something up, so tap and swipe and scroll and dig into the settings.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-set-up-your-new-apple-watch-150031548.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c12825f-1c7c-42a2-af55-02ab1d02351b</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 26 Dec 2021 15:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640105120</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T16:45:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9761caa0-2b96-11ec-bffd-fddd7431d5dc" width="1900" height="1267" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9761caa0-2b96-11ec-bffd-fddd7431d5dc" width="1900" height="1267" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An off-angle view of the Apple Watch Series 7 on a person's wrist, showing the screen's refracted edge and the watch's dial and button.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: Amiga and the birth of 256-color gaming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With modern consoles offering gamers graphics so photorealistic that they blur the line between CGI and reality, it&#39;s easy forget just how cartoonishly blocky they were in the 8-bit era.

In the excerpt below, Davis explains how the industry made its technological leap from 8- to 12-bit graphics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/52bfe620-3dac-11ec-bb7f-2ca9252fc43d" alt="qbert" data-uuid="6878a9f0-0a21-345e-af42-28e8f8b7151f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Santa Monica Press</div></figure><p>©2021 Santa Monica Press</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>Back at my regular day job, I became particularly fascinated with a new product that came out for the Amiga computer: a video digitizer made by a company called A-Squared. Let’s unpack all that slowly.</p><p>The Amiga was a recently released home computer capable of unprecedented graphics and sound: 4,096 colors! Eight-bit stereo sound! There were image manipulation programs for it that could do things no other computer, including the IBM PC, could do. We had one at Williams not only because of its capabilities, but also because our own Jack Haeger, an immensely talented artist who’d worked on Sinistar at Williams a few years earlier, was also the art director for the Amiga design team.</p><p>Video digitization is the process of grabbing a video image from some video source, like a camera or a videotape, and converting it into pixel data that a computer system (or video game) could use. A full-color photograph might contain millions of colors, many just subtly different from one another. Even though the Amiga could only display 4,096 colors, that was enough to see an image on its monitor that looked almost perfectly photographic.</p><p>Our video game system still could only display 16 colors total. At that level, photographic images were just not possible. But we (and by that I mean everyone working in the video game industry) knew that would change. As memory became cheaper and processors faster, we knew that 256-color systems would soon be possible. In fact, when I started looking into digitized video, our hardware designer, Mark Loffredo, was already playing around with ideas for a new 256-color hardware system.</p><p>Let’s talk about color resolution for a second. Come on, you know you want to. No worries if you don’t, though, you can skip these next few paragraphs if you like. Color resolution is the number of colors a computer system is capable of displaying. And it’s all tied in to memory. For example, our video game system could display 16 colors. But artists weren’t locked into 16 specific colors. The hardware used a “palette.” Artists could choose from a fairly wide range of colors, but only 16 of them could be saved in the palette at any given time. Those colors could be programmed to change while a game was running. In fact, changing colors in a palette dynamically allowed for a common technique used in old video games called “color cycling.”</p><p>For the hardware to know what color to display at each pixel location, each pixel on the screen had to be identified as one of those 16 colors in the palette. The collection of memory that contained the color values for every pixel on the screen was called “screen memory.” Numerically, it takes 4 bits (half a byte) to represent 16 numbers (trust me on the math here), so if 4 bits = 1 pixel, then 1 byte of memory could hold 2 pixels. By contrast, if you wanted to be able to display 256 colors, it would take 8 bits to represent 256 numbers. That’s 1 byte (or 8 bits) per pixel.</p><p>So you’d need twice as much screen memory to display 256 colors as you would to display 16. Memory wasn’t cheap, though, and game manufacturers wanted to keep costs down as much as possible. So memory prices had to drop before management approved doubling the screen memory.</p><p>Today we take for granted color resolutions of 24 bits per pixel (which potentially allows up to 16,777,216 colors and true photographic quality). But back then, 256 colors seemed like such a luxury. Even though it didn’t approach the 4,096 colors of the Amiga, I was convinced that such a system could result in close to photo-realistic images. And the idea of having movie-quality images in a video game was very exciting to me, so I pitched to management the advantages of getting a head start on this technology. They agreed and bought the digitizer for me to play around with.</p><p>The Amiga’s digitizer was crude. Very crude. It came with a piece of hardware that plugged into the Amiga on one end, and to the video output of a black-and-white surveillance camera (sold separately) on the other. The camera needed to be mounted on a tripod so it didn’t move. You pointed it at something (that also couldn’t move), and put a color wheel between the camera and the subject. The color wheel was a circular piece of plastic divided into quarters with different tints: red, green, blue, and clear.</p><p>When you started the digitizing process, a motor turned the color wheel very slowly, and in about thirty to forty seconds you had a full-color digitized image of your subject. “Full-color” on the Amiga meant 4 bits of red, green, and blue—or 12-bit color, resulting in a total of 4,096 colors possible.</p><p>It’s hard to believe just how exciting this was! At that time, it was like something from science fiction. And the coolness of it wasn’t so much how it worked (because it was pretty damn clunky) but the potential that was there. The Amiga digitizer wasn’t practical—the camera and subject needed to be still for so long, and the time it took to grab each image made the process mind-numbingly slow—but just having the ability to produce 12-bit images at all enabled me to start exploring algorithms for color reduction.</p><p>Color reduction is the process of taking an image with a lot of colors (say, up to the 16,777,216 possible colors in a 24-bit image) and finding a smaller number of colors (say, 256) to best represent that image. If you could do that, then those 256 colors would form a palette, and every pixel in the image would be represented by a number—an “index” that pointed to one of the colors in that palette. As I mentioned earlier, with a palette of 256 colors, each index could fit into a single byte.</p><p>But I needed an algorithm to figure out how to pick the best 256 colors out of the thousands that might be present in a digitized image. Since there was no internet back then, I went to libraries and began combing through academic journals and technical magazines, searching for research done in this area. Eventually, I found some! There were numerous papers written on the subject, each outlining a different approach, some easier to understand than others. Over the next few weeks, I implemented a few of these algorithms for generating 256 color palettes using test images from the Amiga digitizer. Some gave better results than others. Images that were inherently monochromatic looked the best, since many of the 256 colors could be allotted to different shades of a single color.</p><p>During this time, Loffredo was busy developing his 256-color hardware. His plan was to support multiple circuit boards, which could be inserted into slots as needed, much like a PC. A single board would give you one surface plane to draw on. A second board gave you two planes, foreground and background, and so on. With enough planes, and by having each plane scroll horizontally at a slightly different rate, you could give the illusion of depth in a side-scrolling game.</p><p>All was moving along smoothly until the day word came down that Eugene Jarvis had completed his MBA and was returning to Williams to head up the video department. This was big news! I think most people were pretty excited about this. I know I was, because despite our movement toward 256-color hardware, the video department was still without a strong leader at the helm. Eugene, given his already legendary status at Williams, was the perfect person to take the lead, partly because he had some strong ideas of where to take the department, and also due to management’s faith in him. Whereas anybody else would have to convince management to go along with an idea, Eugene pretty much had carte blanche in their eyes. Once he was back, he told management what we needed to do and they made sure he, and we, had the resources to do it.</p><p>This meant, however, that Loffredo’s planar hardware system was toast. Eugene had his own ideas, and everyone quickly jumped on board. He wanted to create a 256-color system based on a new CPU chip from Texas Instruments, the 34010 GSP (Graphics System Processor). The 34010 was revolutionary in that it included graphics-related features within its core. Normally, CPUs would have no direct connection to the graphics portion of the hardware, though there might be some co-processor to handle graphics chores (such as Williams’ proprietary VLSI blitter). But the 34010 had that capability on board, obviating the need for a graphics co-processor.</p><p>Looking at the 34010’s specs, however, revealed that the speed of its graphics functions, while well-suited for light graphics work such as spreadsheets and word processors, was certainly not fast enough for pushing pixels the way we needed. So Mark Loffredo went back to the drawing board to design a VLSI blitter chip for the new system.</p><p>Around this time, a new piece of hardware arrived in the marketplace that signaled the next generation of video digitizing. It was called the Image Capture Board (ICB), and it was developed by a group within AT&amp;T called the EPICenter (which eventually split from AT&amp;T and became Truevision). The ICB was one of three boards offered, the others being the VDA (Video Display Adapter, with no digitizing capability) and the Targa (which came in three different configurations: 8-bit, 16-bit, and 24-bit). The ICB came with a piece of software called TIPS that allowed you to digitize images and do some minor editing on them. All of these boards were designed to plug in to an internal slot on a PC running MS-DOS, the original text-based operating system for the IBM PC. (You may be wondering . . . where was Windows? Windows 1.0 was introduced in 1985, but it was terribly clunky and not widely used or accepted. Windows really didn’t achieve any kind of popularity until version 3.0, which arrived in 1990, a few years after the release of Truvision’s boards.)</p><p>A little bit of trivia: the TGA file format that’s still around today (though not as popular as it once was) was created by Truevision for the TARGA series of boards. The ICB was a huge leap forward from the Amiga digitizer in that you could use a color video camera (no more black-and-white camera or color wheel), and the time to grab a frame was drastically reduced—not quite instantaneous, as I recall, but only a second or two, rather than thirty or forty seconds. And it internally stored colors as 16-bits, rather than 12 like the Amiga. This meant 5 bits each of red, green, and blue—the same that our game hardware used—resulting in a true-color image of up to 32,768 colors, rather than 4,096. Palette reduction would still be a crucial step in the process. The greatest thing about the Truevision boards was they came with a Software Development Kit (SDK), which meant I could write my own software to control the board, tailoring it to my specific needs. This was truly amazing! Once again, I was so excited about the possibilities that my head was spinning.</p><p>I think it’s safe to say that most people making video games in those days thought about the future. We realized that the speed and memory limitations we were forced to work under were a temporary constraint. We realized that whether the video game industry was a fad or not, we were at the forefront of a new form of storytelling. Maybe this was a little more true for me because of my interest in filmmaking, or maybe not. But my experiences so far in the game industry fueled my imagination about what might come. And for me, the holy grail was interactive movies. The notion of telling a story in which the player was not a passive viewer but an active participant was extremely compelling. People were already experimenting with it under the constraints of current technology. Zork and the rest of Infocom’s text adventure games were probably the earliest examples, and more would follow with every improvement in technology. But what I didn’t know was if the technology needed to achieve my end goal—fully interactive movies with film-quality graphics—would ever be possible in my lifetime. I didn’t dwell on these visions of the future. They were just thoughts in my head. Yet, while it’s nice to dream, at some point you’ve got to come back down to earth. If you don’t take the one step in front of you, you can be sure you’ll never reach your ultimate destination, wherever that may be.</p><p>I dove into the task and began learning the specific capabilities of the board, as well as its limitations. With the first iteration of my software, which I dubbed WTARG (“W” for Williams, “TARG” for TARGA), you could grab a single image from either a live camera or a videotape. I added a few different palette reduction algorithms so you could try each and find the best palette for that image. More importantly, I added the ability to find the best palette for a group of images, since all the images of an animation needed to have a consistent look. There was no chroma key functionality in those early boards, so artists would have to erase the background manually. I added some tools to help them do that.</p><p>This was a far cry from what I ultimately hoped for, which was a system where we could point a camera at live actors and instantly have an animation of their action running on our game hardware. But it was a start.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-creating-qbert-and-other-classic-video-arcade-games-warren-davis-santa-monica-press-163011566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42f3d1c1-fecb-4ad5-acbb-85a35670f6dd</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 16:30:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638995207</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T20:27:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65c68760-3ccb-11ec-96fd-dba986d71ed1" width="7360" height="4912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65c68760-3ccb-11ec-96fd-dba986d71ed1" width="7360" height="4912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Detail of the logo on a vintage 1980's Commodore Amiga 500 personal computer and games console, taken on September 14, 2016.

Hopefully, we’ll get some more hints in the new year.</p><p>Not to be outdone, the Stellantis Group (formerly FCA and umbrella company to Chrysler, Jeep Dodge, Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Maserati and a host of others) <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/08/stellantis-to-invest-35point5-billion-in-evs-and-new-technologies-by-2025.html">announced in July</a> that it, too, will be investing $35 billion towards its electrification efforts through 2025 and will have 55 electrified vehicles (40 BEVs, 15 PHEVs) available in the US and European markets by the end of that year. What’s more, Stellantis is working on an all-electric Ram EV to compete with the Silverado and Ford F-150 Lightning, though the Ram isn’t expected to be released until 2024. For its part in 2021, Jeep showed off a slick-looking <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeeps-all-electric-wrangler-concept-has-a-six-speed-manual-transmission-122031458.html">Wrangler BEV concept in March</a>, released its “light hybrid” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-jeep-wrangler-unlimited-sahara-4-xe-phev-first-drive-174554804.html">Wrangler Sahara 4XE in May</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeep-2022-grand-cherokee-4xe-debut-september-29-173239673.html">debuted its PHEV Cherokee 4XE</a> in September ahead of the vehicle’s 2022 release.</p><p>Ford also had a year worthy of honking its own horn about, starting with the February release of the Mustang Mach-E. The EV was met with <a href="http://v/">a bit of trepidation to start</a> but cemented its position with the release of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mach-e-gt-hands-on-american-muscle-car-for-the-21st-century-100005360.html">performance-focused GT edition</a>. In all, Ford had sold more 21,000 Mach-E units through this past October, despite a handful of recalls for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mustang-mach-e-recall-222632366.html">loose bolts</a> and “deep sleeping” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-mustang-mach-e-battery-issue-212744852.html">software bugs</a>. That’s not bad for a first-year crossover SUV working to get past deeply ingrained customer nostalgia, but the Mach-E’s numbers are nothing compared to the hype Ford’s upcoming F-150 Lightning EV has garnered.</p><p>The company’s F-150 electrification efforts have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-electric-ford-f-150-tow-over-a-million-pounds.html">hardly been an industry secret</a> but when <a href="http://v/">Ford debuted the Lightning</a> on May 19th (or May 18th if you were watching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-ev-ford-biden-reveal-early-193001820.html">President Biden’s speech</a>), America’s car-buying public just about lost its mind with nearly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-pre-order-reservation-jim-farley-162653871.html">45,000 people signing up to preorder</a> the EV pickup within the first 48 hours.</p><div id="6a1621ebaf4146b4b0902711a82cd98b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">More than 44,500 reservations in less than 48 hours...and counting.

The <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/ford/2021/08/23/fords-small-maverick-pickup-generates-big-reservation-numbers/8240567002/"><em>Detroit News</em></a> reported in August that more than 100,000 people had allegedly signed up to preorder the mini-truck, a large portion of which were California residents. Granted, those folks weren’t obligated to place a down payment so whether all those pre-orders translate into actual sales — or folks just decide to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-electric-f100-eluminator-concept-truck-140543585.html">restomod their existing ICE Fords with the eluminator system</a> instead — remains to be seen.</p><p>Some of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-213828598.html">biggest headlines</a> in the 2021 EV truck space came from stellar startup, Rivian. While competitors like Lordstown Motors found themselves <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-232701777.html">critically low on cash</a> and the subject of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doj-investigation-lordstown-motors-184638125.html">Justice Department fraud investigations</a>, Rivian has already hit its first production milestone: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html">actually producing vehicles</a> (despite having to push its initial delivery window from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-r1s-suv-delivery-dates-151911858.html">July</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">September</a>). But that’s not the half of it.&nbsp;</p><p>This year, the company also announced plans to install 10,000 charging stations across <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-ev-charger-network-us-canada-2023-210428781.html">North America by 2023</a>, unveiled <a href="http://v/">a membership plan for owners</a> offering both Roadside and off-Roadside Assistance as well as exclusive OTA software updates, and outlined its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-ev-service-plan-143206646.html">Remote Care program</a> which would offer remote diagnoses and on-site repairs for the electric trucks. The startup has big plans for the future as well. It announced plans to invest $5 billion in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-second-factory-capacity-battery-cells-193825530.html">a second US-based production plant</a> and is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-uk-ev-factory-plans-193124496.html">reportedly eyeing the UK</a> as the site for its first international battery facility.</p><p>Some of those future plans will involve partnerships with other companies such as Amazon — which owns a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-20-percent-stake-rivian-185007669.html">20 percent stake in Rivian</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-jeff-bezos-amazon-climate-change-paris-agreement.html">purchased 100,000 vehicles from the startup in 2019</a> and has already begun making deliveries in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-san-francisco-141525649.html">San Francisco</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-vehicles-are-making-deliveries-in-la-132506234.html">Los Angeles</a> with them — but they won’t include Ford. Despite investing half a billion dollars in the EV startup two years ago, Ford announced in November that the two companies will no longer collaborate on an upcoming EV. Looks like that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lincoln-cancels-rivian-based-ev-004105043.html">rumored electric Lincoln</a> will likely stay dead for the time being.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/89b35c80-5313-11ec-bcf5-af21cdef94e2" style="height:2744;width:4800;" alt="The Rivian R1T arrives on stage as a 2022 Truck of the Year Finalist at the LA Auto Show in Los Angeles, California on November 17, 2021.

BROWN via Getty Images</div></figure><p>On the other end of the headline spectrum is, surprisingly, Tesla. Despite the company’s massively profitable year, the development of its Cybertruck has been slow going. While CEO Elon Musk announced in January that “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-2022-004217965.html">volume production</a>” of the EV SUV will begin in 2022, <a href="http://v/">it’s increasingly looking like</a> that will happen later in the year — after Ford’s F-150 Lightning and GMC’s Hummer EV hit the roads, both of which debuted well after the Cybertruck did.</p><p>Of course, American automakers are far from the only ones getting in on the EV game. Mercedes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-will-launch-the-eqb-electric-ev-in-the-us-in-2022-084031973.html">announced in April</a> that its EQB compact SUV is nearly ready for production and will go on sale in the US next year. Its “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-sustaineer-electric-delivery-van-concept-215050891.html">Sustainer</a>” delivery van concept, however, might take a bit longer to reach the market. Hyundai, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-striking-ioniq-5-delivers-long-range-and-brisk-performance-093212320.html">unveiled its Ioniq 5 SUV in February</a> with plans to release it this winter alongside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-genesis-brand-will-switch-entirely-to-electric-powertrains-in-2025-182802371.html">promises that its Genesis line of vehicles</a> will go entirely electric by the middle of this decade. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-2021-niro-ev-164152474.html">Kia’s Niro EV continues to be a low-key sleeper hit</a>.</p><p>We’ve seen much hype and grandiose promises about EV pickup trucks and SUVs over the last few years but 2022 will be the year when everything comes out in the wash. Consumers will finally be able to see these vehicles on the streets, in their neighborhoods, and likely breathing down their necks while stuck in traffic, rather than just on a showroom floor or livestream presentation stage. This is a huge opportunity for automakers to further evangelize the benefits of battery electrics over their internal combustion predecessors — this time using America’s favorite type of vehicle.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/2021-showed-us-that-trucks-and-suvs-dont-need-gas-engines-160020378.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ba3c234-f081-40cb-82b3-ca83c10e60c8</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 16:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640260359</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T11:52:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cee7cc00-6286-11ec-bffb-e5210c7dea1a" width="7380" height="4151" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cee7cc00-6286-11ec-bffb-e5210c7dea1a" width="7380" height="4151" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[2022 Ford F-150 Lightning Platinum.

It will take around a month to reach its destination, after which researchers will be able to peek into black holes, observe some of the oldest galaxies in the universe and evaluate the habitability of various exoplanets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NASA partnered with the European and Canadian space agencies to develop the project. The JSWT has been beset by delays throughout its long history. NASA initially hoped to launch it in 2007, but spiraling costs prompted engineers to re-think the telescope in 2005. The JSWT was then declared ready <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-07-nasa-has-completed-the-8-7-billion-james-webb-space-telescope.html">in 2016</a>, but the project was once again put on hold because of construction complications. The telescope was assembled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-james-web-telescope-assembled.html">in 2019</a>, but then the COVID-19 pandemic struck, leading to delays to testing and shipping.</p><p>After the JWST finally reached the spaceport, NASA set a launch date of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-145148575.html">December 18th</a>. However, it delayed the launch until today due to last-minute inspections and a lack of favorable weather. Still, what&#39;s a few days for such an important, long-in-the-works mission? The JWST is finally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/in-2021-billionaires-headed-to-the-stars-210013764.html">spacebound</a>, and in the coming months, we&#39;ll start to learn some of its discoveries.</p><div id="4a50182b90ba401a80585bae30870ee7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7nT7JGZMbtM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-123452649.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">415887ff-349f-47d0-8a28-20956352adda</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Dec 2021 12:34:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640435698</ingested><modified>2021-12-25T12:35:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b4ddee40-10ae-11ec-8edf-b89706fd9f91" width="6500" height="4224" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b4ddee40-10ae-11ec-8edf-b89706fd9f91" width="6500" height="4224" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[alex-mit via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb), 3d illustration, elements of this image are furnished by NASA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST or Webb), 3d illustration, elements of this image are furnished by NASA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch the James Webb Space Telescope launch at 7:20 AM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After far too many delays over the years to count, NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope has a launch date.

Last serviced in 2009, the telescope has had to enter the partial-shutdown “<a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/09/1020563/how-long-hubble-space-telescope-safe-mode-nasa/">safe mode</a>” multiple times over the last few years — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-hubble-telescope-is-operational-again-155710162.html">most recently, this October</a>. And while optimistic estimates suggest that the Hubble could remain in operation through the end of the decade, NASA, with its ESA and CSA partners, have already spent more than a dozen years developing a successor, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). When the Webb launches — currently set for liftoff on Christmas Day — it will take over as humanity’s preeminent eye in the sky for decades to come.</p><div id="6e44fa7e63df4dabafaf70403dc462ea"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O9ZlqWp7620?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The 7.2-ton JWST will be the largest telescope NASA has ever put into orbit. Its 6.5-meter primary mirror array — composed of 18 gold-plated hexagonal segments — is more than twice the size of the Hubble’s and nearly 60 times larger in area than <a href="https://www.spitzer.caltech.edu/">the Spitzer Telescope</a>, which retired in 2020. The sun shield it uses to protect its delicate infrared sensors is nearly as long as a tennis court, and the telescope apparatus as a whole stands three stories tall. The 458 gigabits of data collected daily will be first routed through NASA’s Deep Space Network, then transmitted to the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, Maryland, which will collate and disseminate that information to the greater astronomy community.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When it reaches its orbital home at the L2 Lagrange point 930,000 miles from Earth, the JWST will begin its four-point mission: searching for light from the earliest post-Big Bang stars; studying the formation and development of galaxies, examining the evolution of stars and planetary systems; and seeking out the origins of life.</p><div id="37f167ac56d344aa9b8bf8b0fd9e6bc7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YF22Ba-xrk8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>To do so, the Webb will take a different approach from the Hubble before it. While the Hubble looked at the universe in the visible and ultraviolet spectrums, the JWST will see in infrared, just as the Spitzer used to but with far greater resolution and clarity. Using this infrared is critical to the Webb’s mission as that wavelength can peer through clouds of interstellar gasses and dust to see otherwise obscured objects beyond.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0921b340-5f62-11ec-bbf2-2556ac2d15a1" alt="look, it&#39;s all bolted together." data-uuid="acc58bab-1faa-3ae8-a2e5-768aeb093cad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA/Chris Gunn</div></figure><p>The Webb’s camera suite is made up of four individual components: the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI), Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam), Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec), and the Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph/Fine Guidance Sensor (NIRISS/FGS). These instruments are actually so sensitive that they can detect their own heat radiation when they’re operating. To minimize these infrared emissions, three of the sensors are chilled to negative 388 degrees Fahrenheit (-233 degrees C). The especially sensitive MIRI is cooled even further to -448 degrees F (-266 degrees C) — that’s a mere 7 degrees Kelvin above absolute zero.</p><p>Getting the MIRI that cold is no easy feat. After the JWST makes its way into orbit, the telescope will spend weeks slowly chilling the sensor to its optimal operating temperature using a helium-based refrigeration system.</p><p>“It’s relatively easy to cool something down to that temperature on Earth, typically for scientific or industrial applications,” said JPL cryocooler specialist Konstantin Penanen in <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-webb-telescope-will-have-the-coolest-camera-in-space">a recent NASA blog post</a>. “But those Earth-based systems are very bulky and energy inefficient. For a space observatory, we need a cooler that is physically compact, highly energy efficient, and it has to be highly reliable because we can’t go out and repair it. So those are the challenges we faced, and in that respect, I would say the MIRI cryocooler is certainly at the cutting edge.”</p><p>The extra effort that MIRI requires will be well worth it as ground-based infrared telescopes — especially those operating within the mid-infrared spectrum as MIRI is, are largely hampered by heat emissions from the devices themselves and the surrounding atmosphere.</p><p>“With the other three instruments, Webb observes wavelengths up to 5 microns. Adding wavelengths out to 28.5 microns with MIRI really increases its range of science,” George Rieke, professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona, <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/12/09/webbs-mid-infrared-instrument-is-ready-for-launch/">said earlier this month in a NASA blog</a>. “This includes everything from studying protostars and their surrounding protoplanetary disks, the energy balance of exoplanets, mass loss from evolved stars, circumnuclear tori around the central black holes in active galactic nuclei, and a lot more.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d129b280-5f61-11ec-9fba-305db3f007d3" alt="the Webb sunshield" data-uuid="feaef2ac-b3de-34fb-af23-76b826824168"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure><p>Given the JWST’s highly specific low temperature needs, keeping the telescope’s sensor suite out of direct sunlight (and blocked from other light sources like the Moon and Earth) is crucial. To ensure that those cameras are perpetually shaded, NASA engineers have built <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/sunshield.html">a five-layer sunshield</a> made from aluminum-coated Kapton film to keep them in the cold, cold dark.</p><p>&quot;The shape and design also direct heat out the sides, around the perimeter, between the layers,&quot; said James Cooper, the JWST’s Sunshield Manager at Goddard Space Flight Center. &quot;Heat generated by the Spacecraft bus at the ‘core,’ or center, is forced out between the membrane layers so that it cannot heat up the optics.&quot;</p><p>Measuring 69.5 feet by 46.5 feet by .001 inches, the kite-shaped sun shield is stacked five layers high so that energy absorbed by the top layer radiates out into space between them, making each successive layer slightly cooler than the one above it. In fact, the temperature difference at the outermost (383K, or 230 degrees F) and innermost layers (36K, about -394 degrees F) is roughly an order of magnitude.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a912f0e0-5f61-11ec-bede-40e608af0fb3" alt="the JWST is much bigger" data-uuid="45b0c15f-8e09-373c-9565-1a4811dde88b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure><p>In order to collect enough light to view the fainest, most distant stars possible — some as far as 13 billion light years away — the JWST will rely on its massive 6.5m primary mirror array. Unlike the Hubble, which utilized a single 2.4m-wide mirror, the Webb’s mirror is divided into 18 individual segments, each weighing just 46 pounds thanks to their beryllium construction. They’re coated in gold to enhance their reflection of infrared light and hexagonal in shape so that, when fully assembled in orbit, they’ll fit together snugly enough to act as a single, symmetrical, gapless reflective plane. Their small size also allows them to easily be split up and folded down in order to fit within the tight confines of the Ariane 5 rocket they’ll ride into orbit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7a927dd0-5f61-11ec-b7fe-5953daf075b2" alt="The JWST aboard the Ariane 5" data-uuid="2d17469b-4832-32f4-91b2-82fb2f0e1d10"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ESA</div></figure><p>The role of coordinating these segments to focus on a single spot in a distant galaxy falls to the mirrors’ actuator assembly. Seven small motors sit on the backside of each mirror segment (one at each corner and a seventh in the middle), enabling precise control of their orientation and curvature. &quot;Aligning the primary mirror segments as though they are a single large mirror means each mirror is aligned to 1/10,000th the thickness of a human hair,” <a href="https://webb.nasa.gov/content/observatory/ote/mirrors/index.html">said</a> Webb Optical Telescope Element Manager, Lee Feinberg.</p><p>After 20-plus years of development and delays, costing $10 billion and involving the efforts of more than 10,000 people, the Webb Telescope is finally ready for launch — and hopefully this time it’ll actually take. The program has seen delay, after delay, after delay to its launch schedule. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/coronavirus-delays-launch-nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-161528305.html">NASA abandoned the initial date</a> of March 2021 in the wake of the initial COVID-19 outbreak and its associated lockdowns — though, to be fair, the GAO in January 2020 had <a href="https://www.space.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-grim-gao-report.html">only given the JWST a 12 percent chance</a> of getting off the ground by the end of this year — and set a vague “sometime in 2021” timetable for its launch.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/34b0d2c0-5f62-11ec-befd-5fab303b5e8d" alt="The Webb all folded up" data-uuid="fb704177-9389-36c4-8925-b328e642ac78"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure><p>NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-october-2021-120509662.html">later revised that estimate</a> to a firm “sometime in October 2021,” eventually settling on a Halloween launch window, only to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-181128125.html">delay it again</a> to late November/early December. Of course, early December quickly became late December, specifically <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-webb-space-telescope-launch-delay-215323872.html">the 22nd</a>, which was then nudged back once again to its current date of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-telescope-launch-delayed-again-december-24th-111052456.html">December 24th</a>. Actually, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-delays-james-webb-telescope-launch-poor-weather-132056161.html">make that the 25th</a>.</p><p>These delays have been caused by the myriad factors that go into getting an instrument of this size and sensitivity ready for launch. After completing its construction, the JWST had to undergo an exhaustive battery of tests, then be gently loaded into a shipping container and transported to its launch site in Kourou, French Guiana. Once there, the actual task of <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2021/12/10/webb-telescope-fueled-for-flight-ready-for-lifting-atop-launcher/">prepping, fueling, and loading the JWST onto an Ariane 5 rocket</a> took another 55 days.</p><div id="f4c7ffaa8ad843beaa103e43564a639e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7bz03OnyD2A?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>That timeline was further extended due to an “incident” on November 9th wherein, “a sudden, unplanned release of a clamp band — which secures Webb to the launch vehicle adapter — caused a vibration throughout the observatory,” per NASA. The <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/webb/2021/11/22/nasa-provides-update-on-webb-telescope-launch/">Webb’s anomaly review board initiated an additional round of testing</a> to ensure that those vibrations didn’t damage other components or knock anything important out of alignment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/609676b0-5f62-11ec-97ef-4785d602ba0f" alt="JWST deployment schedule" data-uuid="1980b4f9-3f24-3d86-b121-359581b2f435"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure><p>Now that the telescope <a href="https://spacenews.com/jwst-undamaged-from-payload-processing-incident/">has been deemed A-OK</a>, final preparations are underway.

That&#39;s the basic premise of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dont-look-up-trailer-netflix-213006741.html"><em>Don&#39;t Look Up</em></a><em>, </em>the latest film from Adam McKay which premieres on Netflix today. It balances the blunt social commentary from his most recent Oscar nominated films (<em>The Big Short</em> and <em>Vice</em>), with the comic absurdity from his early hits, like <em>Anchorman</em> and <em>Talladega Nights</em>. The result is somewhat uneven and a bit too long, but it&#39;s also a battlecry against the anti-science, fact-phobic reality we&#39;re living through today.</p><p>The comet is an obvious metaphor for climate change, an apocalyptic scenario we&#39;re hurtling towards while governments drag their heels, the fossil fuel industry feigns ignorance and most people go about their lives oblivious about what&#39;s to come. But <em>Don&#39;t Look Up </em>also describes humanity&#39;s bumbling response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a global disaster that&#39;s led to more than five million deaths.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The film&#39;s title is a mantra used by a conservative president (Meryl Streep) to make her red-capped supporters look down at the ground, and not at the glowing comet in the sky they can easily see in the sky. It&#39;s hard not to be reminded of the politicization of COVID-19, which has led to people denying its existence and demonizing vaccines, all because of something they heard on Fox News or their family&#39;s Facebook group.</p><div id="a155c2abd76048b5a4f0ce39b8f4ce19"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RbIxYm3mKzI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>After two astronomers (played by a surprisingly nebbish Leonardo DiCaprio and a spunky Jennifer Lawrence) rush to the White House with news about Earth&#39;s impending destruction in six months, they&#39;re forced to wait. Streep&#39;s President Orlean is dealing with a potential scandal around a Supreme Court nominee, obviously that&#39;s more important. By the time they lay out Earth&#39;s impending doom, Orlean would rather wait and do nothing. &quot;What&#39;s this going to cost me? What&#39;s the ask in place?&quot; she says.</p><p>As the two scientists try to spread the word, first by leaking the doomsday scenario to the media, and then by becoming media personalities of their own, the film takes a scattershot aim at critiquing our modern society. The great Mark Rylance plays a Jobs-meets-Zuckerberg tech executive, the sort of mogul whose idea of innovation is a phone that&#39;ll constantly monitor you to fix negative emotions. (Feeling down? Bash Life will automatically book a nearby therapy session for you.) Cate Blanchett and Tyler Perry pop up as cable news hosts who can only speak to their audience with faux, upbeat banter—yes, even if that news is about humanity&#39;s imminent destruction.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/534ec231-64c8-11ec-aff7-0d5d6675e034" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Leonardo Dicaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Cate Blanchett and Tyler Perry in Don&#39;t Look Up" data-uuid="4e7b3bce-a43d-3f2d-affc-4b8b5b6485f8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Netflix</div></figure><p><em>Don&#39;t Look Up</em> sometimes feels like it&#39;s punching down, especially when it&#39;s focusing on the sheer stupidity of President Orlean&#39;s conservative followers. But the film isn&#39;t afraid to criticize everyone, even its scientist leads. Both characters have trouble properly conveying the significance of their discovery. And when DiCaprio&#39;s astronomer finds his media legs, he&#39;s fully a part of the government propaganda machine.</p><p>By the time the American government finally decides to do something about the comet — only because it benefits the President, of course — it&#39;s dressed up in patriotic showmanship, as if Michael Bay were directing George W. Bush&#39;s tone deaf 2003 Mission Accomplished speech. I won&#39;t spoil where the movie goes from there, but it&#39;s clearly spoofing Bay&#39;s <em>Armageddon</em>.

What do we owe each other, as a civilization? And what will it take to protect this planet in the face of profit-seeking vampires, who would gladly risk humanity for a few more resources? Adam McKay doesn&#39;t have any answers.

The 15-inch <a href="https://amzn.to/3GY5N29">Echo Show 15</a>, available now, is by far the largest size Amazon has attempted, and it’s also notably the first Echo Show you can mount on your wall. Because of that, the company is betting some people will use it not just as a digital photo frame, but also as a family bulletin board. If that’s specifically what you want out of a smart display, the Echo Show 15 could be a niche but very fitting match. Somehow, though, we suspect that’s not most people.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="c25e397a-04b4-4ab5-9b7a-c1705c0c779f"/><h2>Framed like a painting</h2><h2></h2><p>The Echo Show 15 looks like it belongs in a gallery. Its 15.6-inch screen is surrounded by a 0.7-inch white bezel (similar to the matting around a painting), which itself is housed in an elegant black metal enclosure. It’s also quite slim at only 1.4 inches thick. If you told me this was a picture frame, from far away I would probably believe you. The one telltale clue is the camera on the top left corner. You can hide it with a physical shutter using a toggle at the top edge of the frame, where you’ll also find volume controls and a microphone mute button.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since the Show 15 was designed to be hung on a wall, it comes with a mounting bracket along with the necessary hardware. (You’ll have to supply your own electric drill of course.) Amazon only supplies a five-foot electrical cord, though, so you’ll want to mount the device reasonably close to an outlet. Alternatively, you can also route the wire through the wall like you might with a TV, but that’s a more complicated setup.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/94558b70-6251-11ec-b8dd-406bb4adff83" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="8e15aaa5-acd0-3604-91ed-e137878d6438"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>You can choose to mount the Show 15 horizontally or vertically, but you can’t rotate it while it’s still on the wall. You’ll have to take it off, flip the bracket, then put the display back on. The same goes for a desktop stand; you’ll have to choose your preferred orientation before placing the Show 15 on it.</p><p>I didn’t want to drill into my walls (especially not to accommodate a device I’m merely borrowing for this story), so I opted to use the Sanus Tilt Stand that Amazon sent me for review. It’s fairly hefty and bulky, taking up considerable space on my kitchen counter. As its name suggests, the stand lets you tilt the Show up to 30 degrees for better viewing angles. It’s a decent alternative to wall hanging, but if I’m going to have a desktop Alexa-powered display, I’d probably choose one of the other Echo Shows as they’re smaller.</p><p>Still, the 15.6-inch screen here is the best out of all of the Echo Shows, with a 1,920 x 1,080 resolution. The display is so bright and sharp that I can see it clearly across the room (about nine feet away). When it shows full-screen photos and pictures, the frame really does look like a piece of art. It reminds me of the Lenovo Smart Frame we saw at CES 2020, and even Samsung’s The Frame TV, except they’re both a lot bigger – the Lenovo Smart Frame has a 21.5.-inch display while the Frame TV lineup ranges from 32 to 85 inches. Plus, the Smart Frame only showed photos, while The Frame TV is a television that shows art, both of which lack Amazon’s smart display capabilities.</p><h2>Widgets galore</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/dcba0ea0-6241-11ec-9eb7-c1bedaa00752" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="0615c556-9386-3f75-b14f-48a5f51ff000"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Speaking of the sort, one of the key benefits of the large screen is Amazon’s latest Echo Show feature: widgets. Aside from the standard array of rotating home screen content like headlines and weather updates, part of the display can now be customized with tiles. Options include a calendar, a shopping list, sticky notes, to-do lists, the weather forecast, maps and an Amazon package delivery tracker. There’s also a “What to Eat” widget that houses recipe recommendations, restaurant delivery choices and Blue Apron meal kit suggestions.</p><p>This widgets feature will roll out to all Echo Shows eventually, but only the Echo Show 15 will have them persistently on the home screen. You can add as many widgets as you like, though the Echo Show 15 will only display up to six at a time, depending on the tile size. It also pushes the ones you use the most to the front, and you can rearrange them to your preference.</p><p>I found the widgets helpful to see all of my information at a glance. I made heavy use out of the “smart home favorites” widget, which lets me view my security cam feeds and control my smart lights with a single tap. I also liked the picture-in-picture live camera view, which allowed me to see who’s at the front door while watching a video.</p><p>Unfortunately, right now there aren’t many third-party widgets – just 14 at the moment. The company has said it’s built an API for developers to build their own widgets, but it’s unclear if more are coming soon. I would like to see a Spotify widget in addition to the one for Amazon Music, for example. Browser shortcuts for easier access to my favorite websites would also be helpful.</p><h2>Visual ID face recognition</h2><h2></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/20474cf0-6242-11ec-bdef-79ba34e91847" alt="Echo Show 15" data-uuid="8d88d64a-3deb-364d-920b-cf9fcc12597c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Another feature making its debut on the Echo Show 15 is Visual ID, which is similar to Face Match on Google’s Nest Hub Max. It’s a face-recognition feature that shows you information and widgets that are personalized to you, like your day’s appointments or your to-do list. Whenever I came into view, the Echo Show 15 displayed  greetings like “Good morning, Nicole.” It’s smart enough to distinguish me from my husband, who it also recognized well. Visual ID also lets you send messages; when my husband told Alexa to “leave a note for Nicole that says ‘I love you’”, I saw it pop up on the screen later that day.</p><p>This feature won’t be unique to the Echo Show 15 for long; Amazon says the second-gen Echo Show 8 and the third-gen Echo Show 10 will also receive Visual ID through a future update. As for privacy concerns, the company says data for both Visual ID and Voice ID (which is already on all other Echo devices) is stored on the device, with nothing going to the cloud. But if you’re still feeling uneasy, you can simply disable both those features altogether. Additionally, you can view and delete your voice recordings on the Alexa app, if that makes you feel better.</p><h2>Disappointing camera quality</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0a023680-6247-11ec-8abf-e8ebc68cf66d" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="a1492efd-8275-373f-ba40-a490f491440f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Much of the Echo Show 15’s other features are on par with what Amazon offers across the rest of its smart display line, including the ability to set timers, stream music, control Alexa-compatible smart home devices and make video calls. In addition, it has plenty of streaming video options including Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu and even less obvious services like TikTok and Sling TV. That said, YouTube is only accessible via the browser, and the Show 15 doesn’t support Disney+ or HBO Max (which Google’s Nest Hub offers).</p><p>Even though Amazon supports video calls via Skype, the Alexa app or to anyone with an Echo device (Zoom support is coming in 2022), the Echo Show 15 inexplicably uses a subpar camera that’s not as sharp as the 13-megapixel sensors on the Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 10. Plus, the Show 15 doesn’t offer Amazon’s auto-framing feature that keeps you centered in the scene.</p><p>Because the Echo Show 15 is so slim, I’m not surprised the audio quality is as mediocre as it is. It was fine for the occasional chill playlist, but there’s hardly any bass, so I would definitely not use this for entertaining guests.</p><h2>The competition</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/54332200-6247-11ec-bcfd-81382e7dd580" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="c59e073e-346d-3de3-9541-04dda1d0c131"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s really nothing quite like the Echo Show 15 in terms of size. The closest is Facebook’s Portal+, which also measures 15.6 inches. But the Portal+ cannot be mounted on a wall and lacks many of the Echo Show’s apps and features. It also costs $50 more. That said, the Portal+ has a nicer camera with excellent video chat features, so it’s better for calls.</p><p>The Echo Show 15’s closest competitors are its own siblings, the Echo Show 8 and the Show 10. They all have the same features, except, again, the wall mountability. And yes, its larger display is better-suited for widgets on the home screen. That’s about the only real advantage, though, as Visual ID and widgets will be coming to the smaller Echo Shows too. The Show 8 and Show 10 also offer markedly better camera and audio quality. Sure, you’ll have to swipe to see the widgets, but that’s not a big hindrance. The Show 8 is also cheaper at $130 (the Show 10 is closer in price at $250).</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/beb2b440-6249-11ec-afff-710c2bcfc739" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="2b1ae196-e960-3b66-8f74-d97aa2b0a230"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The Echo Show 15’s main advantage is that it can be mounted on a wall, and frankly, that’s the only reason to get it. Yes, the screen is beautiful and makes for a pretty digital photo frame, but the rest of its features aren’t better than the smaller Echo Shows. Plus, its camera is somehow even worse than on smaller Echo Show devices. Unless you’re really committed to the idea of having a smart display on your wall, you’re better off with one of Amazon’s other Echo Shows.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-review-163035555.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">272c4d39-ed0c-454e-8e4e-55b937dac975</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 17:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640338078</ingested><modified>2021-12-24T09:28:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7cab2530-6241-11ec-b5ae-0fe0e3321926" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7cab2530-6241-11ec-b5ae-0fe0e3321926" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 15]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 15]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why the global chip shortage isn't ending anytime soon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>News of the global chip shortage has been so far-reaching this year, it&#39;s become a meme. &quot;I&#39;m sorry I forgot to do the dishes, there&#39;s a global chip shortage.&quot; But as with many online jokes, there&#39;s a kernel of truth to it. The semiconductor chip crisis is real, and it&#39;s had a serious impact on our lives. Cars are more expensive and harder to build. Computer makers are rushing to keep up with an insatiable consumer demand for remote work and school devices. And <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-delay-2022-150309858.html">countless products </a>have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-delay-december-220026363.html">been delayed</a>, with release dates being pushed like dominoes throughout 2021 and into the coming years.</p><p>While it&#39;s an issue that affects practically everyone, the chip shortage has been particularly painful for gamers. A year after the PlayStation 5&#39;s launch, it&#39;s still practically impossible to order one. (At least, not without paying an exorbitant markup, or following stock bots like a machine.) And PC players itching to upgrade their GPUs, who have already gotten used to dwindling hardware supplies and skyrocketing prices, will have to live with their old video cards a bit longer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As Forrester Analytics&#39; Glenn O&#39;Donnell tells Engadget, the issue is mostly a simple supply and demand problem. You can point to several reasons for that: <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-19/a-year-of-poor-planning-led-to-carmakers-massive-chip-shortage">carmakers lowered their hardware orders</a> at the start of the pandemic, with the assumption that consumers wouldn&#39;t be interested in buying new vehicles. It turns out the opposite was true – the overwhelming demand has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/21/used-car-prices-have-surged-how-to-make-that-work-to-your-advantage.html">pushed used car prices up significantly</a>. Chipmakers were also forced to keep up with a rising demand for PCs, game consoles and a wide assortment of gadgets while also dealing with production slowdowns amid COVID lockdowns and other precautions.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e85f6f80-6407-11ec-baff-991e46471db3" alt="Xbox Series X and PS5" data-uuid="aba9f13d-fbcb-377a-9c6e-2bdfd794089a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Aaron Souppouris/Engadget</div></figure><p>&quot;I&#39;d like to say things have improved, but they actually have gotten a little bit worse, and I&#39;m not surprised,&quot; O&#39;Donnell said in a recent interview with Engadget. In April, he argued that the <a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/the-global-chip-shortage-wont-ease-soon/?utm_source=pr_pitch&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=tech_futurefit">global chip shortage would continue throughout 2022</a> and into 2023. Now, he&#39;s even more convinced that we won&#39;t see any major relief until then. While <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">future chip fabs from Intel</a>, TSMC and Samsung could boost supplies, it will still take at least two years from when those companies break ground to when they&#39;re up and running. Intel <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-breaks-ground-two-new-leading-edge-chip-factories-arizona.html#gs.jh3hli">began construction on its two Arizona chip factories </a>in September, and it doesn&#39;t expect to have them operational until 2024.</p><p>Basically, get used to chip shortage, as we&#39;ll be suffering through it for a while. In an <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Supply-Chain/Intel-CEO-warns-chip-shortage-to-last-until-2023-as-demand-soars">interview with Nikkei last week</a>, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger also confirmed that he expects the situation to last until 2023. &quot;COVID disrupted the supply chains, causing it to go negative,&quot; he said during a press event in Malaysia, where the company is investing $7.1 billion in manufacturing and packaging lines. &quot;Demand exploded to 20 percent year-over-year and disrupted supply chains created a very large gap ... and that exploding demand has persisted.&quot;</p><div id="eba7ae83d8cb40508d29560e347634b1"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PIzitZAah9A?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang echoed that sentiment in <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-ceo-we-dont-have-any-magic-bullets-to-deal-with-chip-shortage-212549454.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucmVkZGl0LmNvbS9yL2hhcmR3YXJlL25ldy8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAO08GkuUA820cGNJzshMZlRikdCke-DZ99QPTTvTP98r_vaqeJthZDqih0NtVZU5M9LMktVzw24d1lyqUTeYidlFS84RxzxbUZaxzh9KotrNIZ8IwXMInla_mOKusZZrdJPx1VCGrmDIVxasczOuTsIdU67AVfVmyHF-FO1nMOz">a recent <em>Yahoo Finance</em> interview</a>, saying he doesn’t think there are any “magic bullets” when it comes to dealing with the supply chain. Huang also noted that NVIDIA’s own group of suppliers is multi-sourced and diverse, so the shortage shouldn’t dramatically affect the development of new products. But NVIDIA has also struggled to keep up with gamer demands even before the pandemic. Scalpers and cryptominers usually bought up all of the available stock, leaving average consumers with a limited amount of inventory from stores and resellers.</p><p>While Huang expects production to ramp back up in 2023, he also believes the pandemic-driven push towards buying more computers and gaming hardware is here to stay. “I think these are permanent conditions, and we’re going to see new computers being built for quite a while,” he told Yahoo. “People are building home offices, and you could see all of the implications.”</p><p>In the US, there’s a glimmer of hope that the Innovation and Competition Act (USICA), which includes $52 billion in funding for the CHIPs for America Act, could spur on more semiconductor production. But after passing the Senate earlier this year, the legislation has stalled in the House of Representatives, where <a href="https://money.yahoo.com/dispute-over-china-tech-measure-235616022.html">Republican members said</a> they would block USICA. The bill also includes $190 billion towards improving American semiconductor R&amp;D, all in the hopes of becoming more competitive with China, which dramatically boosted its chip production over the last decade.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6be558bdc49b4b7ea6c378b497acb86f" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/992d87b0-c350-11eb-befd-e9ed148a7507" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti"></section><p>The manufacturing conflict between the two countries came to a head this year, when the Biden administration reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-white-house-discouraged-intel-chip-factory-161435175.html">discouraged Intel from ramping up its chip production in China</a>. And, of course, it doesn’t help that the US and China have been engaged in a quiet cyberwar for years. That’s despite the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-19-us-china-cyberwarfare-treaty-talks.html">agreement made between President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping</a> in 2015, where both leaders said they wouldn’t support or engage in online intellectual property theft. Most recently, the US, UK and security experts blamed China for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-email-server-exploited-30000-us-organizations-043324374.html">massive Microsoft Exchange hack earlier this year</a>, which infiltrated over 30,000 American companies.</p><p>Given the many obstacles in the way of fixing the chip supply chain, there’s one thing everyone may have to get used to: Just be prepared to live with your gear longer. O&#39;Donnell says he’s noticed corporate suppliers trying to eke out another year or two before they refresh their business machines. For gamers, there’s surely a healthy backlog of titles for your existing consoles, so don’t stress about not being able to grab that PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X so much. And despite the droolworthy benchmarks we’ve seen from NVIDIA’s new RTX 30-series cards, you can still play almost every major game on a 20-series GPU (and even many older ones!).</p><p>The chip shortage could conceivably stretch out this latest console generation, as well. But really, who knows what the gaming world will look like in five to seven years? The PS5 and Xbox Series X are already plenty fast, with support for 4K, 120FPS and a bit of ray tracing. And if we’ve learned anything from the success of the Switch, it’s that you can do <em>a lot</em> with aging hardware.</p><p>By 2026, it may also make more sense to stream games over the cloud, instead of demanding the fastest hardware possible under your TV. But even if the cloud ends up dominating the gaming landscape within the decade, it’ll still rely on servers, displays, accessories and powerful networking hardware to make it all possible. Hopefully by then, suppliers will actually be able to keep up with our insatiable desire for chips.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/global-chip-shortage-gamers-gpu-console-delays-160008383.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cec4bfda-c2f2-4d2f-a57f-6872352f1a79</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 16:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640327879</ingested><modified>2021-12-24T06:38:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/45b48590-6407-11ec-bae3-276f42463d83" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/45b48590-6407-11ec-bae3-276f42463d83" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VCG via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JIASHAN, CHINA - MAY 25: Employees work on the production line of silicon wafer at a factory of GalaxyCore Inc. on May 25, 2021 in Jiashan County, Jiaxing City, Zhejiang Province of China.

And what a year it’s been, with new installments in storied franchises, remakes of forgotten classics and a game where you date your sword. As is tradition, the Engadget team gathered together to ruminate on their favorite titles released this year, extolling their virtues and sometimes drawbacks, but mostly explaining why we like them so much. We’ve also thrown in a few of our older faves that we played in 2021, because hey, a good game is always a good game. (Also, it helps when there are updates.)</p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Age of Empires IV" href="https://amzn.to/3F7RTcU">Age of Empires IV</a></h2><div id="58cec81d041f468fa8f75c6677385e13"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTaCrP_U4ao?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>When people look back at Microsoft’s 2021, they’ll cite <em>Halo: Infinite</em> and the extra year the company gave 343 Industries to work on the game as one of its best recent decisions. But I think the company also deserves praise for taking a chance on Relic and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-21-age-of-empires-4-in-development.html"><em>Age of Empires IV</em></a><em>.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Coming off the dismal <em>Dawn of War III, </em>fans had every right to be skeptical of whether the studio could pull off a sequel to one of the most-loved real-time strategy games in history. Relic had a nearly impossible task before it. And yet it found a way to respect the history and roots of the series while pushing it forward in new and interesting ways. The star of the show here are the eight civilizations. Mechanically, they’re far more unique than the factions you could play as in past games. Each has a handful of twists that make them fun to learn and interesting to play against. The studio also changed how you move between the ages to present the player with interesting choices.</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AoE4" href="https://amzn.to/3F7RTcU"><em>AoE4</em></a> isn’t perfect, but neither was <em>Age of Empires II </em>before its Age of Conquerors expansion. More than anything, I’m excited to see where Relic takes the series should Microsoft give the studio the chance to continue working on the series. — <em>Igor Bonifacic, Contributing Editor</em></p><h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/674930/Boyfriend_Dungeon/">Boyfriend Dungeon</a></h2><div id="621502e024b64a03beab5a79377a6cc8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOhVJuN_3Ao?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Boyfriend Dungeon</em> is a perfect blend of sword-swinging action and insatiable horniness — but not, like, in a gross way. This is the dungeon crawler of your middle-school daydreams, offering eye candy in a variety of forms and art styles, plus a mall packed with monsters to slay. And sales! But mostly monsters.</p><p>Everything about <em>Boyfriend Dungeon</em> is playful, from the cell phone messaging system, to the bright character customization options and the library of &#39;zines that serve as power-ups. The most charming aspect of the game, though, is the arsenal of flirty, dateable weapons. Players, <em>ahem</em>, forge relationships with the personalities behind the blades and then bring them into battle, choosing which combat style (or dating tactic) feels right in the moment. Combat itself is fast-paced yet adorable, with TV sets, flying VHS tapes, bats and phones attacking from every corner of the mall. There are also opportunities for small dates in between the battles, keeping the hormonal vibes alive.</p><p>Not only do you get to date your weapons in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/674930/Boyfriend_Dungeon/"><em>Boyfriend Dungeon</em></a>, but they’re all gorgeous and charming in their own way. Best of all, they’re not limited by the old-school definition of a <em>boy</em>friend. There’s a sword for nearly every play style here. <em>Wink</em>. — <em>Jessica Conditt, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Deathloop" href="https://amzn.to/3IQ6BaT">Deathloop</a></h2><div id="6f697b21fc8c4b0b8f35d52c7d65a9ee"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mc2hz3LJhTY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>To say I love Arkane Studio&#39;s <em>Dishonored</em> series is an understatement. I&#39;ve spent countless hours extolling the virtues of that series&#39; slick stealth gameplay, gorgeous steampunk art design and inventive level design. While the first game was successful enough to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-15-dishonored-2-has-a-good-reason-to-play-its-new-game-plus-mode.html">spawn a sequel</a> and a<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-26-dishonored-death-of-the-outsider.html"> standalone entry</a>, <em>Dishonored </em>never reached the massive mainstream popularity it deserved. (You could <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-15-prey-2017-hands-on-preview.html">say the same for <em>Prey</em></a>, another critical darling that sold poorly.)</p><p>Since we first saw a glimpse of <em>Deathloop</em>, it looked like an intriguing remix of some of <em>Dishonored&#39;s</em> best components. There were magical powers that let you teleport at will. It was a first-person stealth game that leaned heavily on both melee weapons and guns; and it looked absolutely beautiful. Personally, I was hoping that Arkane would be able to recreate the magic of <em>Dishonored</em> to make it more palatable to general players.</p><p>Well, <em>Deathloop</em> isn&#39;t that. Its time loop mechanics are hard to parse at first — in particular, it takes a while to learn what you should actually be doing to make any sort of progress. Even dealing with the game&#39;s menus can be migraine-inducing, especially when you&#39;re learning how to keep weapons between multiple loops.</p><p>But just like my colleague <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html">Jessica Conditt</a>, I loved every minute of it. It’s a blast to play, so long as you’re attuned to its stealth mechanics. I seriously dug the multiplayer mode, which puts you in the shoes of the game’s main antagonist, Julianna, as she hunts down other players. It’s not as fleshed out as the single-player campaign, but it sure felt great ruining someone else’s loop.</p><p>While it&#39;s not quite the <em>Dishonored 3</em> I really want, I can&#39;t help but applaud Arkane for the sheer amount of innovation packed within <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Deathloop" href="https://amzn.to/3IQ6BaT"><em>Deathloop</em></a>. Sure, it&#39;s a time loop game like so many others; the day repeats itself like clockwork, and you&#39;re also pushed back to the beginning if you die. But, crucially, it also builds on that concept. If a similar temporal anomaly were discovered in our world, it likely wouldn&#39;t be too long before a bunch of elite technocrats started using it as a way to achieve something close to immortality. — <em>Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><a href="https://playdeathsdoor.com/">Death’s Door</a></h2><div id="804acbe521dd485797b6e4747d79653e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D_tmwz-AhgQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/deaths-door-playstation-november-23-213345948.html"><em>Death’s Door</em></a> was the best game I played in 2021.

To me, someone who loved <em>Ocarina of Time </em>and <em>Majora’s Mask </em>growing up, its familiar and comforting Zelda-like rhythms were exactly what I needed in a challenging year. Everything about <a href="https://playdeathsdoor.com/"><em>Death’s Door</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is also perfect. From the music to the art style and gameplay, developer Acid Nerve has crafted one of the best adventures in recent memory. — <em>I.B.</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Famicom Detective Club" href="https://amzn.to/3DUBgAe">Famicom Detective Club</a></h2><div id="161c62a485354afcb4e19d899db0281b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhWxF5LLR1U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>I’m a huge fan of visual novels — in my time at Engadget I’ve lauded games like <em>Doki Doki Literature Club</em> and <em>Dream Daddy</em> — so it’s no surprise that I enjoyed <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Famicom Detective Club" href="https://amzn.to/3DUBgAe">Famicom Detective Club</a> when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/famicom-detective-club-preview-nintendo-switch-130002504.html">I played the pair of re-released games for the Nintendo Switch</a> back in May.&nbsp;</p><p>The stories, particularly <em>The Missing Heir</em>, are compelling while the characters are easy to like. The gameplay is a little simple compared to the complexities of modern titles, but that just made me appreciate the genre more. I preferred the first game to the second, <em>The Girl Who Stands Behind</em>, but who am I kidding, you can’t play just one; they’re that fun. I hear that developer MAGES is willing to do a third installment, and I’d like to see where the series goes with a more modern spin. — <em>Kris Naudus, Buyer&#39;s Guide Editor</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Forza Horizon 5" href="https://amzn.to/3EQzxx7">Forza Horizon 5</a></h2><div id="f9a5576f1e064a8f93555de932948387"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYH9n37B7Yw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>I’ve never been a huge fan of realistic racing games, mostly because of that one word: <em>realistic</em>. I don’t have the patience to tweak my car and master all the skills necessary to make the most out of those games. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-preview-xbox-series-s-bronco-130028198.html"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>pulls off a great trick by making its racing <em>just</em> realistic enough while still being extremely approachable. The library of classic and modern vehicles means you can easily find your dream car(s), and the game makes it easy to auto-tune your collection for peak performance if you don&#39;t want to spend time picking out suspension systems, tires and so forth.</p><p>There’s also the brilliant “rewind” button: Taking tight corners at speed without wiping out (or going so slow around them that the entire field blows past you) is not easy, but rewinding means you can easily erase any big mistakes you make and take the corner all over again. It helped me learn faster than I would have if I ended up in last place every time I took a turn.</p><p>Beyond that, the world of <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> simply looks amazing — the beautifully-rendered jungles, mountains and open roads of this fictionalized corner of Mexico make for a perfect driving backdrop. It’s beautiful to look at, and the variety of terrain means you’ll get a huge variety of terrain in the different races to try.</p><p>In a year when I’ve shied away from the narrative-heavy, single-player games that I typically prefer, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Forza Horizon 5" href="https://amzn.to/3EQzxx7"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a> has been a perfect escape over the last few months. It’s the kind of game you can sink hours into at a time, or just pick up and play for a few races. And between the variety of race types, different weather conditions, weekly challenges and much more, it’s a game I think I’ll be coming back to for a long time. — <em>Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Halo Infinite" href="https://amzn.to/3GKmqOE">Halo Infinite</a></h2><div id="325a95c7a87247578b7ad166c3cf939c"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PyMlV5_HRWk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-review-campaign-xbox-microsoft-080158610.html">In my review of the <em>Halo Infinite</em> campaign</a>, I criticized the game for relying on tired narrative threads and repetitive mechanics. I found myself wanting more innovation out of a modern, open-world Halo, rather than a cramped map of overly familiar landscapes and a lineup of the best tricks taken from other successful franchises.</p><p>All of that remains true, but hey — it’s still Halo.</p><p>When it comes to gameplay, <em>Infinite </em>is the best Halo’s been. It doesn’t thrust the series forward in any significant way, but it spit-shines the best features and presents everything in a polished environment that’s perfectly suited for floaty, fast-paced gun battles. The campaign evokes your warm-fuzzy nostalgic feelings and, even though it may not feel like a massive open world, offers a larger area to explore than ever before.</p><p><em>Infinite</em>’s multiplayer matches benefit from the franchise improvements as well. There are tight and large-scale maps, a handful of new weapons with plenty of kick, and fan-favorite guns on offer like the Needler and Battle Rifle. This is the refreshing Halo experience we’ve been waiting (and <em>waiting</em>) for, driven by new tools like the Grappleshot, a hook that allows players to fly around the map like a short-range, hard sci-fi Spider-Man.</p><p>In comparison to other open-world action-adventure games and rapid-fire FPS titles, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Halo Infinite" href="https://amzn.to/3GKmqOE"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>doesn’t deliver anything particularly innovative, but it also doesn’t have any catastrophic failures. For a franchise in its 20th year, that’s a successful outcome. Especially in comparison to other Halo games, <em>Infinite</em> is an achievement that any fan should be happy to play. — <em>J.C.</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Marvel&#x002019;s Guardians of the Galaxy" href="https://amzn.to/3secBUS">Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</a></h2><div id="b6ea01f983b04fdc85ac6e2e2b441682"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oki56MQfiHI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>After the disappointment of last year&#39;s <em>Avengers</em>, I went into <em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em> with low expectations. I&#39;ve rarely been so happy about being proved wrong.</p><p><em>Guardians </em>is a blast. The story zips along, taking the crew from one gorgeous, colorful alien environment to the next as they try to save their skins and, inevitably, the galaxy.</p><p>You can only play as Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord), though you&#39;re rarely without at least one of your companions. The crew retains the quippy, rapid-fire dialogue from James Gunn&#39;s films and the characters talk almost constantly. Thankfully, the writing&#39;s the strongest part of the game, with a solid slate of jokes and story-centric lines. There are also dialogue choices (much like in a Telltale game) that can affect how a level plays out.</p><p>Eidos-Montréal had the chance to create a Guardians story that’s distinct from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The characters look, sound and act different from the MCU crew. It was initially a little jarring given how much I enjoy James Gunn’s movies, but I quickly grew to love them.</p><p>Unfortunately, the combat isn&#39;t great. Quill&#39;s guns are woefully underpowered at first, so fights are more about managing the rest of the team&#39;s more impactful abilities. A power-up mechanic that brings the team together in a seemingly inspiring huddle is annoying, while some of the enemy encounters feel extraneous. Still, the rest of the experience was so enjoyable that the mediocre combat wasn’t too bothersome.</p><p>In a landscape dominated by massive, never-ending games, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Guardians of the Galaxy" href="https://amzn.to/3secBUS"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a refreshing throwback. It&#39;s a single-player adventure that tells a streamlined story with great attention to detail. Best of all, in certain areas where Quill can&#39;t fire his pistols, he&#39;ll point finger guns and make &quot;pew-pew&quot; noises. I never get tired of that. — <em>Kris Holt, Contributing Editor</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Metroid Dread" href="https://amzn.to/3dQjxPJ">Metroid Dread</a></h2><div id="0c3a5d7387c1485b82afa24d781efc47"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOvefm5U250?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>As the first all-new, side-scrolling Metroid adventure since 2002, <em>Metroid Dread </em>had a lot to live up to. Nintendo has experimented both successfully (Metroid Prime Trilogy) and unsuccessfully (<em>Metroid: Other M</em>) with the basic formula, but <em>Dread </em>returns the series to its roots while adding enough new gameplay elements to keep things fresh.</p><p>However, with a series that had been dormant this long, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-is-a-nintendo-essential-151014629.html">new things weren’t what drew me to the game</a>. I had never played a side-scrolling Metroid game all the way through, and this installment is a near-perfect modern interpretation of the “Metroidvania” genre the series helped invent. There’s lots of exploration, back-tracking, and new areas opening up when you get power-ups. It’s a simple formula executed with precision by developer MercurySteam.</p><p>The stealth elements, where Samus has to avoid detection from the powerful E.M.M.I. robots, are new to the series. Fortunately, they aren’t so frequent that they overpower the standard segments. And while they can be difficult, they’re not so tough that I ever got terribly frustrated – they’re <em>just</em> hard enough that finally getting the power you need to take down an E.M.M.I. is extremely satisfying.</p><p>The rest of the game is pretty classic Metroid, but the journey to regain all your lost powers, explore the varied worlds of <em>Dread</em> and take out truly epic boss monsters doesn’t feel like a retread at all. Instead, it reminded me of why Metroid is one of Nintendo’s most classic franchises. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Metroid Dread" href="https://amzn.to/3dQjxPJ"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>showed Nintendo at its best of breathing new life into a series while still keeping it comfortingly familiar. — <em>N.I.</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:New Pok&#xe9;mon Snap" href="https://amzn.to/3se0HKG">New Pokémon Snap</a></h2><div id="4c3c46d709cd4e14b6b62615e43b1d0e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2f-ivvGw0U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Gamers have their holy grails, the titles they’ve love to see that may never get made, like <em>Half-Life 3</em> and an official English translation of <em>Mother 3</em>. For years, the Nintendo 64&#39;s <em>Pokémon Snap</em> was one of those games on that list; I certainly remember people begging for a Wii or DS version back when I worked at The Pokémon Company over a decade ago. (The original got released on Wii Shop, but that’s about it.) So the announcement of <em>New Pokémon Snap</em> was a welcome surprise from last year, and the finished game certainly delivered.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-release-date-april-30-140842000.html">classic rail-shooter gameplay is back</a>, but now with improved graphics. The Pokémon look amazing, and the ability to use motion controls really adds to the immersion. (Though I admittedly did get a bit motion sick.) I’m a fan of birdwatching, but not the best at bird photography. So <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:New Pok&#xe9;mon Snap" href="https://amzn.to/3se0HKG"><em>New Pokémon Snap</em></a> really scratched that itch, with all the fun of logging and collecting them.

On the way there, Alex survives an attack on her caravan, but she&#39;s stranded 500 miles from home and has to make her way back. What&#39;s more, Alex has been blind since birth.</p><p><em>The Vale </em>attempts to replicate how Alex experiences the world in being almost entirely audio-based. Even though it&#39;s a first-person game, the only visuals to speak of, other than menus, are floating particles that offer the player some sense of the 3D environments and provide some contextual details like time of day.</p><p>Unlike many other RPGs, which usually offer a map that&#39;s spilling over with places to go and things to do, everything the player does is based on what they hear. <em>The Vale</em> uses spatial audio (headphones are essential for this one) to help players navigate the space, find other characters to interact with and receive guidance from Alex&#39;s companion. The sound design and voice acting are terrific. I rarely felt unsure about where I was or what was happening, unless that’s intended by the developer.

The company introduced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-clock-2-hands-on-price-specs-availability-040032727.html">modestly updated</a> Smart Clock 2 this year, and we first saw this deal in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-lenovo-smart-clock-2-bundled-with-a-smart-light-is-on-sale-for-25-right-now-135610566.html">early December</a> before it returned today.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=retailevent2021&amp;subId3=CW-LSClock2bundle&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F507060083%3F" id="654a7f06bf2a425d98faabd731e33875" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Lenovo Smart Clock 2 bundle at Walmart - $25</a><p>The design of the Smart Clock 2 is a bit different from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-lenovo-smart-clock-review.html">original</a> in that it has a wider base, but the four-inch screen size remains the same. Lenovo also moved the speakers to the front of the device, resulting in a larger chin underneath the display. It doesn&#39;t hinder the minimalist look of the smart clock, and since it also means the speakers now fire outwards, it should actually help the blaring noise of your alarm reach your ears regardless of the position of the clock in relation to your bed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The biggest new feature on the Smart Clock 2 is that the screen can now double as a night light and you can swipe down on the display to enable it. You can still ask the Google Assistant to activate the night light, but the extra gesture makes it so you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to speak to get some extra light in the middle of the night. Otherwise, the Smart Clock 2 can do everything the original device can, including show weather forecasts, enable alarms, play music and control smart home devices. Lenovo also kept a camera out of the equation yet again, which will make the Smart Clock 2 a more appealing option for those who have no desire to video chat using the alarm on their bedside table.</p><p>We can&#39;t speak for the quality of the Lenovo smart light bulb that&#39;s included in the bundle, but we can say that it supports white and color options with adjustable temperature and brightness. In addition to the companion mobile app, you can control the bulb using the Google Assistant or Alexa — and we expect you may do so using the former quite a bit if you pick up this bundle. If you have a small room in your home that you want to make a bit smarter, this Lenovo bundle is a solid, inexpensive way to do that.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-clock-2-smart-bulb-bundle-walmart-145507550.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">abfb54d9-4ca7-4747-91bc-a80d989ba569</guid><dc:creator>Engadget</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 14:55:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640358191</ingested><modified>2021-12-24T15:03:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Engadget]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f32b1cf0-d5e8-11eb-bdff-625b9715e053" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f32b1cf0-d5e8-11eb-bdff-625b9715e053" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A gray Lenovo Smart Clock 2 on a wireless charging dock with its screen facing the camera.

They have to respect US sanctions (as Intel will continue to do here) and frequently want to be seen embracing American notions of civil and human rights, but they also risk losing a major source of revenue if they antagonize a Chinese government eager to silence criticism. Companies have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/applenot-release-private-relay-china-090524919.html">removed features</a>, transferred data storage and otherwise made exceptions to preserve their business in China.

Amazon has agreed to remind current and former workers across the US about their labor rights on notices posted in workplaces, and on the mobile app and website for workers. Amazon will also send a copy of the notice to email addresses it has on file for any employee who worked at its facilities between March 22nd and December 22nd.</p><p>The notice informs workers that they have the legal right to join, form or assist with a union. They can select a representative to bargain with Amazon on their behalf and &quot;act together with other employees for your benefit and protection.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, workers have more leeway to organize in company facilities. In the notice, Amazon states it will not tell them to leave a property or threaten disciplinary action &quot;when you are exercising your right to engage in union or protected concerted activities by talking to your co-workers in exterior non-work areas during non-work time.&quot; Nor will it ask workers about union activity, or why they&#39;re speaking to co-workers, according to the notice.</p><p>It&#39;ll be easier for the NLRB to sue Amazon if the agency believes it violated the agreement. In such cases, the company agreed to let the NLRB forego an administrative hearing process, which can take a long time to complete.</p><p>“This settlement agreement provides a crucial commitment from Amazon to millions of its workers across the United States that it will not interfere with their right to act collectively to improve their workplace by forming a union or taking other collective action,” NLRB general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/business/amazon-labor-deal.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Engadget has contacted Amazon for comment.</p><p>The agreement is related to six cases brought forward by workers who complained Amazon was impeding their efforts to organize. The company previously settled NLRB cases on an individual basis, but this a broader agreement. The agreement includes references to employees, but not contractors, who make up the bulk of Amazon&#39;s delivery workforce. It&#39;s unclear whether they will be afforded the same rights and protections under the deal.</p><p>The NLRB and Amazon have been at odds in recent times. In November, the labor board ordered Amazon to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-election-rerun-073943796.html">rerun a union election</a> at an Alabama warehouse. It said Amazon interfered with the process. Workers at other facilities have attempted to organize — those at a fulfillment center in New York are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-workers-new-york-forming-a-union-123540725.html">trying once again to unionize</a> after failing to obtain enough signatures <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-staten-island-warehouse-unionization-drive-193814629.html">last time</a>.</p><p>Amazon has long been criticized over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-tornado-edwardsville-illinois-deaths-climate-220437155.html">working conditions</a>. Lawmakers this week <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-warehouse-tornado-democrats-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-153129082.html">sought answers</a> from the company over whether its policies contributed to the deaths of six people after a tornado struck a warehouse in Illinois. Amazon recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-suicide-peak-workplace-violence-leaked-email-165031915.html">warned its workers</a> that an even more demanding workload than usual during the holiday period could have a significant impact on their mental health.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-nlrb-deal-labor-rights-organizing-union-183602018.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dae93414-fd61-4ab3-811e-f387f0c62517</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:36:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640284568</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T18:36:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Unions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/91913530-641b-11ec-ab37-4a931ca531c1" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/91913530-641b-11ec-ab37-4a931ca531c1" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ahmed Gaber / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Staten Island Amazon workers protest in Times Square as they demand union rights, in New York City, U.S., December 22, 2021.

Probably not, but one scientist is pressing forward anyway. <a href="https://ascii.jp/elem/000/004/078/4078646/"><em>ASCII</em></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/lick-it-up-japan-professor-creates-tele-taste-tv-screen-2021-12-23/"><em>Reuters</em></a> report Meiji University professor Homei Miyashita has presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5Gu1WgqTTw">Taste the TV</a>, a set you can lick to get the flavor of whatever&#39;s on-screen. The prototype sends electrical signals to 10 flavor canisters to create unique sprays that cover a (thankfully hygenic) film overlay.</p><p>The device has been long in development. Miyashita <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HIm4LoAZxU">discussed</a> the basic concept of a &quot;taste synthesizer&quot; in spring 2020, and offered an early look at the TV in October this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It sounds disgusting, and people would no doubt give you strange looks if you French-kissed your TV in the middle of a show. However, Miyashita doesn&#39;t necessarily see this as gimmick to add to everyday consumer screens, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-28-sky-3d-channel-closing.html">like 3D TV</a>. He instead imagined lickable screens as tools for cooks and sommeliers, and even hoped to build a platform where you could download tastes like you might songs or videos. This could help you taste recipes from around the world while staying at home.</p><p>The technology might be more practical than you think, too. The professor took about a year to build the prototype himself, and he estimated a shipping version would cost the equivalent of $875 to make. Although you probably wouldn&#39;t make one the centerpiece of your living room, it might be affordable enough for the culinary industry and dedicated gourmands.</p><div id="4c8caf76bd824008a5117a99b7bba672"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5Gu1WgqTTw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/taste-the-tv-lickable-screen-173805499.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2265169e-8204-4f40-b1b8-04428d9e66e4</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 17:38:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640281101</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T17:45:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/945a03e0-63f4-11ec-afeb-c4b0c40c6fdf" width="5406" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/945a03e0-63f4-11ec-afeb-c4b0c40c6fdf" width="5406" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kim Kyung Hoon / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Student of Meiji University Yuki Hou licks a screen of Taste the TV (TTTV), a prototype lickable TV screen that can imitate the flavours of various foods, during its demonstration at the university in Tokyo, Japan, December 22, 2021.
