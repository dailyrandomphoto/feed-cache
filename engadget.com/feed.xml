The Consumer Technology Association (CTA) said CES 2022 will now run January 5th-7th &quot;as an additional safety measure to the current health protocols that have been put in place.&quot; January 3rd and 4th are media-only days when press conferences and keynotes take place.&nbsp;</p><p>Protocols include masks and proof of vaccination to attend in-person events. The CTA also recently announced that it would provide Abbott BinaxNOW COVID-19 tests at badge pickup. The association has asked attendees to complete a rapid test 24 hours before entering a CES venue. If someone experiences symptoms while in a CES venue, the CTA has advised them to report to a first aid station for testing. The organization says it will also provide PCR tests for any attendees who are required to have one by their destination prior to departure from Las Vegas.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the last week, high-profile exhibitors like Amazon, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta and more have cancelled in-person plans for CES 2022. As part of today&#39;s announcement, the CTA explained that over 2,200 companies will still show off their goods on the ground in Vegas, noting that it has added 143 more in the last two weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>CTA CEO Gary Shapiro <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/commentary-ces-will-and-must-go-on-in-las-vegas-2502202/">has defended the decision</a> to keep the show an in-person event as the omicron variant causes COVID-19 case numbers to surge in several parts of the world. “As the world’s most influential technology event, CES is steadfast in its pledge to be the gathering place to showcase products and discuss ideas that will ultimately make our lives better,” said Shapiro. “We are shortening the show to three days and have put in place comprehensive health measures for the safety of all attendees and participants.” Shapiro has pointed to the smaller companies that rely on the event as a potential springboard for products as a key reason for not cancelling the event.

To help soothe their weary mitts, Japanese company <a href="https://japanese.engadget.com/jp-2018-11-04-5mm.html">Bauhutte</a> has created a hand massager for gamers.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.bauhutte.jp/product/msg01h/">MSG-01H-BK hand massager</a>, which works on either hand, has a 15-layer airbag for each finger and a shiatsu plate for the palm.

You&#39;ll need to slide in your hand sideways to massage your thumb. The hand massager automatically shuts off after 10 minutes. Bauhutte suggests using the device before gaming sessions to warm up your hands, when taking breaks and afterward to cool down.</p><p>While some might scoff at a hand massager for gamers, it&#39;s not too ridiculous of an idea. Many esports competitors <a href="https://www.redbull.com/za-en/What%20is%20the%20big%20idea%20eSports%20players%20using%20hand%20warmers">use hand warmers</a> between rounds to absorb moisture, keep their fingers toasty and improve circulation.

It caught attention last year for its <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/japanese-gaming-bed/">gaming bed</a>, and the company sells a wide range of furniture and accessories with gamers in mind, such as a <a href="https://www.bauhutte.jp/product/msg02f/">portable foot massager</a>.</p><p>Bauhutte&#39;s hand massager is only available in Japan for now and it costs around $150. As <a href="https://kotaku.com/behold-a-japanese-hand-massaging-device-for-gamers-1848285815"><em>Kotaku</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes, the company has an English-language site, so it might offer the device elsewhere too.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bauhutte-hand-massager-gamers-160006506.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bad894e9-3e99-4b61-9198-2f22c7fbefeb</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 17:30:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640966053</ingested><modified>2021-12-31T15:54:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0f704f00-6a4c-11ec-aeab-741e4387732b" width="800" height="584" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0f704f00-6a4c-11ec-aeab-741e4387732b" width="800" height="584" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bauhutte]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bauhutte Hand Massager]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bauhutte Hand Massager]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[And the biggest losers in tech in 2021 are...]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It feels like forever since we all were able to look back on the last 12 months and <em>not</em> say “good riddance, you garbage fire hellscape of a year.” 2021 kicked off with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-capitol-riots-cybersecurity-threats-144553438.html">riots at the Capitol</a> and though things seemed to quiet down a little after, all was not well in tech.</p><p>There are companies that are obvious additions to this list, like Meta (formerly Facebook) with its repeated transgressions this year.

The company failed to recognize <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-stop-the-steal-policies-report-205339822.html">the danger</a> posed by the “Stop the Steal” movement until after a violent mob stormed the Capitol. Then COO Sheryl Sandberg <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/sandberg-says-us-capitol-riot-was-not-organized-on-facebook.html">downplayed</a> the role Facebook had played in the insurrection, only to be promptly <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/13/facebook-role-in-capitol-protest/">proven wrong</a>. In the end, the events of January 6th ultimately forced the platform to do something it had studiously avoided for most of the Trump presidency: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-twitter-trump-suspensions-173002449.html">Enforce</a> its rules for his account. (Sort of. Trump’s Facebook ban <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-could-be-back-on-facebook-in-time-for-primaries-164200140.html">isn’t permanent</a>.)</p><p>Elsewhere, the arrival of coronavirus vaccines only highlighted Facebook’s poor track record at combating <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vaccine-misinformation-policies-170012241.html">vaccine misinformation</a>, which surged throughout the pandemic. After years of dragging its feet, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-vaccine-misinformation-193754704.html">finally banned</a> misleading or inaccurate vaccine content. But enough damage had already been done.

She also revealed internal research about the effect of Instagram on teens, which was immediately seized on by lawmakers in Congress.</p><p>Amid all that, Zuckerberg announced not an overhaul of the company’s policies, nor a review of its internal research, but… a new name: Meta. It’s meant to symbolize the company’s newfound commitment to a metaverse that no one can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">fully explain</a>. Will the company change its content moderation policies when it comes to the metaverse? Will it invest more in safety for non-western countries? How will it address hate speech in the metaverse? Facebook, er Meta, has yet to meaningfully address any of those questions. But if recent history is a guide, we all have a lot to worry about.</p><p>— <em>Karissa Bell</em></p><h2>Truth Social</h2><p>You’d be forgiven if, amidst the news of actual importance in 2021, you forgot about TRUTH Social — the upcoming site built by disgraced former president Donald J. Trump. Trump spent most of his presidency fear-mongering and spouting lies on Twitter and other social platforms, which finally resulted in him being banned from Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and most other services of note. While Trump is <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-10/twitter-tells-judge-trump-has-free-speech-wrong-in-suit-over-ban?sref=10lNAhZ9">wrongfully convinced</a> that this is an unlawful witch hunt, he’s also decided to say “who needs ‘em?” and launch his own.</p><p>TRUTH <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-truth-social-061457538.html">was announced in October</a>, with a limited beta planned for November before a full public launch in 2022. Immediately, dedicated internet pranksters <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-social-network-defaced-124507041.html">found a test version of the site</a> in the open and signed up for a slew of high-profile accounts (including, naturally, donaldjtrump and mikepence). (The donaldjtrump account had a profile picture of a defecating pig, for good measure.)</p><p>The test was quickly shut down, but not before it was revealed to be basically a Twitter clone running on the open-source software Mastodon. But since TRUTH Social didn’t properly cite its usage and didn’t share the source code with users, the site <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-truth-social-software-license-violation-185629984.html">was in violation</a> of Mastadon’s open-source license agreement.</p><p>TRUTH’S terms of service were also revealed, and we learned that it was essentially hoping to be protected by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which currently states that services like Twitter and even TRUTH aren’t responsible for what their users post. This shields companies from liability for the awful things those users might share.</p><p>We blissfully haven’t heard much about TRUTH Social since its disastrous first few days in the public spotlight; the company missed the November beta launch date and there’s no update on when the promised full launch might happen. Based on these early struggles, it’s easy to call TRUTH Social a loser of 2021 – but the citizens of the internet who didn’t have to deal with the ugly reality of a Trump-backed social network are all undoubtedly winners.</p><p>— <em>Nathan Ingraham</em></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b426c930-6271-11ec-bbff-e855f71c3329" alt="A woman looks at a data chip containing encryption codes for mobile and landline phones at the booth of Secusmart during the CeBIT trade fair in Hanover March 8, 2014.

According to the California lawsuit, leaders at the studio cultivated a frat house-style environment where sexual harassment was commonplace and gender discrimination was systemic.

Back in July, CEO Bobby Kotick sent an email to employees dismissing the California lawsuit, but he signed <a href="https://kotaku.com/bobby-kotick-actually-wrote-fran-townsends-deranged-co-1848069983">a female employee’s name to it</a>. The response was roundly and loudly criticized, with employees calling it “insulting” and “abhorrent.” Kotick let Frances Townsend, one of the few women executives at Activision Blizzard, take the heat for that letter for months, losing her spot on the studio’s women’s network in the process. Publicly, Kotick called the email “tone-deaf.”</p><p>Blizzard head J. Allen Brack <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html">lost his job</a> shortly after the lawsuit was filed, and Kotick offered a co-leadership role to Mike Ybarra and Jennifer Oneal, who became the first woman to hold a president title since the studio’s founding in 1979. Oneal left the company shortly after this promotion, reportedly because she was being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-jen-oneal-mike-ybarra-equal-pay-after-resignation">paid less than Ybarra</a>, and she felt “tokenized, marginalized and discriminated against” at the studio.</p><p>Activision Blizzard employees have walked out multiple times this year, calling for a culture shift. Major business partners, including PlayStation and Xbox, have said they’re reevaluating their relationships with the studio. Shareholders and media outlets alike are calling for Kotick to resign.</p><p>At this point, investors, employees, analysts, major gaming companies and multiple government agencies agree that Activision Blizzard is a hotbed of discrimination and sexual harassment, and it’s in urgent need of restructuring. In his 30 years as CEO of Activision Blizzard, this is the closest Kotick has come to actually being ousted from his position of power.</p><p>From that angle, it almost feels like a good year for the company. Almost.</p><p>— <em>Jessica Conditt</em></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/67989750-6272-11ec-baa7-4bb31ffcfc6c" alt="A large red sign saying " data-uuid="430546b9-2a2f-36d1-8b7a-e67e2247c28f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Miquel Benitez via Getty Images</div></figure><h2>5G</h2><p>I’m so disappointed with 5G. If, like me, you’ve watched the networking standard since at least 2014, you’ll likely agree. The promises about downloading feature films in seconds were really mostly advantages of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-23-how-5g-makes-use-of-millimeter-waves.html">mmWave technology,</a> which as of today still hasn’t broadly rolled out. The sub-6 network that’s more widely available today on carriers like T-Mobile and AT&amp;T offer a barely noticeable speed boost, and the reported latency improvements it was supposed to bring haven’t been delivered in the real world.</p><p>Yes, the telecom industry did meet its target launch date of 2020 for an initial rollout of the new standard. But 5G is still too confusing for the average consumer. Any time a company says in a briefing that a new product is 5G-ready, a guaranteed follow-up question is “Does that mean sub-6 or mmWave?” And with the recent addition of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-29-fcc-5g-auction.html">mid-band spectrum</a> to the mix, the layers of compatibility are only going to make things more tedious.</p><p>I’ve been more than forgiving in the last couple of years, but it’s been difficult to ignore the complete mess that is the state of 5G in the US today. Sure, we’ve had more pressing issues to deal with, but if consumers are going to embrace the new standards (and be convinced to spend money for the privilege of 5G on their devices), the industry needs to get its act together and either commit to a more coherent message or more consistent rollout.</p><p>— <em>Cherlynn Low</em></p><h2>Workers and big tech&nbsp;</h2><p>For a long time, working at a tech giant like Google or Apple was an enviable position. But 2021 pulled back the curtain a bit on some of these companies, exposing deep-rooted issues with how employees are treated. While not everyone at these massive organizations may be dealing with sexual harassment or poor working conditions (to name just a few issues), the many employees speaking out across the industry are indicative of an underlying trend that need to be confronted by tech’s most powerful leaders.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ab2c1730-6272-11ec-ae7f-0007a092ae61" alt="Amazon&#39;s warehouse facility DSD8 is shown in Poway, California, U.S., September 28, 2021.

At the same time, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-vote-154741754.html">pushed back hard against unionization efforts in Alabama</a>. While the union drive was defeated in a vote, a regional office of the National Labor Relations Board recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/business/amazon-bessemer-alabama-election.html">ordered a new election</a>, effectively invalidating the results of the earlier one. The union had filed a formal objection right after the election, and while there’s no word on when a new election will take place, it’s clear that Amazon will be under intense scrutiny when it does. The same should hold if New York City Amazon workers hold a union vote; reports have indicated that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-staten-island-warehouse-unionization-drive-193814629.html">could happen soon</a>.</p><p>Apple workers also exposed issues within the company this year. In late August, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-workers-201202748.html">call went out</a> for current and former employees to share stories of discrimination, harassment and retaliation that they had experienced. This <a href="https://www.engadget.com/appletoo-starts-publishing-toxic-workplace-stories-051204973.html">led to the start of the #AppleToo</a> website, where these stories are regularly <a href="https://medium.com/appletoo">published</a>.</p><p>As Jess already explained in detail above, employees at Activision Blizzard spoke up about a misogynistic culture rife with sexual harassment, as well. Reports indicated male executives groped female colleagues while other employees joked about rape or ignored women for promotions. The revelations have been so damning a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html">lawsuit</a> was filed by California’s Department of Fair Employment, though somehow Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick still has his job.</p><p>Google isn’t free from sin, either – employees led a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-google-walkout-demands.html">massive walkout</a> back in 2018 around how it dealt with sexual harassment (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-03-google-walkout-for-real-change.html">among other concerns</a>). It hasn’t dealt with things on the same scale as other companies this year, but Google’s recent decision that it wasn’t raising pay to match inflation has certainly rankled workers. These are just a few high-profile examples, but together they paint a dark picture of the environment at some of tech’s biggest corporations. Perhaps the only upside here is that these hopefully put pressure on those in charge to clean house and improve things as quickly as possible.</p><p>— <em>N.I.</em></p><p><strong>Oculus</strong></p><p>Meta didn&#39;t even give Oculus a proper funeral.

It should have been a surefire win for all three of the industry’s leading companies — SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin — but then one of them managed to repeatedly shoot itself in the proverbial landing strut more than the other two combined.</p><p>Now, that’s not to say Blue Origin didn’t enjoy its share of success this year. CEO Jeff Bezos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html">put his money where his oversized stetson is</a> and made a historic trip out to the Karman line along with both the oldest (at least at that point) and youngest people to ever venture into space.

For example, ahead of Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic making its own historic first successful flight into space this past July, <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1413521631717122059">Blue Origin took to Twitter to talk a little trash</a>. This is a little rich from the company that has reportedly become <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-toxic-workplace-employee-letter-181051514.html">a toxic workplace</a>.</p><p>More embarrassing still was Bezos’ repeated, and ultimately unsuccessful, attempts to secure Blue Origin a lucrative NASA contract.

Blue Origin did not.</p><p>Instead, the space lift company doubled down, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-federal-claims-court-nasa-challenge-163927526.html">suing NASA</a> in open federal court, &quot;in an attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA&#39;s Human Landing System,&quot; per a Blue Origin representative <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-federal-claims-court-nasa-challenge-163927526.html">in August</a>.

We&#39;ve asked for more information. Whatever the explanation, it&#39;s rare to see such potentially important material hiding in files a player could uncover.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-hidden-unfinished-cutscene-211419052.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">507bd15f-6eac-42cd-8ceb-3deab2e12413</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 21:14:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640898863</ingested><modified>2021-12-30T21:14:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ed5d6670-69ae-11ec-b777-94b02b0d4902" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ed5d6670-69ae-11ec-b777-94b02b0d4902" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[343 Industries/Xbox Game Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Master Chief in 'Halo Infinite']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Master Chief in 'Halo Infinite']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro update 'paused' to fix dropped calls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bad news, Pixel fans: <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/143183382/december-2021-update-paused?hl=en">Google has confirmed</a> it&#39;s pausing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</a> December update over reports of call dropping and disconnecting.

When your friends are ready to read what you think about [redacted] showing up, they can tap the spoiler text to read it.</p><p>Also new are iMessage-style reactions. You can double tap any message to send a thumbs-up reaction. Tapping once (or tapping and holding on iOS) will let you select other emoji, such as a grin, fire, a shocked face or a thumbs down. You can change the default double-tap emoji in the Chat Settings on Android, and under the Stickers and Emoji section in iOS settings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In private chats, reactions are always enabled. Channel and group admins can decide whether to switch them on and what reactions the other members can choose from.</p><p>Elsewhere, Telegram now has a useful translation option. Through the Language section in Settings, you can enable translation, which adds a Translate button to the context menu. You can nix languages you&#39;re able to understand and the Translate button won&#39;t be available on messages you receive in those languages. Translation is available on all Android devices, but iPhone and iPad users will need to be running iOS 15 or later. The number of languages Telegram supports depends on your operating system.</p><p>In addition, users can generate QR codes for anyone with a public username, as well as bots, groups and channels. You can tap the QR code icon next to their username and select the colors and pattern before sharing it elsewhere. You can find your own QR code in Settings.</p><p>The Telegram team redesigned the context menus on macOS with new shortcut hints and animated icons. The app will display a full-screen effect in one-on-one chats when you send certain emoji too.</p><p>Earlier this year, Telegram added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telegram-group-video-calling-now-available-182705546.html"><ins>group video calls</ins></a> and other features, including a way to <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/protected-content-delete-by-date-and-more"><ins>block</ins></a> others in group chats from taking screenshots and saving shared media, as well as <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel"><ins>live streams</ins></a> with unlimited viewers.

The misconfigured Amazon Web Services S3 bucket contained sensitive information which allowed researchers to arbitrarily upload files to a huge swath of Sega-owned domains, as well credentials to abuse a 250,000-user email list.</p><p>The domains impacted included the official landing pages for major franchises, including Sonic the Hedgehog, Bayonetta and Total War, as well as the Sega.com site itself.

Yukai Engineering, the maker of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/qoobo/"><ins>Qoobo robotic cat tail pillow</ins></a>, has revealed a soft robot that nibbles on a user’s fingertip. The company hopes the &quot;somewhat pleasing sensation&quot; will brighten up your day.</p><p><a href="https://hamham.ux-xu.com/"><ins>Amagami Ham Ham</ins></a> has an algorithm called a “Hamgorithm” that selects one of two dozen nibbling patterns, so you’ll never be sure exactly what you’ll feel when you shove your digit into the robot’s maw. Yukai designed the patterns — which include Tasting Ham, Massaging Ham and Suction Ham — to replicate the feeling of a baby or pet nibbling on one’s finger.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cdba0260-6981-11ec-9aff-8160bca77886" style="height:281;width:500;" alt="A soft robot called Amagami Ham Ham " data-uuid="aa34e227-1d5b-36f0-8aea-5f2488291e35"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Yukai Corporation</div></figure><p>“Amagami” means “soft biting” and “ham” means “bite” in Japanese. Yukai based the look of the robot on a character from Liv Heart Corporation’s Nemu Nemu stuffed animal series. There’ll be a couple of finger-munching models to choose from: Yuzu (Calico Cat) and Kotaro (Shiba Inu).</p><p>“Most people like the nibbling sensation but know they need to teach their children or pets to stop it, because kids and animals will otherwise bite them with full force eventually,&quot; said Yukai Engineering CMO Tsubasa Tominaga, who invented the robot at a hackathon earlier this year. &quot;Amagami Ham Ham is a robot that frees humankind from the conundrum of whether ‘to pursue or not to pursue’ the forbidden pleasure.”</p><p>Pricing hasn&#39;t been determined, but Yukai and Liv Heart plan to run a crowdfunding campaign in the spring. In the meantime, those braving CES can check out Amagami Ham Ham at the show, and perhaps leave Yukai&#39;s booth with a slightly more tender finger.</p><div id="81a53a0589d9420383acb42177bbb7d6"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GiQswlhps4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Among the other devices Yukai will show off at CES is Bocco Emo. The company has updated the original <a href="https://japanese.engadget.com/jp-2015-05-12-bocco-kickstarter.html">Bocco robot</a> to act as a smart medical device. Yukai says hospitals in Japan are using it to monitor patients&#39; vitals (via connected sensors like pulse oximeters and thermometers) and notify nurses about a patient&#39;s condition.</p><p>During a pilot period, Bocco Emo was used to inform patients&#39; families about how they&#39;re doing.

It’s with plenty of loathing that we admit this: NFTs somehow won this year. They’ve taken over. Reddit’s day traders also deserve recognition for the way they’ve managed to manifest GameStop’s slogan, “Power to the players.”</p><p>Also (and this might be the most painful to acknowledge), the Metaverse (sorta) took off this year. At least in terms of our lexicon, with mentions of the word skyrocketing since Mark Zuckerberg uttered it while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2021-earnings-young-adults-metaverse-220703590.html">announcing plan for a richer VR and AR-focused world</a>. Maybe people were confused between “metaverse” and “multiverse” as in <em>Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em>?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Besides the things we love to hate, there are some products this year we genuinely liked as well. Apple continued to impress with its M1 chips and, more importantly, gave users a way to repair their own devices (kinda). Google’s first-ever mobile chip powered clever experiences on the latest Pixel phones and showcased the company’s AI and software prowess at a competitive price. As we continue to be bombarded by depressing news every day, it’s worth taking the time to reflect on the wins this year, no matter how tiny.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/bc783520-626b-11ec-8efa-762a1008a7f7" alt="NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JUNE 28: Digital artist FEWOCiOUS auctions five new unique NFT works of art, along with five physical paintings and never-before-seen drawings in a collection titled " data-uuid="b0827a8c-add6-3fb2-93e6-c4be1e3f9e8b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Noam Galai via Getty Images</div></figure><h2>NFTs</h2><p>2021 has not been a quiet year, so NFTs deserve something approaching praise for securing a spot in the highlights reel. NFTs, or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">Non-Fungible Tokens</a>, are an attempt to create an immutable digital asset in an environment where such a thing has historically been tricky. For the industry’s proponents, it’s a way of imposing some form of scarcity on digital artifacts that you can’t easily make scarce. Anyone can right-click and save a picture of a monkey wearing sunglasses and a Hawaiian shirt after all. But only the person who paid a lot of money for the NFT can go around calling themselves the “owner” of the same. As Nietzche didn’t say, NFTs are the lie agreed upon, suggesting that people respect the owner of the certificated copy of something over everything else.</p><p>So far, the biggest and most notable moves in the NFT space have happened in the art market, with pieces being bought and sold for eye-watering numbers. On March 11th, digital artist Beeple sold <em>Everydays: The First 5,000 Days</em> at <a href="https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/beeple-first-5000-days/beeple-b-1981-1/112924">Christie’s auction house</a> for $69,346,250. Those hefty sums are, in some people’s minds, justified because they believe that NFTs will become the new crypto, with everyone trying to get aboard the bandwagon before it goes big. After all, there are lots of folks who got rich during the Bitcoin boom that want to further enhance their fortunes, while some who were left behind now hope to get in on the ground floor on the next big thing. Others, meanwhile, think that the big craze in NFTs right now is to help folks move large quantities of <a href="https://rusi.org/explore-our-research/publications/commentary/nfts-new-frontier-money-laundering">money around</a> away from the auspices of, you know, <em>regulators</em>.</p><p>The NFT market is so awash with speculator cash that it’s normal to have... questions. A recent <a href="https://hbr.org/2021/11/how-nfts-create-value"><em>Harvard Business Review</em></a> article talks about how commerce can’t work without “clear property rights,” which NFTs help to impose. There’s also the matter of whether NFTs could better enable more reliable and secure ticketing and permission systems? I’ll be honest, I’m personally unconvinced by the argument that NFTs offer rights of ownership, since they don’t necessarily confer upon the buyer the proper rights of ownership.</p><div id="689eca03462645eb968606cf3f25db75"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrNOYudaMAc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>These issues are, however, going to be worked out over the next few years, and it will only be when the speculation has died down that we’ll see if NFTs have any residual worth. And, hey, not every deeply-technical cryptographic ownership record gets their own SNL sketch shortly after they broke into the mainstream, do they.</p><p>— <em>Daniel Cooper</em></p><h2>The Metaverse</h2><p>Mark Zuckerberg didn&#39;t invent the term, but by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">rebadging Facebook as &quot;Meta,&quot;</a> he helped kick off a wave of interest in the metaverse. While it was originally a dystopian view of cyberspace via Neal Stephenson&#39;s Snow Crash, the metaverse now represents the next big online goldrush. You can think of it as the logical step forward from the mobile internet, a world where our online experiences can easily transition between multiple devices. And eventually, it could be something we interact with via AR and VR glasses.</p><p>To be clear, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">we still don&#39;t have an exact idea</a> of what the metaverse will be. The Meta renaming could easily be seen as a way for Zuckerberg to avoid his responsibilities as the leader of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-in-the-facebook-papers-and-what-it-means-for-the-company-194502237.html">a fundamentally broken social media company</a>. But other companies have been exploring this idea for years: Microsoft&#39;s HoloLens has proven to be surprisingly useful for commercial and front-line workers, and it&#39;s also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-mesh-holograms-hololens-ar-vr-164001796.html">core to Mesh</a>, the company&#39;s ambitious solution for virtual meetings. The Borg-like Google Glass was widely ridiculed, but its failure hasn&#39;t stopped Google from thinking about <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-17/google-ceo-sees-company-s-next-trillion-in-value-from-search-ai">its role in the metaverse</a>, either.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;ll take a killer new device, like<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ar-vr-headset-iphone-requirement-chip-175931492.html"> Apple&#39;s fabled AR glasses</a>, to bring the metaverse into focus. Or maybe it&#39;ll go the way of wearables — a category of devices that&#39;s useful for some people, but not necessarily essential for everyone. Either way, it&#39;s something that will forever be tied to 2021.</p><p>— <em>Devindra Hardawar</em></p><h2>Home fitness tech is here to stay</h2><p>As the pandemic kept many of us indoors and out of gyms, companies like Peloton, Apple, Tonal and even Amazon were able to pull us into new fitness habits and equipment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/227f4f60-4aef-11eb-beb3-07edc2f2bd9f" alt="Apple Fitness Plus" data-uuid="c805e4d7-fd68-3d4a-836f-496ebac6df1b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Meanwhile, major fitness studios and gyms like Equinox, Soulcycle, OrangeTheory and F45 have modulated (while some created from scratch) their online services.

And though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">the iPhone 13 Pro</a> is just catching up to Android phones with its 120Hz screen, it&#39;s an undeniably good device with solid cameras and excellent performance. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a> isn&#39;t much different from its predecessor, barring its larger display, but it&#39;s still the best smartwatch around. Plus, Apple TV+ gained much more credibility in 2021 with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-apple-tv-clean-up-at-the-emmys-with-the-crown-and-ted-lasso-053901458.html">giant pile of awards its original series <em>Ted Lasso</em></a> brought home.</p><p>But the biggest thing that Apple did this year was to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html">start selling DIY iPhone and Mac repair kits</a> to consumers. After it was discovered Face ID on an iPhone 13 would stop working if a third party replaced its screen, the company first issued a software fix for this specific issue and announced the repair kits shortly after. The move was hailed by activists as a victory for the right-to-repair movement, given the company’s history of making it obnoxiously difficult for you to get your Apple products fixed by anyone else.</p><p>Of course, Apple could still do better — activists say the company’s plans could be more comprehensive, for example. But this is a major reversal of policy that shows the company is opening up, ever so slightly. Last year, it allowed users to set third-party browsers and email apps as their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-change-default-apps-email-browser-195555516.html">default on iPhones and iPads</a>. This year, it introduced FaceTime on the web as a means to allow PC and Android users to join calls that they had previously been excluded from. The company may never fully embrace integrating different ecosystems into its walled garden, but it seems they’re at least listening to what people want and taking small steps towards giving users what they deserve.</p><p>— <em>Cherlynn Low</em></p><h2>Gamestop</h2><p>At the start of 2021, Gamestop’s share price was $17.25.

In 2020, its main challenges were around trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-20-gamestop-essential.html">keep its outlets open</a> in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-20-gamestop-closes-california-stores.html">face of stay-home mandates</a> and making sure it had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gamestop-ps5-preorder-restrock-203545363.html">enough consoles to sell</a>.</p><p>This year, in possibly the most 2021 combination of words ever, GameStop announced it’s working on an <a href="https://nft.gamestop.com/">NFT platform</a> based on Ethereum.

It made $1.18 billion in the second quarter compared to $942 million in the same period in 2020. That could partly be due to the fact that Sony and Microsoft launched their consoles after the second quarter in 2020. Basically, 2021 has been a great year for GameStop, and not just for its business.</p><p>Discovery+ is even working on a documentary (narrated by “Wolf of Wall Street” Jordan Belfort) on the entire fiasco titled <em>GameStop:The Wall Street Hijack</em>. Nine other films based on these events are reportedly in the works, according to <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/02/inside-hollywoods-rush-to-make-the-first-gamestop-movie.html"><em>Vulture</em></a>. Gamestop wasn’t the only company that Reddit’s day traders flocked to in their nostalgia-driven frenzy, either. Companies like BlackBerry and AMC also saw their share prices surge, with the latter’s stock <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameStop_short_squeeze#Other_affected_assets">jumping 480 percent</a> at its peak.

I&#39;d bet even Microsoft was surprised it managed to make that happen.</p><p>Windows 11 rose from the ashes of Windows 10X, an OS variant that was originally supposed to focus on dual-screen devices, but was eventually canceled in May. That would explain why Windows 11 feels more like a fresh coat of paint on its predecessor.

Best of all, it does so for hundreds of dollars less than rival flagships.</p><p>— <em>C.L.</em></p><h2>Samsung foldables&nbsp;</h2><p>In an admittedly niche industry, Samsung has pulled far ahead. Sure, it was one of the first to try its hand at foldables, but it&#39;s also arguably the last one standing. The foldable phone race really kicked off when relative unknown Royole showed off the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-11-how-royole-built-the-worlds-first-foldable-phone.html">first working prototype at CES 2019</a>. Soon after, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-25-huawei-mate-x-closer-look-june-launch-cameras-screen-crease-bump.html">Huawei</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-20-samsung-galaxy-fold.html">Samsung</a> announced their own devices. The original Mate X and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-15-samsung-galaxy-fold-hands-on-price-release-date.html">Galaxy Fold</a> made the rounds at various press events after, but only Samsung eventually sold its first-gen foldable to the general public (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-23-huawei-mate-x-china-november-15.html">outside of China</a>, anyway).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7243b550-0754-11ec-9fca-3bf7ca5ab8c0" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 laying open, flat on its back, on a window ledge." data-uuid="e5202088-1b98-3058-86d9-fd11f48eae8b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Motorola <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-motorola-razr-foldable-hands-on-preview-2019.html">jumped on the trend</a>, capitalizing on the sheer nostalgia value of its Razr Flip phone. Alas, all these initial attempts were doomed to fail. Foldables, it turns out, with their soft, vulnerable displays and damage-prone hinges, are hard to nail. Worse, the Razr Flip&#39;s screen just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-motorola-razr-review-2020-foldable-fashion-statement.html">felt weird and flimsy</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-07-motorola-razr-cnet-fold-test.html">its hinge</a> would make a cracking sound when you open or close the phone.</p><p>After a slew of reports of broken review units, Samsung returned with updated iterations of the Fold. It also released the Flip series, a smaller, Razr-like version that received its share of early complaints. Yet, today, Samsung not only continues to produce these foldables, but at cheaper prices, too. The Z series is now in its third generation, and Samsung said it shipped four times more foldables in 2021 than in 2020. While Huawei also unveiled a third version this year, its foldables haven’t been available in most places outside of China. We&#39;ve also yet to see a new version of the Razr this year, although Motorola did roll out a 5G-capable update in 2020 that we never got to test. Companies like Oppo and Xiaomi have also unveiled their own foldables recently, but they’re relatively new to the game.</p><p>By bringing the price of the Z Flip 3 down to a more competitive $999 while continuing to improve the durability and usefulness of its products, Samsung has shown it may be the only company with the resources and expertise to continue to deliver foldable phones, even if they may never gain mainstream popularity.</p><p>— <em>C.L.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-products-and-companies-2021-143005186.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b3840c7-dcc6-4b3d-9e1d-13c056b3e7c3</guid><dc:creator>Engadget</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 14:30:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640878305</ingested><modified>2021-12-30T15:44:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Engadget]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6db401c0-641f-11ec-becf-13c992f13693" width="2024" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6db401c0-641f-11ec-becf-13c992f13693" width="2024" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tech year in review winners]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tech year in review winners]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla recalls nearly half a million cars over camera and trunk defects]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-had-a-phenomenal-2021-150044600.html">recall-filled 2021</a> isn&#39;t over quite yet. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-30/tesla-recalls-over-475-000-u-s-cars-on-camera-trunk-issues?sref=10lNAhZ9">reports</a> Tesla has issued recalls for just over 475,000 vehicles to fix defects in camera systems and trunks.

You&#39;ll have to visit Tesla to get a fix, but the company will compensate anyone who paid for relevant repairs before the recalls took effect.</p><p>None of the defects led to crashes or injuries, Tesla said. However, the recalls cap a series of issues that include an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">NHTSA investigation</a> over Autopilot safety, recalls for components like touchscreens, and complaints about build quality problems like panel gaps.

One of the steps it has taken to comply with Apple&#39;s guidelines is to limit the results for certain tags or search terms that Tumblr says &quot;may fall under the expanded definition of sensitive content.&quot; The website will even completely block some of them — make that more than some, based on this pretty <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YG7E84Dvs2PyoKMgSgZFgEX0Kh0RtJqsazZsyVGY8dk/mobilebasic">lengthy list</a> of banned and limited terms collected by Tumblr users that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> posted.&nbsp;</p><p>While the inclusion of specific words in the list is self explanatory, it also has some curious entries, such as &quot;Eugene Levy&quot; and &quot;Tony the Tiger.&quot; The restriction will also make it harder to search for content related to mental health, such as PTSD, depression and anxiety, as well as issues like racism and transphobia. Those searching for a blocked tag will get a screen that says &quot;This content has been hidden&quot; instead of a page with results. They&#39;ll see the same notification if they try to access a blog that&#39;s been flagged as &quot;explicit&quot; on the app. Users may also see fewer suggestions under the &quot;stuff for you&quot; and &quot;following&quot; sections due to the new restrictions.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tumblr has implemented these changes three years after it started completely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-03-tumblr-blocking-adult-content-december-17th.html">blocking adult content</a> on its platform. If you&#39;ll recall, Tumblr prohibited adult content in 2018 after Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-20-tumblr-pulled-app-store-child-exploitation.html">pulled</a> its app from iTunes in response to finding child exploitation photos on the website. The social network said these changes only apply to its iOS app and that they won&#39;t affect anyone browsing Tumblr on the web or on Android. A spokesperson also told <em>TechCrunch</em> that the company is &quot;working on more thoughtful solutions which will be rolled out in the near future.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-ios-tags-restriction-115024668.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93fa43d5-aa41-4218-9381-480724b1d0dd</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 11:50:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640864868</ingested><modified>2021-12-30T11:47:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2018-12/e560f4a0-f724-11e8-bbfd-8a61f9182b6e" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-12/e560f4a0-f724-11e8-bbfd-8a61f9182b6e" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas White / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Tumblr application is seen on a mobile phone in this illustration photo March 7, 2018.

Even if the buds are tiny, they&#39;re still highly visible due to their color. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-jlab-go-air-review-29-dollar-true-wireless-earbuds.html">JLab</a> is on a quest to remedy this and the audio company teamed up with nail care brand ORLY to develop a solution. With <a href="https://www.jlab.com/TONES">the Go Air Tones</a>, the duo selected a collection of seven Pantone colors that are &quot;flattering for people across a spectrum of skin tones.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>JLab says it worked with ORLY to select the final hues from an original collection of over 60 options. Given the beauty brand&#39;s experience with creating nude nail polishes, the seven colors &quot;encompassed a variety of skin tones with a mix of warm, neutral and cool undertones. While the colors reflect actual skin tones, most users will find the colors &quot;flattering&quot; without an exact match, according to JLab. If you&#39;re having trouble selecting the best option, JLab offers <a href="https://www.jlab.com/pages/fitting-room">an AR fitting room</a> for a virtual try-on that might help you decide.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/599715c0-68f6-11ec-9757-e551f6b92a1c" style="height:1334;width:2000;" alt="JLab Go Air Tones" data-uuid="1b50bcad-bf48-3149-ad0b-c612acf6aba7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">JLab</div></figure><p>The Go Air Tones are the same earbuds as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jlab-go-air-pop-true-wireless-earbuds-20-dollars-130024634.html">the $20 Go Air Pop</a> that JLab debuted back in August.

Oink Games’ is no Jackbox, but it's a worthy party game collection]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every year I try to have a little “holiday gaming café” gathering at my apartment, where I invite friends over to play board and card games. While last year’s party was understandably cancelled, this year I invited a small group over and we indulged in tabletop titles like <em>We’re Doomed</em> and <a href="https://keymastergames.com/products/parks"><em><ins>Parks</ins></em></a>. Inevitably we reached the point in the evening where people’s attention started to stray so it seemed like a good idea to switch to party video games. But instead of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jackbox-games-practice-friends-203026096.html">old standby Jackbox</a>, I remembered that <a href="https://oinkgames.com/en">Oink Games </a>had just released a board game collection and decided to give that a spin.</p><p>We discovered that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/lets-play-oink-games-switch/"><em>Let’s Play! Oink Games</em></a> was not like <em>Jackbox Party Packs</em> at all, as it did not work with phones and required separate copies of the game on separate consoles. Pass. So we turned off the Switch, hooked up my laptop and started up <a href="https://amzn.to/3ppDbbX"><em>Jackbox Party Pack 8</em></a> instead.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you live in a friendless cave and aren’t familiar with Jackbox, it’s a pretty great series: Each “Party Pack” has five party games that anyone can join in with their phone (or any web browser) by going to Jackbox.tv and inputting the special room code. The narrator explains how to play and walks the group through each round — which makes it pretty great for those guests who aren’t paying attention or are super, super drunk. Most of the games involve drawing, trivia or writing silly words. (My particular favorite is ‘Mad Verse City’ from <em>Jackbox Party Pack 5</em>, a rap game.)</p><div id="0d9cdd47dad8453aa5f58475b6f5825b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzY1YlPAHWw?rel=0&amp;start=4" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>After everyone left, I decided to give <em>Let’s Play! Oink Games</em> another try. And, while it isn’t an alternative to Jackbox (it’s more like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clubhouse-Games-Worldwide-Classics-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B086Z9D3TD?crid=2XRGNV120KACL&amp;keywords=clubhouse%2Bgames&amp;qid=1640550977&amp;sprefix=clubhouse%2Bgames%2Caps%2C84&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=cctbuyersguide21-20&amp;linkId=b03eeb789ae6988409cb504fc495e7c6&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><em>Clubhouse Games</em></a>, if anything), it is still a somewhat fun experience, though not worth the $22 I spent.</p><p>There are only four games included with the set: <em>Startups</em>, <em>Deep Sea Adventure</em>, <em>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</em>, and<em>‘Moon Adventure</em>. They’re all computerized versions of Oink’s tabletop games, which come in little card-deck-sized boxes and usually cost $20 each. In that respect, the video game version does seem like a good deal. You have a choice to play online with either people you know or strangers, offline with people you know, or offline with CPU opponents.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60dbdc30-68ba-11ec-b4be-f2103e0f49f2" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Let&#39;s Play!

I tried to find an online match, only to discover there weren’t any going on. So my only choice was offline with CPU opponents.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</em> can’t be played with CPU opponents, as it’s a drawing game where all the players but one are given a prompt, and you have to figure out who the “fake” artist is. I also discovered that <em>Moon Adventure</em> can have multiple players, but the user is tasked with playing them all since it’s a cooperative game. So it’s really a battle with resource management as you attempt to gather supplies before your oxygen runs out. I found this one the toughest of all, even after looking at the helpful instructions and videos the game builds in. For all my qualms with the title, the instructions are really well-done.</p><section data-eng-breakout="2742e1a9b51d417f80b25d1fd37d7e80" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60dbdc30-68ba-11ec-ae3f-ea886448a402" alt="Let&#39;s Play! Oink Games: Startup game" data-uuid="47d7e165-937a-3dd7-8a72-dfa21d2d62fe"></section><p>However, the instructions didn’t get me any closer to winning Startups, one of the two games where CPU players can participate. And man, are they merciless. The idea is to gather as many “shares” in a company as possible, but if you don’t have the most you end up having to pay out to the person who does. It’s like a modern version of Monopoly where you land on Boardwalk all the time. At least this one plays a lot quicker.</p><p>The last game, <em>Deep Sea Adventure</em>, is my favorite. It’s sort of competitive and sort of cooperative, as all the players must share the same oxygen supply and diving too deep will deplete it quickly. Once I got into the rhythm of gathering treasure and running back to the sub as soon as possible I mastered the game and was regularly kicking CPU butt.</p><p>While it was perhaps unfair of me to expect <em>Let’s Play: Oink Games</em> to be a <em>Jackbox</em> replacement, there’s still a lot of room for growth in what they have. I’d like to see a mode where users who don’t own the game can play on their own systems with a person who does, similar to how Mario Kart used to work on the DS. And I do hope they add more games, if only because this is an easier way to learn how to play instead of trying to puzzle out badly translated print instructions from Japanese, which is what you deal with in the physical versions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lets-play-oink-games-jackbox-irl-160044668.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1f34e139-156c-4e52-9aff-6ea33e024c73</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640791766</ingested><modified>2021-12-29T15:29:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/aab0c500-68ba-11ec-8dba-075611dce43a" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/aab0c500-68ba-11ec-8dba-075611dce43a" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oink Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Let's Play!
