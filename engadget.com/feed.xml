SpaceX and NASA expect to lauch the Crew Dragon capsule from Cape Canaveral at 9:03PM Eastern, and you can watch the livestream either here using the company&#39;s YouTube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZvtrnFItNs">channel</a>, through the SpaceX <a href="https://www.spacex.com/launches/index.html">website</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg">NASA TV</a>. Live coverage starts at 4:45PM ET.</p><p>This is an instantaneous launch window, so any faults or weather issues will prompt officials to delay Crew-3 liftoff to a &quot;backup&quot; on November 11th at 8:40PM ET. SpaceX and NASA pinned previous setbacks on weather, a minor crew medical issue and the desire to make way for Crew-2&#39;s (since successful) return.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is SpaceX&#39;s fifth crewed spaceflight. If all goes well, mission commander Raja Chari and crew members Tom Marshburn, Kayla Barron and Matthias Maurer (the latter from the ESA) will dock with the International Space Station on November 11th at 7:10PM ET. They&#39;ll conduct science and otherwise participate in station activities until April 2022.</p><div id="5e90abdfc1dd41cd850f95283d923067"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZvtrnFItNs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/watch-spacex-crew-3-livestream-213038925.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f82c436-13d1-4328-b2b6-deb626d94d7a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 21:30:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636576980</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T20:43:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/88a234d0-4263-11ec-b3b6-9cc9c69b5fdb" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/88a234d0-4263-11ec-b3b6-9cc9c69b5fdb" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SpaceX, Flickr]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SpaceX Crew-3 mission at launch pad]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SpaceX Crew-3 mission at launch pad]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple adds ProRes and ProRAW support to the the Windows iCloud app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> has bolstered its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/icloud/9pktq5699m62">iCloud for Windows app</a>, with the latest version now offering support for the <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/prores">ProRes</a> video and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/proraw">ProRAW</a> photo formats.

As we previously reported, one of the provisions included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/infrastructure-bill-drunk-driving-technology-173739727.html">a mandate for anti-drunk driving technology</a> in new cars. Now, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-faces-fresh-challenges-infrastructure-050328752.html">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act has passed Congress</a> with the measure intact, <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/11/10/drunk-driving-car-technology-infrastructure-bill/"><em>Autoblog (AP) reports</em></a>, and it&#39;s expected to be signed by the President soon. As part of the legislation, carmakers will have to include technology to detect and stop drunk drivers by as early as 2026.</p><p>First, though, the Department of Transportation will have to determine the best solution to curtail intoxicated drunk driving. Specifically, the bill requires something that will “passively monitor the performance of a driver of a motor vehicle to accurately identify whether that driver may be impaired.” That sounds similar to infrared camera solutions already used today by GM, Nissan and others, Sam Abuelsamid, principal mobility analyst for Guidehouse <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/honda/insight/">Insights</a>, tells the <em>AP</em>. It goes without saying that we&#39;d need something more advanced than breathalyzers, which are already used as a punishment for convicted drunken drivers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Around 10,000 people die every year in the US from drunk driving accidents, the <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/risky-driving/drunk-driving">NHTSA says</a>. Now that we have smarter sensors and plenty of camera technology to monitor driver behavior, it makes sense to explore solutions that could help prevent those sorts of accidents. Within a decade, it should feel as commonplace as seatbelts.&nbsp;</p><p>The infrastructure bill also includes other safety measures, like rear seat reminders that could notify parents about children left in carseats. Additionally, Congress will also require automatic emergency braking and lane departure warnings, features that many new cars already offer. It&#39;s unclear when true self-driving cars will be a reality, but until then, at least human drivers can look forward to more ways to prevent accidents.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/congress-mandate-anti-drunk-driving-technology-cars-201820120.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8936c47c-ccda-40c7-904f-02df1e7d2fe8</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 20:30:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636576664</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T20:37:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/44e47bd0-098f-11eb-bbdf-7c8f51db2836" width="5200" height="3467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/44e47bd0-098f-11eb-bbdf-7c8f51db2836" width="5200" height="3467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[3980290905 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bokeh night lights]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bokeh night lights]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valve's Steam Deck won't ship until 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3084396982306430712">delayed</a> the launch of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html">Steam Deck</a> by two months. The handheld PC will now start shipping sometime in February 2022 — instead of December of this year, as previously announced. The company blamed the delay on the ongoing global semiconductor crunch that has affected everything from GPU prices to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-halts-car-production-chip-shortages-200334864.html">car production</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We’re sorry about this — we did our best to work around the global supply chain issues, but due to material shortages, components aren’t reaching our manufacturing facilities in time for us to meet our initial launch dates,&quot; Valve <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3084396982306430712">said</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you pre-ordered a Steam Deck before today, you will keep your current place in the reservation line, but the date when your Steam Deck will ship is moving back.

Both nations said they recognized a gap between current actions and the Paris agreement target of keeping that warming below 2C, and ideally no higher than 1.5C.</p><p>The exact terms weren&#39;t available as of this writing, but US climate envoy John Kerry said China committed to reducing methane emissions and coal use &quot;as fast as is achievable.&quot; China wouldn&#39;t, however, join a US-Europe initiative to cut methane emissions by a third no later than 2030.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether or not this translates to meaningful action is far from clear. China has made some efforts to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-baidu-teaming-with-geely-on-electric-vehicle-090704201.html">promote electric vehicles</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-26-china-raises-renewable-energy-target-to-reduce-coal.html">reduce coal dependence</a>, but it&#39;s still the largest contributor to emissions and hasn&#39;t radically reduced its harmful output. It also hasn&#39;t had much of a presence at COP26, with President Xi Jinping declining to show up where US President Joe Biden was happy to attend.</p><p>The US isn&#39;t immune to problems, either. While the Biden administration has promised to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-cut-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-half-124537297.html">halve greenhouse gas emissions</a> by 2030 and spur EV adoption, there&#39;s no guarantee it can pass legislation needed to honor its side of the pledge. That&#39;s also assuming the next White House doesn&#39;t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-20-trumps-plan-for-energy-independence-sacrifices-the-environment.html">undo previous environmental efforts</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s still rare to see the US and China agree on climate change issues, though, and the very existence of the pledge represents progress for China. The country hadn&#39;t previously acknowledged the impact of methane on global warming, for instance. That suggests China is at least aware of the scope of the problem, even if there&#39;s a long way to go before it addresses that problem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-china-climate-change-pledge-cop-26-194435337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc8c68e6-e1a3-40ab-99c1-46c2098b9d4b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 19:44:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636573495</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T19:44:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64699f40-3e67-11ec-b7dd-0cb40cc2537a" width="1440" height="961" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64699f40-3e67-11ec-b7dd-0cb40cc2537a" width="1440" height="961" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Phil Noble / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry speaks at a news conference during the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26), in Glasgow, Scotland, Britain, November 5, 2021.

Related to that, it will explore how blockchain technologies can create an additional way for creators to earn a living. Lastly, with help from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-twitter-open-social-media-standard.html"><ins>Bluesky</ins></a>, it will lead the company’s efforts to decentralize social media.</p><p>“There’s massive and growing interest among creators to use decentralized apps to manage virtual goods and currencies – Tess will focus here, with a long term goal of exploring how ideas from crypto can help us push the boundaries of what’s possible with identity, community and more,” Twitter said.</p><p>It’s not a surprise to see Twitter get more serious about crypto.

Social network head Adam Mosseri has <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1458468539812044803">revealed</a> that Instagram started testing its hinted-at &quot;Take a Break&quot; feature this week.

Mosseri hoped to launch the feature for everyone in December. He stressed that Instagram would &quot;take feedback&quot; and refine the design, so you might not have to worry if it doesn&#39;t function as you&#39;d hoped.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There may already be room for improvement. Like a previous time limit feature, Take a Break doesn&#39;t strictly enforce the pauses. You can simply tap &quot;done&quot; and continue scrolling.

Not that Instagram or its parent Meta have much choice. The company is under pressure from regulators and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">whistleblower Frances Haugen</a>, both of which have accused Meta of focusing too much on hooking users and not enough on caring for them.

Sometimes, they&#39;ll work for any customer with a large-enough bank account. <em>The Record</em><a href="https://therecord.media/cyber-mercenary-group-void-balaur-has-been-hacking-companies-for-years/">reports</a> that Trend Micro has <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/us/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/the-far-reaching-attacks-of-the-void-balaur-cybermercenary-group">identified</a> Void Balaur, a &quot;cybermercenary&quot; group that has struck both political and commercial targets since 2015. It primarily steals data to sell to whoever&#39;s willing to pay, whether that&#39;s a government or a fraudster.</p><p>Void Balaur was initially linked to attacks against human rights activists and journalists in Uzbekistan. More recently, it attacked Belarusian presidential candidates in 2020 and several political leaders in an unnamed Eastern European country. However, the hacking outfit also targeted executives and directors at a very large Russian company between 2020 and 2021, and has been attacking and selling data from telecoms, banks and cryptocurrency users. The group has been linked to the on-demand hacking site RocketHack.me.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear just where Void Balaur operates from, or whether it has official government support. There&#39;s some overlap between Void&#39;s targets and those of the Russia-backed APT28 (aka <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-fancy-bear-reportedly-hacked-us-agency-213304085.html">Fancy Bear</a> or Pawn Storm), but not enough to establish a clear link. And while the group has only ever advertised its services on Russian-language sites, it&#39;s not necessarily operating from Russia. We&#39;d add that Russia usually turns a blind eye to cybercriminals only so long as they don&#39;t attack Russian interests — Void doesn&#39;t have problems attacking Russian businesses.</p><p>The study illustrates the difficulty in pinpointing the nature of some hackers, let alone catching them. Cybermercenaries also pose a particularly severe threat as they&#39;re often happy to attack any target without reservations. It won&#39;t be surprising if there are more groups like Void Balaur that have simply gone undetected.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/void-balaur-cyber-mercenary-hacking-group-163522871.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e6f73ca4-4b39-4867-87b3-7f715e65e114</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 16:35:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636562126</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T16:35:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9cf73d60-df3d-11eb-b645-02303e4bc877" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9cf73d60-df3d-11eb-b645-02303e4bc877" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Witthaya Prasongsin via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close up of hands typing on laptop.

Whether they’re a painter, writer, musician or anything else. Something to get their creative juices flowing will be welcome. Trust us. There are countless ways to spur creativity and aid the creative process — many of which <a href="https://makingmusic.ableton.com/">don’t require spending any money</a>, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/headspace-new-york-state-of-mind-website-205305471.html">meditation</a> or simply taking a long walk. But there are tools out there that can help someone stretch beyond their comfort zone, or simply document and fine-tune their own ideas. From subscriptions, to books, to extremely bizarre instruments, here are the best gifts for the creative in your life.</p><h2><em>You Are an Artist </em>by <strong>Sarah Urist Green</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c46440-2dd2-11ec-ba9d-5a9250b7b827" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="1f7fd47c-32f1-3721-8688-e65bff503ba4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget / Penguin Books</div></figure><p>It might seem counterintuitive, but sometimes just being told what to do is a great way to spur creativity. Because, truth is, rarely is the actually creative part in the original idea, but rather in the execution of it. The problem is, once someone leaves school nobody is giving them assignments any more. That’s where <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:You Are an Artist" href="https://amzn.to/3FzcEPD"><em>You Are an Artist</em></a> comes in, a book compiled by Sarah Urist Green, the host of PBS’ <em>The Art Assignment</em> on YouTube. It’s a collection of 50 assignments crafted by a diverse set of artists to help get the creative on your list, well, creating.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Many of the assignments focus on visual arts, asking them to make endless copies of an image using a Xerox machine, or to take random photos of a location and make notes on details they might normally miss. But there are others that encourage them to hum or clap along with the sounds of traffic, or engage in word games. <em>You Are an Artist</em> is the sort of book they’ll probably revisit time and time again. <em>— Terrence O&#39;Brien, Managing Editor</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FzcEPD" id="ebdc0efcf41a4b96a31447574ff763d4" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy You Are an Artist at Amazon - $13</a><h2>Apple Pencil (second-gen)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/1557e020-c608-11ea-9e7e-db158d5192d4" alt="Apple Pencil 2nd generation" data-uuid="b370310d-93cd-4148-96e6-15a2ed508a46"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>The iPad has become a key tool for creatives over the years and arguably nothing has contributed to that more than the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Pencil" href="https://amzn.to/3Akmd16">Apple Pencil</a>. Most of the newest iPads support the second-generation Pencil and it’s admittedly much more convenient than the first purely for its magnetic charging method. But otherwise, the Apple Pencil is the best stylus I’ve ever used because it has little to no latency and that helps mimic the feeling of drawing with a traditional pen and paper.</p><p>While investing in a paper-like screen protector will blur the lines even further, you don’t have to do that to get an excellent experience from the Apple Pencil. Drawing is seamless, taking notes is a breeze (especially with iPadOS 15 if you use Apple’s Notes app) and the possibilities are endless once you get familiar with third-party programs like Procreate. Battery life is superb, too: I’ve spent hours drawing in Procreate or experimenting with different planner layouts in GoodNotes and I have yet to pause a session to recharge the Pencil. While the Apple Pencil hasn’t completely replaced traditional art forms for me, it’s certainly the most useful tool I own for when I want to be creative. <em>— Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Akmd16" id="af4bccea0e4243e7a02e607070d024c0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Apple Pencil (2nd gen) at Amazon - $129</a><h2>Astrohaus Freewrite smart typewriter</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c0bac0-2dd2-11ec-b6dc-a6b13463d287" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="64d9f49b-d71e-3c80-9bf6-6011ef8b6cd2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dan Cooper / Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Freewrite smart typewriter" href="https://fave.co/3lxet7w">Freewrite smart typewriter</a> is a niche device that would nonetheless make a wonderful present for any aspiring writer. Or, come to think of it, anyone who is already committed to the art of putting words to the page. The Freewrite combines an excellent mechanical keyboard with an E Ink display, and while it can get online to sync drafts to the web, that&#39;s the only thing it can do. There&#39;s no way to browse the web, play a game, or watch YouTube on the Freewrite, which makes it a lot easier to just sit down and get into a flow state. The E Ink screen and keyboard can take a little getting used to, but both things quickly become assets when just looking to get some writing done. And thanks to the low-power display, the Freewrite lasts for a week or two of heavy writing.

It takes you back to basics, explaining the proper techniques behind different ways of cooking, so that you can understand what’s happening to your food as you prepare it. And don’t worry, it doesn’t read like a textbook and there are even complete recipes in there for you to follow if you wish.

That’s probably the most straightforward way to describe this book, which walks you through a 12-week program of writing exercises and tasks, all aimed at freeing up your creative powers. The crux of it is demanding three pages of handwritten writing every day. While it’s often a stream of consciousness — and if your handwriting is atrocious, barely legible — Cameron’s advice is to simply put the writing out there, and see where it takes you. Famous fans include <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em> author Elizabeth Gilbert, Alicia Keys and practically half of the comedians whose podcasts I listen to, it seems. The book does get a little bit spiritual at times, which you may or may not be fine with, but the core exercises and ideas can be pretty powerful, especially if you’re in a creative rut, or simply looking to add more artistic output to your day-to-day life. <em>— Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2YKjwc8" id="e7c321ea740a4676873d9d320830fec9" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy The Artist&#39;s Way at Amazon - $25</a><h2>Moog Subharmonicon</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c1f340-2dd2-11ec-ae77-5f2d8cdfd31a" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="028ed964-5764-3564-85c8-7d0bb2a5089a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Moog</div></figure><p>Another slightly weird instrument to consider is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Moog Subharmonicon" href="https://amzn.to/3FErV1x">Moog Subharmonicon</a>.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-31-sensel-morph-trackpad-review.html">Sensel Morph</a> is an impressively portable and flexible MPE MIDI controller with amazing shapeshifting possibilities. It can be a piano, a pad-based drum machine, a sketch pad, or an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchla_Thunder">obscure controller</a> inspired by Don Buchla — the driving force of West Coast-style synthesis.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buchla Thunder overlay" href="https://fave.co/3FBbDGR">Buchla Thunder overlay</a> marries the expressive possibilities of the Morph with an approach to composing melodies and harmonies that it’s fairly safe to assume your giftee has never experienced. Instead of a traditional piano layout it’s a series of pads organized into a roughly bird-like shape that you’re supposed to tap and slide along to create unique timbres. Its unfamiliarity forces anyone to stop thinking about what they already know about playing music and focus instead on the results.</p><p>Plus, the Morph has a number of other overlays so, if the Thunder has worn out its welcome, it’s still incredibly useful and flexible. <em>— T.O.</em></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3FBbDGR" id="397454f5403c40d8ac915981b80e0a62" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Sensel;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Morph with Thunder overlay at Sensel - $269</a><h2>Splice Creator plan</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b2c1a520-2dd2-11ec-bfde-dcf9c706f331" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="32a53501-11a9-380a-ace5-00723bf6f7f0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Splice </div></figure><p>Sure it’s easy to just grab a drum loop from the top of the Splice charts and wind up sounding like everyone else. But there are far more interesting ways to find sounds. For one, search results can be shuffled. So, rather than just using the same Rhodes sample that thousands of other bedroom producers have relied on, a person can hit the shuffle button and grab something that might be flying under the radar. This technique can also be combined with searching for random terms on Splice, rather than pulling up specific instruments. (Just Google “random word generator” and use that as the basis for a search.) There are lots of interesting and sometimes strange sounds and loops to be found by searching for things like “clinic” and “preparation.”</p><p>The entry-level $10 Sounds+ plan includes 100 sample credits.

He is joined by a group of former Nike employees which have worked to build the clothes and finesse this system of weighting clothes.

Then, sometime during lockdown, all of the cat food was suddenly sold out.

On top of that, the food looked high-quality, with natural ingredients and 50 percent more protein than the industry standard. I decided to try it out, and my household hasn&#39;t looked back. The cat absolutely loves it and we like that there are 16 different flavors so she’ll never get bored.

Back then, the commission decided after a lengthy investigation that the tech giant favored its own comparison shopping services and unfairly directed users to its own products over those of its rivals&#39;. That $2.8 billion fine is just a tiny fraction of Alphabet&#39;s (Google&#39;s parent company) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/alphabet-hits-2-trillion-market-value-after-71-rally-this-year?sref=10lNAhZ9">$2 trillion valuation</a>, but it was the biggest financial penalty the commission has ever handed out.</p><p>&nbsp;The court said in a statement:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;The General Court finds that, by favoring its own comparison shopping service on its general results pages through more favorable display and positioning, while relegating the results from competing comparison services in those pages by means of ranking algorithms, Google departed from competition on the merits.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While the General Court mostly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/google-loses-battle-with-eu-as-court-upholds-2017-order.html">sided</a> with the commission&#39;s findings that Google&#39;s actions had harmful effects on comparison shopping, it disagreed with one element of the EU&#39;s case.

The company could appeal the General Court&#39;s decision yet again by taking the case to the EU&#39;s highest court, the European Court of Justice. A spokesperson told <em>The Journal</em>, however, that the company will still have to review the judgment more closely before deciding whether to file another appeal.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-loses-appeal-eu-antitrust-comparison-shopping-125544574.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e1fcef97-c741-4ff7-96d1-548568599aa2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:55:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636548973</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T12:56:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5fb002c0-4220-11ec-b8fc-34d845d91de2" width="5417" height="2928" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5fb002c0-4220-11ec-b8fc-34d845d91de2" width="5417" height="2928" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PierreOlivierClementMantion via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dublin, Ireland - February 12, 2019: Architectural detail of the Irish headquarters building of the multinational Google on a winter day]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Architectural detail of the Irish headquarters building of the multinational Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Peloton reveals its smart camera for strength training]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can’t keep a fitness company down.

You can tell your robot vacuum to start and stop cleaning, or to set up a schedule, but the entire interaction is, well, <em>robotic</em>. That changes today with iRobot&#39;s latest Alexa Skill, which taps into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-genius-home-intelligence-bravaa-040110893.html">company&#39;s Genius software platform</a> to deliver smarter and more conversational voice commands.</p><p>You&#39;ll be able to tell Wi-Fi connected Roombas to clean around specific objects, and you can schedule cleaning jobs without sounding like you&#39;re inputting a computer program. As iRobot CEO Colin Angle tells us, the Alexa Skill is one of the most complex ever created. You can even tie a bunch of commands together, even across iRobots vacuums and Bravaa mop. For example, you can shout &quot;Alexa, tell Roomba to clean my dining room every Sunday at 4PM <em>and</em> then run Bravaa.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, iRobot&#39;s devices will also be able to use Alexa speakers to send announcements about cleaning jobs. Sure, the company&#39;s app already sends you phone notifications, but it&#39;s easy to miss those if you&#39;re cleaning up the house while Roomba works. iRobot devices can also tap into Alexa&#39;s AI-driven Hunches to start cleaning jobs if it thinks you aren&#39;t home. (Hopefully, there&#39;ll be plenty of control about how exactly that feature works.)</p><p>According to Angle, iRobot has a fundamental belief that you&#39;re supposed to be able to talk to your robots, and &quot;do so in a natural and sophisticated fashion.&quot; When Amazon was first developing Alexa, he says, one of the earliest concepts discussed was being able to use voice commands to control Roombas. Given iRobot&#39;s push towards making its device smarter — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">latest Roomba </a>has enough cameras and processing smarts to detect objects, even dog poop — it was only a matter of time until it focused more on voice support.</p><p>While iRobot&#39;s software platform taps into the maps Roombas create around your floorplans, Angle says the company isn&#39;t sharing any data with Amazon. Similarly, he claims iRobot isn&#39;t learning anything from Amazon either. Still, the two companies had to work together to ensure that a complex string of voice commands could work properly with Alexa. And looking ahead, iRobot plans to add even more features, like the ability to set a Do Not Disturb time for cleaning jobs.</p><p>It&#39;ll be interesting to see how much Roomba customers will actually want to talk with their robots. I&#39;ve used the company&#39;s original Alexa skill since it launched, but I still end up starting cleaning jobs from my phone most of the time. I&#39;m also hoping we&#39;ll eventually see these voice smarts on platforms other than Amazon&#39;s. Angle says the company is working with Google about optimizing its Home skill, but Apple hasn&#39;t been as receptive (at least you can get some <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/18/irobot-roomba-siri-control/">Siri support with IFTTT</a>).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-smarter-alexa-skill-voice-commands-120027590.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c75892be-df92-4503-bcf6-babcbd047dc6</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636518171</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T04:23:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9161d080-41dc-11ec-b7f5-e86006f2e3d9" width="2048" height="1536" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9161d080-41dc-11ec-b7f5-e86006f2e3d9" width="2048" height="1536" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roomba j7+ with Alexa]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roomba j7+ with Alexa]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iOS 15.2 beta introduces nearby AirTag searches and Legacy Contacts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is introducing another way to ensure its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> won&#39;t be used for stalking when iOS 15.2 comes out. According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, the beta version of the mobile platform that has just come out has a new feature that will let users scan for AirTags that may be tracking their location.

Apple will then point users to a set of instructions on how to disable the device that&#39;s being used to track them.

For users that hide AirTags in bikes, other items thieves could steal and even their pets&#39; collars, this could prevent them from catching the culprit and retrieving their property.

The UK’s Supreme Court has ruled that it cannot allow a US-style Class Action suit to be lobbed at the search giant after it deliberately created a workaround to track Safari users. The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0213-judgment.pdf">judgment</a>, read by Lord Leggatt, was focused on procedural matters, like the intersection between Google, based in the US, and the UK’s data protection laws. More importantly, however, was the issue of “damage,” and the fact that the claimants — led by consumer rights champion Richard Lloyd — had not established that any material harm had been caused by Google’s workaround.</p><p>The story begins in 2017 with Lloyd, and many others, formed a group called “Google You Owe Us” to attempt to sue the company. It alleged that Google had illegally collected data on iPhone users between June 2011 and February 2012 in violation of UK law. The matter hinged on the fact that Google had deliberately created a workaround to get access to data it was not otherwise entitled to. Lloyd and crew <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-google-safari-workaround-uk-lawsuit-dismissed.html">lost at the High Court</a>, but this initial decision was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-google-safari-privacy-lawsuit-to-continue.html">overturned by the UK’s Court of Appeal</a>, saying that it was quite proper for Google to face a courtroom after the intentional misuse of personal data without consent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>US-style Class Action lawsuits are not common, or even <em>really a thing</em> in UK law, although it is possible for a large group of litigants to bring a joint action. Lloyd and his cohort were trying to establish that Google’s tracking was, in and of itself, harmful, and by extension a standard level of compensation could be calculated. This was the fact that the Supreme Court rejected most clearly — saying that a set figure (reportedly pegged around £750 (around $1,000) per affected user) was not fair redress.</p><p>David Barker of <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/analysis/lloyd-v-google-supreme-court-representative-action">Pinsent Masons</a> — the firm Google hired to fight this case — wrote that the decision upholds the notion that compensation can only be asked for where real harm has been caused. And that, put simply, Google’s aggregation of personal data was insufficient to cause any real-world harm or mental distress. Richard Lloyd, who brought the action, told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/mass-legal-action-against-google-blocked-by-supreme-court-12465082"><em>Sky News</em></a> that he was “bitterly disappointed” that the court had “failed to do enough to protect the public from Google and other Big Tech firms who break the law.” And that this ruling, in effect, is the writing of a blank check for large technology companies to keep misusing user data without fear of censure. He added that it is time for government leaders to step in and craft laws to better clamp down on the misuse of personal data.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-supreme-court-blocks-google-safari-privacy-lawsuit-104432598.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">76c693ae-0b96-4ba5-9d1c-083eb1d45d8d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 10:44:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636541075</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T10:44:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80ca2a20-4212-11ec-bdfe-7ed9bb8171fc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80ca2a20-4212-11ec-bdfe-7ed9bb8171fc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2019/08/23: The exterior view of the entrance to the global internet search company Google office in London.
