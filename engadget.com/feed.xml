The <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3161717/china-gaming-crackdown-freeze-new-video-game-licences-extends-2022"><em>SCMP</em></a> says that the National Press and Publication Administration (NPPA) has not issued a new license to a game developer since July 2021. And that, as a consequence, a number of local firms have been forced to exit the business, while some of the larger players are looking to move operations overseas. It’s not clear if the NPPA’s inaction is the direct cause of these closures, especially given the broader debt crisis in China, but there’s a belief that something is up.</p><p>The NPPA has reportedly been tight-lipped about why it’s suddenly decided to stop issuing licenses, but you can likely guess why. China spent much of 2021 amplifying its already fierce criticism of video games, with a key state-owned news outlet describing them as “spiritual opium” in the summer. At the end of August 2021, limits on how long minors could play some titles was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-cuts-kids-gaming-time-132539606.html">slashed to just three hours a week</a>.

As part of her <a href="https://www.regeringen.dk/nyheder/2022/statsminister-mette-frederiksens-nytaarstale/">New Year’s Address</a>, she said that (translated) “by 2025, Danes must have the opportunity to fly green on a domestic route.” She added that “by 2030 at the latest, we must be able to fly completely green when we fly domestically in Denmark.” It was part of a broader commitment by the leader to toughen measures against polluters and to jump-start the country’s green transition.</p><p>There are, however, reasons to be concerned that such an ambitious deadline can be reached, given the lack of ready alternatives. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html">Electric planes may never succeed</a>, and hydrogen flying, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-29-hydrogen-fuel-cell-toyota-mirai-evs.html">while much more promising</a>, is nowhere near ready to be rolled out to a major airline’s fleet. Not to mention, of course, that only hydrogen produced as a result of electrolysis, powered by excess renewable energy, can be called truly “green.” <a href="https://energiwatch.dk/Energinyt/Politik___Markeder/article12437427.ece"><em>EnergiWatch</em></a> has said that Denmark’s standing policy of waiting for magic bullet technologies to come to fruition is not going to help it reach its international commitments on climate emissions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, Denmark has made more steps than some countries to help make the transition toward zero-carbon technologies. The country has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/denmark-to-end-offshore-oil-gas-pumping-by-2050-162837374.html">issued a hard deadline</a> to end oil and gas exploration and is a big player in the wind power industry. At the start of 2021, it committed to build an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/denmark-energy-island-north-sea-wind-power-140022879.html">artificial island</a> which could collect and store power from Denmark’s wind farms, enough to supply 10GW. At the same time, the country hopes that any excess wind power can be used to drive an electrolyzer, helping it develop a nice sideline as a producer of guilt-free Hydrogen.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/denmark-pledges-green-domestic-flights-by-2030-101536240.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2001297e-d119-458d-92eb-567c9196dd9d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 10:15:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641202848</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T09:40:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/879e5a20-6c78-11ec-bffb-0cd8e5d823cd" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/879e5a20-6c78-11ec-bffb-0cd8e5d823cd" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airbus A320 SAS Airlines.

That&#39;s the basic idea behind Alienware&#39;s Concept Nyx, a server that&#39;s powerful enough to run all of your games throughout your home network.

You could conceivably run two games at once on your television, as we saw during a recent demo in NYC. Or you could play <em>Cyberpunk</em> while someone else perfects their <em>Rocket League</em> skills on another device. Since all of the rendering and network processing is happening in your home, Nyx would also be a lower latency experience than traditional cloud gaming, which relies on servers hundreds of miles away.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Concept</em> is the key word here, though.

That&#39;s something we can already do with Steam&#39;s Remote Play feature, but perhaps Dell could make it a bit easier to play all of your titles throughout your home.

To start, the mainstream Neo QLED sets now include what <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a> says are the first 4K and 8K sets with 144Hz inputs instead of the usual 120Hz. The extra fluidity won&#39;t be immediately useful when even the fastest PCs struggle with high-speed 4K and 8K content, but you won&#39;t have to worry about your premium TV becoming obsolete any time soon.</p><p>The TVs promise image quality improvements regardless of the source. All the 8K and 4K Neo QLED sets have jumped from a 12-bit backlight to 14-bit, providing more accurate brightness. They also boast a new Shape Adaptive Light Control feature that theoretically improves the mini-LED sets&#39; quality, and an AI-driven Object Depth Enhancer can help distinguish a picture&#39;s main subject from its background.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Software plays an important role as well. All the 2022 Samsung TVs have a new home screen that helps aggregate streaming content and offers an ambient display when idle. A Gaming Hub can directly launch console- and cloud-based games, while a new Game Bar helps you customize relevant picture settings. Watch Together is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">SharePlay</a>-style mode that lets you talk to distant friends while you watch broadcasts and streaming shows. And since this is 2022, you can even shop for and display <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">NFTs</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f01be3d0-6c17-11ec-9bfb-c507f83e0a49" alt="Samsung MicroLED TV (2022)" data-uuid="7c0958fc-917b-35cc-bf81-3a0921d582b5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>Other sets have their own share of upgrades. Samsung&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-microled-tvs-ces-160052013.html">MicroLED line</a> (shown at middle) is now bezel-free, so your giant luxury TV should blend more seamlessly with your decor. They also tout a 10 percent wider color range, and you can buy a &#39;small&#39; 89-inch preconfigured set if the 99- and 110-inch variants won&#39;t quite fit. And if the bezels are precisely what you want, 2022 The Frame (below) sets now have more canvas-like matte displays and a fresh art store interface.</p><p>As is often the case, Samsung hasn&#39;t provided availability and price ranges as of this writing. The Frame will be available in sizes between 32 and 85 inches, though, and you can presume both 8K screens and MicroLED models will carry stiff premiums. It&#39;s too soon to say whether they&#39;ll compete well against rival models <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-ex-enhance-brightness-30-percent-095813152.html">from LG</a>, Sony and other brands. With that said, it&#39;s evident Samsung still isn&#39;t in a rush to embrace OLED TVs and counter its best-known challengers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/55cd5e20-6c18-11ec-9998-1be77eca943e" alt="Samsung The Frame TV (2022)" data-uuid="fb4af850-3b71-33ce-acc0-553207405fe1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2022-qled-microled-8k-4k-tv-020046596.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e48f21dd-628f-4403-9cd1-46dee26e1ad1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 02:00:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641216635</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T13:30:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8e0d0bb0-6c17-11ec-ae75-15522ac2e777" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8e0d0bb0-6c17-11ec-ae75-15522ac2e777" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN800B TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN800B TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's baking its cloud gaming platform into TVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung" href="https://fave.co/31Ygak3">Samsung</a> is overhauling its TV interface, and it&#39;s looking to pull many of your gaming needs together in one place.

As users discovered, Exchange was trying to store version date checks for its antivirus scanning engine in a 32-bit integer variable — a big problem when any date from January 1st, 2022 onward was too large. Any new checks made the malware engine crash and left email stuck in a queue.</p><p>The emergency fix uses a PowerShell script to pause two services, replace the older antivirus engine files with newer ones that use a new number sequence, and restart operations.

The timing is also &#39;ideal&#39; as a holiday weekend likely limited the demand for email. Company IT managers probably didn&#39;t want to start 2022 patching servers, though, and it&#39;s unclear why Microsoft didn&#39;t foresee a date issue with software released just a few years ago.

It even jumps to a 4K resolution — this is the first 4K monitor to support 240Hz and a 1ms pixel response time, Samsung claimed. Support for both NVIDIA&#39;s G-Sync and AMD&#39;s FreeSync Premium Pro should keep tearing artifacts to a minimum.</p><p>There&#39;s no mention of a price or ship date for the Odyssey Neo G8.

The companies argued that the government&#39;s proposed plan would effectively give oversight of the network expansions to the FAA for an &quot;undetermined number of months or years,&quot; and wouldn&#39;t cover rivals like T-Mobile.</p><p>The move would represent an &quot;irresponsible abdication&quot; of network control, the CEOs said. They also believed honoring the request would be to the &quot;detriment&quot; of customers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instead, AT&amp;T and Verizon tried to negotiate a compromise. They vowed not to deploy C-band 5G towers near some airports for six months, but only so long as the aviation industry and regulators didn&#39;t do more to halt C-band deployments. American transportation agencies had asked on December 31st for a general delay no longer than two weeks, but called for a gradual deployment of service near &quot;priority&quot; airports through March to safeguard important runways.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear how the FAA and Transportation Department will respond. The rejection isn&#39;t shocking, mind you. C-band service promises to deliver more of the long-touted speed advantages of 5G without the short range and poor indoor service of millimeter wave technology. It could also add capacity to keep 5G networks running smoothly as more users upgrade their devices. However, officials and the aviation industry have a lot to lose as well —they&#39;re worried C-band 5G could disrupt flights and put passengers at risk. You might not see either side capitulate quickly.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-reject-us-5g-c-band-delay-191634365.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2c18d09-3330-4693-9c5d-36b4a145af7f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 19:16:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641150999</ingested><modified>2022-01-02T19:17:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/6592a650-5501-11eb-9feb-aa635a78297e" width="5100" height="3400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/6592a650-5501-11eb-9feb-aa635a78297e" width="5100" height="3400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Education Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Side by side ATT and Verizon store fronts and entrances at a mall in northern Idaho.

The company has <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q4-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries">revealed</a> that it delivered 936,172 electric cars in 2021, about 308,600 of them in the fourth quarter. While that isn&#39;t the magic 1 million figure the company might have hoped for, it&#39;s close — and nearly double the 499,550 Tesla handed to customers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/teslas-transformative-fourth-quarter-tops-a-full-year-of-positive-revenue-000902903.html">in 2020</a>.</p><p>The year gone by wasn&#39;t stellar for the Model S and Model X.

Tesla had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-had-a-phenomenal-2021-150044600.html">mixed 2021</a> that included product delays (including the Cybertruck and Semi), gradual price hikes and a string of recalls, including one in December that targeted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-3-s-camera-trunk-recall-142249417.html">half a million vehicles</a> with camera and trunk flaws.

Square Enix President Yosuke Matsuda has <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2022/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_2.html">published</a> a New Year&#39;s letter indicating that decentralized games using technologies like blockchain will be a &quot;major strategic theme&quot; for the company from 2022 onward. Matsuda didn&#39;t name titles, but he did hint at how future releases would incorporate the distributed technology.</p><p>The company would incorporate token economies to foster &quot;self-sustaining game growth,&quot; Matsuda said. While the leader understood many people would be skeptical, he believed at least some gamers wanted to &quot;play to contribute.&quot; Blockchain games theoretically provide a direct incentive to those players to build their own content instead of relying on &quot;goodwill and volunteer spirit.&quot; The suggestion, at least, is that users would make items in part to earn rewards.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Matsuda didn&#39;t directly announce plans for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">NFTs</a> in Square Enix games. He expected those tokens to become mainstream over time, though, and believed the &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/edward-snowden-nft-sold-for-55-million-080508241.html">overheated trading</a>&quot; for them would cool down. Don&#39;t be shocked if you can buy NFTs in the company&#39;s games at some point.</p><p>Square Enix would keep watch on trends in the market and develop accordingly. The president was optimistic, however, and suggested his firm might issue its own tokens. Whether or not the market follows suit is another story. Even a heavyweight publisher like Ubisoft has struggled with early NFT sales for games, and Square Enix isn&#39;t guaranteed to fare better even with hit series like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-delayed-six-months-due-to-covid-19-142140517.html"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a> in its lineup.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-blockchain-games-173640368.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4893dbdc-ad09-4d5a-9d72-1cc95a50c5bd</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 17:36:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641145003</ingested><modified>2022-01-02T17:36:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3402a2b0-6bea-11ec-bdb3-8d617c261d5c" width="4488" height="2992" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3402a2b0-6bea-11ec-bdb3-8d617c261d5c" width="4488" height="2992" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucy Nicholson / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Square Enix video game logo is seen at the Electronic Entertainment Expo, or E3, in Los Angeles, California, United States, June 17, 2015.

By further improving the audio quality, apparently. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/02/kuo-airpods-pro-2-to-offer-lossless-support-new-form-factor-more/">According</a> to <em>9to5Mac</em>, well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo claims Apple is launching its second-generation AirPods Pro in the fall with support for Apple Lossless (ALAC) audio. There&#39;s no mention of support for other lossless formats, unfortunately, but the rumored upgrade would at least ensure you could listen to Apple Music (and locally stored ALAC songs) without compromising on quality.</p><p>Kuo also expects the updated AirPods Pro to offer a &quot;new form factor design.&quot; You might not have to worry quite so much if you lose your earbuds, either — they&#39;ll supposedly include a charging case that can make sounds, much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a>. You might only have to &#39;ping&#39; your buds to find them on the sidewalk.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not certain if or how Apple would support its lossless format given Bluetooth&#39;s data pipe limitations. However,  company acoustics VP Gary Geaves recently told <em>What Hi-Fi</em> in an <a href="https://www.whathifi.com/features/is-bluetooth-holding-back-apples-airpods-we-asked-the-man-who-made-them">interview</a> that his team would &quot;like more bandwidth,&quot; teasing the possibility of new technology. Apple won&#39;t necessarily augment or replace wireless standards like Bluetooth, but it could develop an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-codec-announcement-161851075.html">aptX Lossless</a>-style codec to make wireless ALAC viable.</p><p>However accurate Kuo might be, we wouldn&#39;t count on lossless support just yet. The purported launch is still several months away, and Apple might cancel or delay plans. With that said, an upgrade strategy like this would make sense. While the AirPods Pro still have advantages like active noise cancellation and silicone eartips, the latest standard AirPods are much closer in terms of sound quality and features (like spatial audio) while offering longer battery life. The currently Pros are only truly a good value when you can find them on sale. Lossless music, a new design and a smarter case could help justify a higher price.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-2-lossless-audio-support-rumor-152945692.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7817ecb5-f57d-44cb-b353-126ea17c01c2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 15:29:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641137388</ingested><modified>2022-01-02T15:30:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/0cf63c10-af5b-11ea-b47d-2898c24eade1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/0cf63c10-af5b-11ea-b47d-2898c24eade1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AT&T and Verizon might delay 5G expansion again over FAA concerns]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past month, AT&amp;T and Verizon have been holding off on rolling out potentially faster <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html">C-band 5G service</a>, due to safety concerns from the Federal Aviation Administration. Now, it looks like an additional delay could be in store, once again over FAA concerns. The two major carriers had been scheduled on December 5 to use newly purchased frequencies to roll out C-band service, but delayed the launch to January 5 after the Department of Transportation raised concerns related to possible interference. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-officials-ask-att-verizon-delay-5g-wireless-over-aviation-safety-concerns-2021-12-31/">a letter obtained by <em>Reuters</em></a>, the Transportation Department and FAA are now asking for up to two more weeks to study the issue.</p><p>In the letter, sent by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and FAA Administrator Steve Dickson to the CEOs of AT&amp;T and Verizon, the pair asked for a delay of &quot;no more than two weeks.&quot; The two framed the request as part of a &quot;proposal as a near-term solution for advancing the co-existence of 5G deployment in the C-Band and safe flight operations,&quot; according to <em>Reuters</em>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At issue until now has been the possibility that pilots will use poor-weather safety system that could conflict with this new C-band 5G technology. The FAA would ultimately like to enact regulations that bar pilots from using such systems, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-t-verizon-to-delay-5g-rollout-over-faas-airplane-safety-concerns-11636039555"><em>The Wall Street Journal </em></a>reported in November. Aviation officials have claimed that C-band 5G has the potential to interfere with flights in and around the nearly four dozen cities where C-band towers are located. Telecoms have claimed there is no evidence that C-band 5G will jeopardize flight safety.</p><p>In the framework that <em>Reuters</em> describes in its report, the FAA would designate &quot;priority&quot; airports where &quot;a buffer zone would permit aviation operations to continue safely while the FAA completes its assessments of the interference potential.&quot;</p><p><em>Reuters</em> says that both companies say they have received the letter. But they have so far stopped short of agreeing to an additional two-week delay. Needless to say, this postponement would come as unwelcome news to both carriers. <em>Reuters</em> reports that on Friday, the companies accused the aviation industry of holding the C-band expansion &quot;hostage until the wireless industry agrees to cover the costs of upgrading any obsolete altimeters.&quot;</p><p>And in <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/buttigieg-delay-5g-service-airline-safety-concerns-verizon-wireless-att-2022-1">a statement to <em>Insider</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>on Saturday, a Verizon spokesperson said: &quot;If the airlines are so concerned about flight cancellations related to 5G, they should really look at their track record over the past two weeks,&quot; referring to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/30/business/flights-cancelled.html">a wave of recent cancellations</a> amid a surge in COVID-19 cases. &quot;This industry which got a $54 billion taxpayer-funded, government bail out over the past couple years clearly has much bigger issues to worry about.&quot;</p><p>As frustrated as executives from the two carriers might be, however, as <em>Reuters</em> notes the companies agreed to six months of precautionary measures when they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html">purchased the C-band spectrum in early 2021</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-5g-expansion-delay-faa-pete-buttigieg-224552929.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1405672b-47ec-4ea7-8635-84b2e907ab3a</guid><dc:creator>Dana Wollman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 22:45:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641076394</ingested><modified>2022-01-01T22:33:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Dana Wollman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b3c34c50-6b4c-11ec-bfe6-4e7b8e89fa5d" width="4774" height="3235" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b3c34c50-6b4c-11ec-bfe6-4e7b8e89fa5d" width="4774" height="3235" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GEORGE FREY via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TOPSHOT - A contract crew for Verizon, works on a cell tower to update it to handle the new 5G network in Orem, Utah on December 10,  2019. - The new 5G cellular network will substantially increase cellular network speeds, opening up new markets for business and individuals.

In October, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/soyuz-spacecraft-thruster-firing-turned-iss-122409715.html">surprise test fire</a> from a docked Russian spacecraft caused the ISS to tilt out of its normal position, leading personnel on board to briefly evacuate. (A fun footnote: The spacecraft that caused the incident had been in space so that a Russian crew could film<a href="https://www.engadget.com/international-space-station-russia-movie-the-challenge-183808670.html"> the first feature film</a> aboard the Space Station.) Then, in November, satellite debris <a href="https://www.engadget.com/international-space-station-debris-field-215745675.html">forced ISS astronauts to seek shelter</a> on the day as a Russian missile attack. The US condemned Russia for the attack. Russia did not acknowledge any wrongdoing.&nbsp;</p><p>Later that month, in an unrelated episode, Russia&#39;s space agency, Roscosmos, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roscosmos-2018-iss-report-174303244.html">left the door open for possible criminal charges</a> related to a 2018 incident involving a hole in one of its spacecraft, which Russian media insinuated could have been the result of US sabotage. &quot;These attacks are false and lack any credibility,&quot; Nelson <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/11/russia-threatens-criminal-charges-against-a-nasa-astronaut/?">told <em>Ars Technica</em></a> in November.</p><p>In its statement on Friday, NASA highlighted among its continuing projects sending humans to Mars, as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Project%20Artemis/">Project Artemis</a>, an effort to send the first woman and the first person of color to the Moon.

We set New Year’s resolutions with the best of intentions, but it’s no wonder that so many people fail after just a few weeks – old habits die hard. Just as it’s important to have a supportive group of people cheering you on during those particularly hard days, it’s also important to have tools that make it easier to achieve your goals. Whether you’re trying to get healthy, be more organized, or read more, there are tech tools that can make your journey a bit easier (and maybe even more enjoyable).</p><h2>Fitness tracker</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/4b7789e2-e632-11ea-bbd5-a22cf771a412" alt="Fitbit Inspire 2 fitness tracker" data-uuid="2fe7e163-029a-4d63-a0da-e1f0b2b6228f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fitbit</div></figure><p>A fitness tracker can help kickstart your exercise journey by passively monitoring your wins and showing you daily data about your steps, sleep patterns and more. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fitbit&#x002019;s Inspire 2" href="https://amzn.to/2ZZZnj7">Fitbit’s Inspire 2</a> is an all-around good option, not only because it’s fairly affordable at $100, but because it does pretty much everything a beginner would need a fitness tracker to do. It tracks daily steps, calories, heart rate, sleep and more, and it comes with 20 goal-based exercises that you can manually track or let the device’s automatic SmartTrack feature monitor for you. It also has 10-day battery life, so you rarely have to take it off to charge it. And with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-inspire-2-tile-tracking-130028749.html">built-in Tile functionality</a>, you’ll be able to more easily find the device if you do misplace it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Smartwatch</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7343f520-5db5-11ec-9776-245470b1b273" alt="Apple Watch SE" data-uuid="d45b3dbe-2e62-3f7b-b9a5-0959da9d9799"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’d rather invest in an all-purpose wearable that also has serious fitness chops, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Watch SE" href="https://amzn.to/3rGRN8f">Apple Watch SE</a> is a good choice. While it doesn’t include some of the bells and whistles that the Series 7 does, it still fferes the same core experience as any Apple Watch. It tracks all-day activity and heart rate, and watchOS finally does basic sleep tracking, too. In addition to  built-in GPS for outdoor workouts, it supports dozens of trackable exercises along with fall detection and high and low heart rate notifications. The Apple Watch also excels over basic fitness trackers when it comes to table-stakes smartwatch features: You’ll be able to send and receive text messages from the device, as well as control music playback, smart home devices and more.</p><h2>Workout classes</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/987db3b0-3b1c-11eb-9f1f-b34b932f444c" alt="Smiling sportswoman crouching, taking a break, and using phone after running in nature."><figcaption>millann via Getty Images </figcaption></figure><p>If running isn’t your thing, or it’s just inconvenient to do it where you live, finding exercise classes that you enjoy can make working out a habit you’re more likely to stick with for the long haul. You may prefer to do this through your local gym — that push to get out of the house and into a dedicated exercise space can be really effective for some — but there are plenty of online fitness classes as well that you can participate in from the comfort of your living room. I’ve tried my fair share of these services and my favorite has been <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Peloton" href="https://fave.co/3dJCK5T">Peloton</a>. No, you don’t need one of the company’s expensive bikes or treadmills to take advantage of their classes. Access to the app-only version of the subscription costs $13 per month and it lets you take HIIT, strength, yoga and even outdoor running classes, many of which require little to no equipment at all.</p><p>If you can’t afford another monthly subscription fee, the internet has tons of free exercise resources — you just have to work a little harder to find the ones you jive with most. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.fitnessblender.com/">Fitness Blender</a>, a free website where you can watch hundreds of workout videos and even set a schedule for yourself, assigning videos to specific days of the week. I like the quality and consistency of their videos, but you may connect more to YouTube workout videos if they’re taught by instructors you like; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Heatherrobertsoncom">Heather Robertson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/MoveWithNicole/featured">Move with Nicole</a> are two personal favorites.</p><h2>Habit tracker</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3d55ffc0-5db6-11ec-bfff-d84ee8a510a0" alt="Forest app" data-uuid="27d43642-aca4-3372-b494-4cd893d1f26a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Forest</div></figure><p>At least in the beginning, keeping track of new habits you’re trying to build can help you stick to them. While you can get deep into this subject if you wander down the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=habit+tracker+bullet+journal">bullet-journal rabbit hole</a>, a habit-tracking app is probably the easier option. <a href="https://thedoneapp.com/">Done</a> and <a href="https://www.stridesapp.com/">Strides</a> are two iOS options that let you log when you’ve completed a new habit you’re trying to build or when you avoided a bad habit that you’re trying to break. You can get pretty granular, customizing how often you want to do a task, setting reminders to log, reviewing stats and more. However, both apps have paid tiers to which you’ll be asked to subscribe after you create a few trackable habits.</p><p>If you’d rather avoid yet another subscription, consider an app like <a href="https://streaksapp.com/">Streaks</a>, which can be all yours for a one-time fee of $5. As for Android, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.przybylski.grow">Grow</a> is a free app that takes a similar approach to habit tracking that <a href="https://www.forestapp.cc/">Forest</a> takes with time management. Plant a virtual tree for each new habit tracked and watch it grow every time you log a completion. There’s also <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.habitrpg.android.habitica">Habitica</a>, which turns habit tracking to an 8-bit RPG game in which your custom avatar levels up every time you log a task.</p><h2>To-do and note-taking apps</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/05d98240-3bcc-11eb-bdfd-f127d1f859d6" alt="Things 3"><figcaption>Things 3 </figcaption></figure><p>The new year provides an opportunity to get back on track, and one way to do that is by finding organizational tools that work for you — and making sure those tools are as uncomplicated as possible. The worst thing that could happen is that your to-do list or note-taking system ends up being so cumbersome that you avoid using it. Keeping all of your necessary tasks in your head may work on easy days, but it can quickly get overwhelming when you have a million things to handle in both your personal and professional life. I’m a fan of <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things/">Things</a> for iOS and macOS because it’s detailed enough for big work projects, but simple enough for casual personal tasks. I also love the Today view, which shows me everything across all of my projects that requires immediate attention.</p><p>However, you’ll spend $80 to get Things for iOS, iPadOS and macOS — and it’s only available for Apple devices. <a href="https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/">Microsoft’s To Do</a> is an alternative that, while less involved than Things 3, is free and works on almost every platform including iOS, Android and Windows, among others. You can keep it simple and just have a task list and a grocery list, or you can go deeper and add due dates, sub-tasks and even share lists with family members. And if you don’t want to bother with an extraneous app, you can always opt for the reminders app that (most likely) came preinstalled on your phone. That would be Reminders for iOS users and Google Keep for Android users.</p><p>Google Keep also doubles as a note-taking app, which will be a better solution if you’ve been constantly jotting down ideas for new projects on Post-It notes or scraps of paper that you eventually lose. Apple Notes is the default option for this on iOS devices, and there are plenty of other note-taking apps out there as well. I’m partial to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Evernote" href="https://fave.co/3Im7GHg">Evernote</a> simply because it’s become my digital file box of sorts. I take notes in it almost every day, but tons of things like online order receipts, messages from my doctor’s office and e-signed contracts all come to me through my email and eventually get saved and tagged in Evernote so I can easily find them in the future.</p><h2>Password manager</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/7350afb0-888f-11ea-96fd-f8175b1f8740" alt="1Password password manager app."><figcaption>1Password </figcaption></figure><p>If you’re looking to up your organization game in the new year, a password manager is a great place to start. I’m partial to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:1Password" href="https://fave.co/3s6dIT2">1Password</a>, but there are plenty of other options including <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:LastPass" href="https://bit.ly/3kyFcjb">LastPass</a> (which has a free version), <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Bitwarden" href="https://fave.co/3ptqJH7">Bitwarden</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Dashlane" href="https://fave.co/3sgDOCJ">Dashlane</a>. After saving all of your passwords for various accounts, you only need to remember one (hence the name) to log in to your 1Password account and access all of the others. The service has browser extensions Chrome, Edge and others that will let you seamlessly log in with the proper credentials with just a few clicks, and 1Password has apps for most platforms including iOS and Android, so you can use it on all of your devices.</p><p>I also appreciate the Password Generator feature, which helps you create a new, secure password whenever one of yours has expired. LassPass has this too, and Dashlane even has a <a href="https://fave.co/3IO1Bnc">free tool</a> that anyone can use to make more secure passwords. Not only does this take the onus of coming up with a strong key off your shoulders, but it also makes it easy to override old credentials with new ones.</p><h2>Travel tech organizer</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/611e27c0-5db6-11ec-bfaf-551ae16b37ed" alt="Bellroy Desk Pouch" data-uuid="4da36da5-6d02-3300-9711-8c88ca1b8606"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bellroy</div></figure><p>One of the consequences of the past two is the dual-office life. Many of us now work both from home and from an office, and the last thing you want to do when you arrive in either place is rummage around your backpack only to realize that you’ve left your mouse, charging cable or dongle at your other desk.</p><p>An organizer bag can prevent this before it happens – we’re partial to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:BagSmart tech organizers" href="https://amzn.to/3dpAfpa">BagSmart tech organizers</a> thanks to their utilitarian, water-repellent designs and their multiple pockets and dividers. They also come in <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:different sizes" href="https://amzn.to/31uWlUl">different sizes</a>, so you can pick the best one for your commuter bag. If you want something a bit more elevated, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Bellroy&#x002019;s Desk Pouch" href="https://fave.co/3lESRWz">Bellroy’s Desk Pouch</a> is a good option. It’s pricier but for the money you get a more elegant design, with a higher-quality material (recycled nylon, weave or ripstop, depending on the color you choose) and a structured base that keeps the bag upright on your desk.</p><h2>Computer docking station</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/83b007d0-d654-11ea-aeff-c1042953df04" alt="CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt 3 dock" data-uuid="3732d3bf-0818-4f6f-9163-cff993f5255c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CalDigit</div></figure><p>It’s all too easy for your work-from-home setup to get really messy <em>really</em> quickly. When you’re going through your busiest times at work, the last thing you’re thinking about is cable management, but dedicating a bit more effort into tidying up your workspace can make your day to day more efficient and more enjoyable.</p><p>We recommend some sort of docking station to keep your laptop, monitors, accessories and the like in check. A couple good options are <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:CalDigit&#x002019;s TS3 Plus" href="https://amzn.to/3DuMR91">CalDigit’s TS3 Plus</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Plugable&#x002019;s Universal Docking Station" href="https://amzn.to/3IrqnJs">Plugable’s Universal Docking Station</a>. The former has a compact, rectangular design with a total of 16 different ports on it, including a Gigabit Ethernet jack, five USB-A connections, two Thunderbolt 3 sockets and analog audio in/out ports. The latter stands up vertically on your desk and has 13 connectors, including HDMI and DVI ports, six USB-A connections and a Gigabit Ethernet jack. That DVI port may be a deciding factor for you depending on which monitor you have, and Plugable’s device comes with both DVI to HDMI and DVI to VGA adapters.</p><p>While both of those options are stationary, there are plenty of adapters out there that can give you similar organization while on the go, albeit in a less elegant package. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anker&#x002019;s USB-C hub" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Upgraded-Delivery-Pixelbook-A83460A2/dp/B07ZVKTP53?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=buyersguide2021-20&amp;linkId=bbe8214279ab7872711167166f4664c0&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Anker’s USB-C hub</a> is an affordable solution that includes an HDMI port, microSD and SD card readers, two USB-C connections and two USB-A ports.

Not only is that hard to do when you’re starting from zero, but it’s especially tough because it takes more time than ordering in from your phone. But tools like an Instant Pot can make the process easier because it cuts your active cooking time down drastically. You can find a plethora of recipes in which you simply <a href="https://eatinginstantly.com/instant-pot-dump-dinners/">throw a bunch of ingredients into the pot</a>, set it and forget it until it’s time to eat.</p><p>We recommend the Instant Pot Duo for beginners because it’s relatively affordable and combines seven different cooking methods into one appliance, including rice cooking, steaming, pressure cooking, slow cooking and more. If you’re primarily cooking for yourself and a partner, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:three-quart model" href="https://amzn.to/3rEDt01">three-quart model</a> will serve you just fine, but we recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:six-quart model" href="https://amzn.to/3IoIH6d">six-quart model</a> if you’re routinely cooking for four or more.

You’ll want to keep those recipes safe and readily available so you can refer to them when you need a quick weeknight meal or a dish to bring to your next family reunion. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Recipe cards" href="https://amzn.to/3dlwot8">Recipe cards</a> are a great way to do this, and you’ll build up your rolodex of delicious meals over time. If you’d rather have a cookbook of sorts that you fill in yourself over time, opt for a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:recipe book" href="https://amzn.to/3GdlJwS">recipe book</a> instead.</p><p>If you’d rather keep your arsenal of recipes accessible at any time, anywhere from your phone, <a href="https://www.paprikaapp.com/">Paprika’s recipe management app</a> is the best solution I’ve tried. The $5 app basically acts as your digital recipe box, allowing you to enter recipes of your own as well as download them from the internet. You know those hundreds of words that precede online recipes, in which the author divulges their entire life story before telling you their secret to making deliciously moist cornbread? Paprika strips all of those unnecessary bits out and only saves the ingredient list and the instructions. You can also make grocery lists and keep track of pantry staples in the app, so don’t be surprised if it quickly becomes one of your most-used kitchen tools.</p><h2>Reading app</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b7d91110-5db6-11ec-bef5-ab966a0e7fcb" alt="Scribd" data-uuid="7fcef73a-f2b8-3505-9ba3-b18a425b1f55"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Scribd</div></figure><p>Don’t take your habit of doom-scrolling on Twitter for hours every day into the new year.

Powered by Overdrive, it connects you with your local library’s digital collection, allowing you to borrow and download all kinds of e-books, audiobooks, magazines, graphic novels and more. Libby also has a tag system that you can use to “save” titles for later without actually putting a hold on them (although you can do that in the app, too). If you find a bunch of audiobooks you eventually want to get to, you can give them all a “TBR” tag so you can quickly find them and borrow one when you need new reading/listening material.</p><p>As someone who uses Libby on a regular basis, I love how easy it is to borrow from my local library without leaving my home. However, there have been numerous times in which my library doesn’t have a title I’m looking for. If that happens to you often, you may want to consider a subscription service like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kindle Unlimited" href="https://amzn.to/3357xrD">Kindle Unlimited</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Scribd" href="https://fave.co/3dpVDdH">Scribd</a>, both of which give you unlimited access to a wide library of e-books for $10 per month. And for audiobook lovers, your options are Amazon’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Audible" href="https://amzn.to/3y21M9G">Audible</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Libro.fm" href="https://fave.co/3BDeg8m">Libro.fm</a>, the latter of which lets you choose the local bookstore you want to support with your purchases.</p><h2>E-reader</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/629b3dd0-35d5-11ec-9ffb-68a8f5cf7272" alt="Amazon&#39;s latest Kindle Paperwhite e-reader, which was released at the end of October 2021." data-uuid="5d6b88d4-7629-3d21-847b-584e9b44c1fa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>E-readers are still around because so many people recognize how much better it can be to read e-books on a dedicated device — especially one with an e-paper display.

An e-reader like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon&#x002019;s Kindle Paperwhite" href="https://amzn.to/3y74Xgg">Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kobo&#x002019;s Clara HD" href="https://fave.co/2ZXcVM8">Kobo’s Clara HD</a> is a better choice not only for its more comfortable display, but also because it focuses your attention on reading. (If you’ve ever picked up your smartphone intending to finish a chapter only to be distracted by email or Twitter, you know how crucial this is.)</p><p>The new Kindle Paperwhite has a 6.8-inch display with adjustable warm lights, 20 percent faster page turns and weeks of battery life. The Clara HD is similar, with a 6-inch E-Ink display, adjustable brightness and color temperature, along with weeks of battery life. If you already get most of your e-books through Amazon, the Paperwhite is the best option. You can listen to Audible audiobooks, too, if you connect a pair of wireless earbuds to the e-reader. Kobo’s device primarily gets books via the Kobo Store, but it also supports various file types like EPUB, PDF and MOBI. Plus, it has on-device integration with Overdrive, allowing you to borrow library books directly from the e-reader.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tech-to-help-you-stick-to-new-years-resolutions-150034002.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d268cac0-7edc-3db7-9652-0f5053b214ba</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 14:34:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641047694</ingested><modified>2022-01-01T14:35:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[news]]></category><category><![CDATA[Organization]]></category><category><![CDATA[AppleWatch]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[skillshare]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audible]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[todoapp]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitbit]]></category><category><![CDATA[instantpot]]></category><category><![CDATA[Masterclass]]></category><category><![CDATA[habittracker]]></category><category><![CDATA[paprika]]></category><category><![CDATA[NewYear]]></category><category><![CDATA[productivity]]></category><category><![CDATA[newyear'sresolution]]></category><category><![CDATA[Passwordmanager]]></category><category><![CDATA[kindle]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d7db5700-3e1a-11eb-b2f8-45107f303171" width="7562" height="5044" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d7db5700-3e1a-11eb-b2f8-45107f303171" width="7562" height="5044" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[luza studios via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A red yoga mat on white hardwood floor in a domestic living room at home.

There have been some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/accessibility-in-tech-2020-150002855.html"><ins>improvements</ins></a>, including video call apps like FaceTime, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Hangouts and more adding better support for sign language interpreters and closed captioning. And, this year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-stories-captions-172051963.html"><ins>Instagram</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-automatic-captions-120049862.html"><ins>TikTok</ins></a> finally added stickers that enable automated captioning for speech in videos, too. But major organizations continued to make decisions that exclude people with disabilities. The organizer of E3 2021, for example, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/e3-2021-closed-captions-fail-224552954.html"><ins>failed its deaf and hard of hearing viewers</ins></a> during its live streamed show.</p><p>There are too many individual transgressions and improvements to exhaustively detail here. Due to their sheer size, though, tech’s largest companies wield the greatest influence over what the rest of the industry does. By holding them accountable, we have a better chance of seeing widespread change in the way tech thinks about inclusive design. Here’s how Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta (formerly Facebook) and more did to improve the accessibility of their products and services in 2021.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><section data-eng-breakout="ab74f97dc0eb48a197650d6d686b274b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/25c681c0-1cfe-11ec-b1ed-aff3c2fd2c38" alt="A blue iPhone 13 Pro Max and a starlight gold iPhone 13 Pro standing with their backs facing the camera." data-uuid="3352817d-2823-392b-b212-88cc85993a7c"></section><h3>Apple</h3><p>Apple has led the way in inclusive design for years, and in 2021 the company continued to launch new features that made its products easier for those with disabilities to use. In addition to updating its screen reader, VoiceOver, to enable better descriptions of images for the visually impaired, Apple also launched several new products. In May, it rolled out a service called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-sign-time-brings-up-a-sign-language-translator-on-demand-172828126.html"><ins>SignTime</ins></a>, which allowed customers to engage sign language interpreters on demand when communicating with customer service representatives (via their browsers at least). The feature is available in the US, UK and France and supports American, British or French sign languages in their respective countries.</p><p>Apple also introduced Assistive Touch for the Watch this year, allowing for touch-free interaction with its wearable. The idea is that users can clench their fists or pinch their fingers together to navigate the smartwatch. In practice, Assistive Touch took some learning, and it still may not be feasible for those who don’t have the dexterity or strength to clench their fists to trigger the “double clench” action. But it’s a start, and one that few other smartwatches offer.</p><p>For those with very limited range of motion, this year also saw the launch of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/td-pilot-ipad-eye-tracking-tobii-dynavox-140046055.html"><ins>first medically certified eye-controlled iPad</ins></a> by Tobii Dynavox. Called the TD Pilot, it’s a case for iPads as large as the 12.9-inch Pro model and comes with Tobii’s powerful eye-tracking sensor, large speakers, additional batteries and a wheelchair mount. Together with iPadOS 15, this will allow those with cerebral palsy, for example, to interact not only with the tablet, but also communicate with others more easily. A window on the other side of the case can display words to show what the user is saying.</p><div id="7e189c57ff32487ab958f95214c55a35"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfZ0ntD4grQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Apple also added improvements for hearing aid users with iPhones this year, allowing for bi-directional communication. This means that those who connect compatible hearing aids to their iPhones no longer have to use their handset’s mic to be heard by their callers — the hearing aid can pick up the speaker’s voice, too. So far, Starkey and ReSound have released compatible “made for iPhone” devices.</p><p>On macOS, Apple also made it possible to customize the outline and fill color of the cursor so those with visual impairments can more easily tell when the mouse moves or changes shape. The company also expanded its keyboard shortcuts to allow users to control everything on a Mac with a keyboard (no need for a mouse or trackpad).</p><p>Finally, Apple added tools for developers using SwiftUI to make their apps more accessible. With this simplified workflow, there are now fewer obstacles in the way when trying to make more inclusive products.</p><p>Unfortunately, when Apple released iOS 15, it removed some features from Siri that were “used by many individuals for accessibility purposes,” according to Clark Rachfal. He’s the director of advocacy and governmental affairs for the American Council of the Blind. Rachfal told Engadget that users “could no longer access their calling history, voicemails, emails and messages through Siri” when the OS was updated. The council and its members alerted Apple of these issues, he said, adding that the company said it’s working on “restoring this functionality to Siri.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="551648cb41774f2694b0bac6a997def5" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/267f31c0-3518-11ec-b77a-eaedc4ec3ccf" alt="Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro." data-uuid="40874fff-6e5e-39d8-ac75-cb8c8e620fa2"></section><h3>Google</h3><p>Google continued to add tools for people with disabilities <a href="https://www.google.com/accessibility/"><ins>across its broad portfolio of products and services</ins></a> in 2021. One highlight was the launch of Project Relate, an Android app that would generate custom voice recognition models for people with severe speech impairments. Then, the app can transcribe, display and read out what the user said. Project Relate is currently in beta, with Google inviting those with atypical speech to sign up as testers.</p><p>The company did plenty to improve its existing products, too. In <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/all-new-talkback/"><ins>February</ins></a>, it revamped its Talkback screen reader to offer new gestures and voice commands. In March, it <a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/live-caption-chrome/"><ins>announced </ins></a>that the Chrome browser could transcribe audio from the web for users who are deaf or hard of hearing. That transcription would be performed on-device, meaning you could get your captions without worrying about connecting to the cloud.</p><p>Later in the year, Google also added 10 languages to its auto-generated image descriptions tool, brought <a href="https://blog.google/products/chromebooks/accessibility-features/"><ins>more natural-sounding voices</ins></a> to the “Select to speak” feature in Chromebooks and made it easier to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-accessibility-camera-switch-project-activate-160013117.html"><ins>interact with Android devices using facial expressions</ins></a>.</p><div id="7a15c7850ab947789a9028c371cf1174"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CSLv-dhVKxs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In addition to improving its existing products, Google also explored accessible experiences that could produce learnings for the industry at large. It teamed up with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and <em>The Guardian</em> on <a href="https://auditorial.withgoogle.com/?utm_source=gblog"><ins>Auditorial</ins></a>, which it describes as an experiment in storytelling that “adapts to suit the reader.” It’s a fully customizable experience that Google said will “offer those with visual disabilities an experience that is as comfortable, rich and creative as any other reader.”</p><p>According to the company, Auditorial “is intended to pose a question about how much more accessible the world’s information could be, if you could simply tailor every website to suit your personal sensory needs and preferences.” The hope is that this triggers a discussion on how the web could become more inclusive instead of “a one-size-fits-all approach.” Google published its findings in an “Auditorial Accessibility Notebook,” in order to help other publishers learn tips on how to “open up online storytelling to millions of blind and low vision users.”</p><p>Google also launched a browser-based game this year called SignTown, which uses your camera to teach you sign language and assess your progress. The game is just “one component of a broader effort to push the boundaries of technology for sign language and Deaf culture.” The company said it’s also exploring building “a more comprehensive dictionary across more sign and written languages, as well as collaborating with the Google Search team on surfacing these results to improve search quality for sign languages.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="83b5237498e34cadad6478132da4a55f" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5f8be630-6a73-11ec-be4b-53b887109c97" alt="Microsoft Surface Adaptive Kit packaging and label." data-uuid="f9061fea-7bdc-3a27-b565-090e61db8024"></section><p></p><h3>Microsoft</h3><p>In 2021, Microsoft surprised us by releasing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html"><ins>Windows 11</ins></a>, which it <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/10/04/making-windows-11-the-most-inclusively-designed-version-of-windows-yet/"><ins>called</ins></a> the “most inclusively designed version of Windows yet.” The new OS brings nicer-looking dark and high contrast themes, plus updated sounds that are more soothing and can be heard by more users. The company also renamed its “Ease of Access” section to “Accessibility” to make assistive tools easier to find. Windows Voice Typing also makes it easier to dictate your messages.</p><p>Prior to launching Windows 11, though, Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/04/28/doubling-down-on-accessibility-microsofts-next-steps-to-expand-accessibility-in-technology-the-workforce-and-workplace/"><ins>announced</ins></a> a five-year commitment to “help bridge the ‘Disability Divide’.” It focuses on hiring and educating people with disabilities, as well as building more accessible products. That includes using AI in Word to detect and convert heading styles for blind and low-vision readers, a <a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/see-the-big-picture-with-navigation-pane-for-excel"><ins>new navigation pane in Excel</ins></a> for screen readers and expanding Immersive Reader to better convey what’s on PowerPoint slides and notes. It added a new accessibility checker that works in the background and prompts users to fix issues across Microsoft Office <a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/accessibility-ribbon-in-powerpoint-accessibility-made-easier"><ins>apps</ins></a> and <a href="https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/sending-accessible-emails-in-outlook-for-windows"><ins>Outlook</ins></a>.</p><p>The company not only expanded live captioning and transcription capabilities in Teams, but  also rolled out support for CART (Communication Access Realtime Translation) captions, as well as the ability to pin and spotlight multiple presenters. Auto-captioning is also available for LinkedIn Live broadcasts.</p><div id="3e43cf4d41584652a6a762ed7d5eabba"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yb63YJe_Vyg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>To make its hardware easier to use, the company launched a new Surface Adaptive Kit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-adaptive-kit-accessibility-160002034.html"><ins>in September</ins></a>. The bundle includes tags, labels, keycaps and more to make PC parts and important buttons more identifiable. Like Apple, Microsoft also added sign language support (specifically ASL) to its Stores to assist deaf shoppers. Unlike Apple, however, Microsoft doesn’t appear to offer this for after-sales support yet.</p><p>Microsoft is one of few companies in tech that’s transparent about its efforts to improve training and hiring processes for people with disabilities. It made investments via its Urban Airband initiative “to provide affordable broadband, hardware and software to people with disabilities starting in Los Angeles and New York.” Following a pilot at the University of Illinois, Microsoft said it’s expanding to additional tertiary education institutes to “increase graduation rates of students with disabilities in STEM education.” It’s also working to “create best-in-class Universal Design Learning (UDL) environments in STEM education.”</p><p>To connect people with disabilities to employers, Microsoft announced that it’s adding new accessibility resources and features to LinkedIn, including a LinkedIn Learning course focusing on “accessibility in the modern workplace.” There were also LinkedIn Coaches events specifically aiming to help job seekers with disabilities find employment opportunities. The company also partnered with <a href="https://www.bemyeyes.com/"><ins>Be My Eyes</ins></a>, an app that connects blind and low vision users with sighted volunteers, to make LinkedIn staff available for visual assistance on video calls.</p><p>Microsoft also launched an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-accessibility"><ins>AI for Accessibility</ins></a><a href="https://sway.office.com/eifyflyGQXin1GIt"><ins>Low-Cost Assistive Technology Fund</ins></a> to make assistive technology reachable to those who can’t afford it. Considering how expensive assistive technology currently is, this is a promising step towards getting people the gear they need. Though it’s still limited in its reach, the Fund is at least an acknowledgement of the high price that people with disabilities continue to have to pay to be part of the world able-bodied people take for granted.</p><section data-eng-breakout="098ad44f646a4ccb84ab35ea5e19cdab" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/041728e0-6a74-11ec-b3e9-ea8c5711f13d" alt="UNSPECIFIED - SEPTEMBER 28: In this screengrab, Amazon Astro is introduced during Amazon Devices and Services Announcement on September 28, 2021.

The company says it pays attention to aging individuals and helping them feel more confident living independently. This year, it introduced two programs as part of its Alexa Smart Properties service that enable administrators to offer voice-assisted experiences in places like senior living facilities and hospitals. The company also launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-together-service-171909617.html"><ins>Alexa Together</ins></a> to keep caregivers and elderly individuals connected via an Alexa-enabled device. It would offer features like fall detection and remote assist to give loved ones peace of mind.</p><p>Amazon also updated the Alexa app to offer light and dark modes, as well as text scaling. It rolled out a new option to give people more time to finish speaking before Alexa gives a response, which it said is designed to help people with certain speech impediments. The company also included cards with braille text in the boxes for the Echo Frames 2nd gen, guiding users to a website with screen-reader-friendly setup instructions. On the Kindle app for iOS, Amazon launched a dictionary audio feature to read out individual selected words and help those with learning disabilities or foreign language speakers better understand pronunciations.</p><p>This year, the company introduced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html"><ins>new home robot called Astro</ins></a> that follows you around your home and provides easy access to helpful info via its display. It works with Alexa Together to help caregivers look out for loved ones remotely and keeps an eye on your home while you’re away. The robot features similar accessibility features to the Echo Show smart displays and has been trained “to work for customers who use wheelchairs, walkers or canes.” It will also play specialized driving sounds to stop it becoming a tripping hazard.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2fbf9cc0-6a74-11ec-93ae-39611dfa5635" style="height:1024;width:1920;" alt="A Cognixion headset on a white mannequin head." data-uuid="15f3d53e-d3b2-3035-9b58-6a3ded5089c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cognixion</div></figure><p>Amazon also invests in several accessibility-minded projects through its Alexa Fund, including Labrador Systems, which makes home robots to help people with limited mobility live more independently. The company has also worked with neural interface startup Cognixion to <a href="https://www.cognixion.com/blog/2021/11/16/cognixion-raises-12-million-to-advance-assisted-reality-tech-for-millions-affected-by-communication-disabilities"><ins>add Alexa support to its brain-computer interface headsets</ins></a> for easier smart home device control.

According to Rachfal, though Prime TV offers audio descriptions on a large amount of content, many titles use text to speech with synthetic voices. Rachfal added that these “lack the quality of human narrated audio description and the overall quality of the content suffers, making it less enjoyable for blind and low vision consumers.”</p><p>To Rachfal, this is an example of something that’s done for people with disabilities “without input, feedback and collaboration with the disability community.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="4cc7b27f5e1248919413ba82a7600844" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6bfafb50-3b47-11ec-8bed-bf2e27c6e69c" alt="A sign of Meta, the new name for the company formerly known as Facebook, is seen at its headquarters in Menlo Park, California, U.S. October 28, 2021.

At the start of 2021, the company updated its Automatic Alt Text (AAT) system to recognize over 1,200 objects and concepts in photos on Instagram and Facebook. According to Meta, this represented a 10x increase since AAT’s debut in 2016. It also rolled out additional features to Facebook on iOS that provided more detailed descriptions like positions of objects in a picture and their relative sizes.</p><p>Unfortunately, as it pushed out these updates, Facebook may have broken some accessibility features along the way. Rachfal said that when the company turned off its facial recognition system this year, it led to less-informative descriptions for users who are blind or have low-vision. Rachfal said this change “was done due to privacy concerns,” and he believes these decisions were made without considering accessibility and the disability community. “Nor were they given the same weight and consideration as privacy concerns,” Rachfal added.</p><p>Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/"><ins>published a post addressing this issue</ins></a> in November. In it, the company’s vice president of artificial intelligence Jerome Pesenti wrote, “We need to weigh the positive use cases for facial recognition against growing societal concerns, especially as regulators have yet to provide clear rules.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ba2ee9b0-6a74-11ec-b3f6-aa7d829fbf7c" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="A banner showing an example of Automatic Alternative Text on Instagram, with a green box around a picture and words saying " data-uuid="c983f3a2-c769-304d-805b-3512ad452dc6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>In the post, Pesenti acknowledges the critical role face recognition plays in AAT to help blind and low-vision users identify their friends in pictures. But while some facial recognition tools, like identity verification, will remain, for the most part features like alerting users to photos potentially including them or automatically labeling their friends are going away. That’s for both sighted and visually impaired users.</p><p>“We know the approach we’ve chosen involves some difficult tradeoffs,” Pesenti wrote, adding that “we will continue engaging in that conversation and working with the civil society groups and regulators who are leading this discussion.”</p><p>Elsewhere in Meta’s family of products, the company added an Accessibility tab to the Oculus Settings menu to make assistive features easier to find. It also brought Color Correction and Raise View tools to offer more legible palettes and enable a standing perspective for seated users respectively. Meta said it’s still iterating on Raise View, working with the Oculus community to improve the feature and will permanently add it to the Accessibility menu when ready.</p><p>Meta also collaborated with ZP Better Together, a company that makes technology for deaf and hard-of-hearing users, to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-portal-video-relay-services-for-deaf-153223465.html"><ins>bring sign language interpreters into video calls</ins></a> on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-portals-go-170004952.html"><ins>Portal devices</ins></a>. As of December, people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing can also apply on ZP’s website to get free Portals which will come with the ZP apps.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fe6427d0-6a74-11ec-9575-0d4c265cd3bb" style="height:3319;width:5900;" alt="New models of Facebook&#39;s Portal video-calling devices are pictured in this undated handout image obtained by Reuters.

It also included a visual cue to indicate who’s speaking, and offers captions for other audio products like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/molly-burke-facebook-video"><ins>Soundbites</ins></a> and Podcasts on iOS and Android.</p><p>Let’s not forget the company’s renaming to Meta this year and its new focus on the metaverse. According to head of accessibility Mike Shebanek, “we&#39;re already working to bring the metaverse to life and are excited to explore the breakthrough possibilities it presents to make the digital world even more accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities.”</p><p>We’ll have to wait and see if and how that comes true, but in the meantime, Meta must continue to engage with the accessibility community to make sure that its expansion of the metaverse is inclusive from the start.</p><p></p><h3>Twitter</h3><p>Twitter only set up its two accessibility teams last year, after an embarrassing launch of Voice Tweets that excluded its deaf and hard of hearing users due to a lack of captions. Since then, though, the company has shown noteworthy improvement. In 2021, Twitter introduced captions for voice tweets, added captions and accessibility labels in Spaces and brought automatic video captions. That last one is “available globally in most languages,” according to the company and supported on Android, iOS and the web.</p><div id="27fd0f5bf03a4da4b42e4115c848e378"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A couple months ago we rolled out video caption file upload. Starting today, all videos will be auto-captioned. <br><br>To see them, turn on captioning in your mobile device settings, or select the CC button on Web. <br><br>What do you think of the experience? <a href="https://t.co/fywdjC6yDI">https://t.co/fywdjC6yDI</a></p>— Twitter Accessibility (@TwitterA11y) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterA11y/status/1470870652215345165?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 14, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Though this may seem like a small set of updates compared to the rest of the companies in this roundup, Twitter also has a smaller portfolio of products. Still, it has managed to make significant changes. Rachfal praised Twitter as being “the first social media platform to conspicuously prompt users to include alt text with images,” though he did note that filling out the field is still optional.</p><h3>Other noteworthy developments in tech this year</h3><p>Alt text and captioning continue to be tricky accessibility features for the industry. They’re labor-intensive processes that companies tend to delegate to AI, which can result in garbled, inaccurate results. This was especially evident at this year’s virtual E3 gaming convention, where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/e3-2021-closed-captions-fail-224552954.html"><ins>illegible closed captions</ins></a> sometimes made the show incomprehensible for those who relied on subtitles to understand the announcements.</p><p>There are also large parts of the online world that are in dire need of accessibility-related upgrades. According to a February 2021 study by <a href="https://webaim.org/projects/million/"><ins>WebAIM (Web Accessibility In Mind)</ins></a>, for example, a whopping 97.4 percent of websites had mistakes that failed the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<a href="https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist"><ins>WCAG 2</ins></a>). The most common errors included missing alt text, low contrast text, missing form input labels and more.</p><p>It’s not just websites that need work: Other media formats also need to be more inclusively designed. The National Association of the Deaf (NAD), for example, <a href="https://www.nad.org/2021/12/14/lawsuit-challenges-inaccessibility-of-major-podcast-platforms/"><ins>filed a lawsuit</ins></a> with Disability Rights Advocates (DRA) this year against three major podcast providers: SiriusXM, Stitcher and Pandora.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b6b3d740-6a75-11ec-bdab-9abd5ec27cea" style="height:329;width:675;" alt="A banner showing three Spotify screenshots with an example of a transcript on the left." data-uuid="e92a301f-586a-3acd-95d7-7828509055c9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Spotify</div></figure><p>According to the NAD, because the three defendants “do not make transcripts or captions available for any of the podcasts offered on their platforms, more than 48 million deaf and hard of hearing Americans are denied full and equal enjoyment of the content they offer their hearing users.” Meanwhile, Spotify <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-automatically-transcribe-podcasts-accessbility-mobile-165029865.html"><ins>announced this year</ins></a> that it will start offering automatically generated transcripts for podcasts, and Amazon Music <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-music-synchronized-podcast-transcripts-160548838.html"><ins>launched synchronized transcripts</ins></a> in November.</p><p>Then there are entire industries that could use accessibility improvements. Rachfal notes that healthcare is a continually problematic area for people who are blind or have visual impairments. “This is still an entire sector that we hear about far too often from our members,” he said. Given that we are currently in the mires of the third wave of COVID-19, it’s inexcusable to continue excluding people with disabilities when it comes to things like scheduling vaccination or testing appointments.</p><p>In November this year, the Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-agreement-rite-aid-corporation-make-its-online-covid-19-vaccine"><ins>announced</ins></a> it had reached a settlement with Rite Aid to make COVID-19 testing and vaccination websites accessible. Rite Aid’s vaccine registration portal was not compatible with some screen readers and was not accessible to “those who have a hard time using a mouse.” The calendar on its website, for example, “did not show screen reader users any available appointment times,” while people relying on keyboard-based navigation instead of a mouse could not use the tab key to complete a consent form required to schedule an appointment.</p><p>The ACB also worked with CVS to offer accessible prescription information in all locations in the country. This includes a <a href="https://cvshealth.com/news-and-insights/press-releases/spoken-rx-talking-prescription-labels-now-available-in-all-cvs">Spoken RX feature</a> that would read out prescription labels via the CVS Pharmacy app.</p><p>Though there have been many transgressions in the past year, we also saw many promising developments in ensuring technology is inclusive. The FCC, for example, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-emergency-alert-system-deaf-accessibility-171239252.html"><ins>proposed rules in December</ins></a> to make emergency alerts more useful and informative for people who are deaf or hard of hearing.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1f746650-6a76-11ec-b0d6-667e2c7cb6fa" style="height:1816;width:3360;" alt="A TV monitor showing the new Emergency Alert System(EAS) test is seen on November 9, 2011 in Washington, DC. The FCC and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, conducted the first-ever nationwide test of the national Emergency Alert System. EAS participants broadcast alerts and warnings regarding severe weather alerts, child abductions and other types of emergencies. The EAS alerts are transmitted over radio and television broadcast stations, cable television and other media services.

Also, in collaboration with the Coalition for Inclusive Fitness, Planet Fitness <a href="https://www.acb.org/planet-fitness"><ins>said</ins></a> it will buy and install accessible exercise equipment in its stores across the country.</p><p>I’ve only scratched the surface in this roundup of updates. What’s most encouraging, though, is the increasing willingness of companies to work with disability rights groups and advocates at the earliest stages of product design. Lizzie Sorkin, director of engagement for the NAD, said it’s “seeing more and more companies reach out to us in the beginning phases for input rather than late in the process.” Rachfal also noted a “growing commitment to accessible media and content” that’s “born out of the advocacy work of ACB and the Audio description Project through collaborative discussions with industry.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/accessibility-in-tech-2021-report-card-apple-google-microsoft-amazon-facebook-meta-twitter-210034415.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b559da73-3d56-4866-9713-525fe97b54a5</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 31 Dec 2021 21:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640983397</ingested><modified>2021-12-31T20:43:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Physical Disabilities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a24ccc70-6a76-11ec-9bff-cffdaad37b87" width="4364" height="2933" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a24ccc70-6a76-11ec-9bff-cffdaad37b87" width="4364" height="2933" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brian Lawless - PA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[IrelandÕs first socially assistive AI robot 'Stevie II' from robotics engineers at Trinity College Dublin, with Brendan Crean, who helped trial the robot through the charity ALONE, during a special demonstration at the Science Gallery in Dublin.
