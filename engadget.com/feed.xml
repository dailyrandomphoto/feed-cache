Middling hardware and consistently buggy software held back what could have been a compelling experience. But with the Surface Duo 2, the company wants to change all that with a device that focuses on addressing the shortcomings of its predecessor.&nbsp;</p><p>Take one look at the Surface Duo 2, and you’ll notice it has a substantial camera bump. That might not seem like much of an upgrade, but it is because it means the Surface Duo 2 comes with a far more capable and versatile camera system than its predecessor. The original featured a single 11-megapixel above its right display. That meant you had to use that one camera for both selfies and regular shots. Add some imprecise software for switching between camera modes, and the Surface Duo was never great at capturing snapshots.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the addition of three new cameras, the Surface Duo 2 should at the very least allow you to capture a greater variety of shots. The triple rear camera array consists of a 12-megapixel wide-angle, a 12-megapixel telephoto and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide. The primary and telephoto cameras feature f/1.7 and f/2.4 aperture lenses, phase detection autofocus and optical image stabilization.</p><p>Less noticeable but welcome all the same are the tweaks Microsoft has made to Duo’s signature dual PixelSense displays. The new model features slightly larger 5.8-inch AMOLED screens that combine into a single 8.3-inch display. They’re also brighter and feature a variable refresh rate of up to 90Hz for smoother scrolling.</p><p>Other notable features include a new sound system Microsoft says delivers stereo sound no matter how you hold or position the Surface Duo 2. On the side of the device, you’ll find a nifty ambient display that shows things like how much battery life you have. Oh, there’s also a new Obsidian black that is quite fetching, and you can attach a Surface Pen magnetically to the device.</p><p><em>Developing...</em></p><p><em>Follow all of the news from </em>Microsoft&#39;s<em> fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-annoucement-152736648.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a93d8aa-a600-4fcd-801a-209d8a2ef1d9</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:27:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632324745</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T15:32:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dff26ff0-1bb9-11ec-a9bb-abd3b7047d37" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dff26ff0-1bb9-11ec-a9bb-abd3b7047d37" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jon Turi / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Surface Duo 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Surface Duo 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Surface Adaptive Kit makes Microsoft's laptops more accessible]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We all know what to expect with new laptops: Upgraded chips, often thinner designs, and whiz-bang new features. But it&#39;s easy to ignore how some of those changes can affect people with disabilities. Making a notebook thinner can <em>also</em> make it harder to open, for example. So to better equip its PCs to be more accessible, Microsoft created the Surface Adaptive Kit, a collection of add-ons that can help you find specific keys, locate ports and flip open your PC or kickstand.</p><p>While they may just look like a collection of simple stickers, it still shows that Microsoft is actually thinking of people with disabilities. The Adaptive Kit comes from its Inclusive Tech Lab, the same folks behind the revolutionary <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-17-xbox-adaptive-controller-disabilities-gamepad-microsoft-tour.html">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a>. The impetus for the Surface kit is also very similar: It&#39;s all about making Microsoft&#39;s hardware easier for everyone to use.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the box, you&#39;ll find a set of translucent keycap labels to highlight keys you use often, a set of three-dimensional bump labels for ports and buttons, and raised port indicators with matching cable wrap. To give you more leverage with cases and kickstands, there&#39;s also a ring opener and pull-tab opener.&nbsp;</p><p>The company isn&#39;t saying how much the Surface Adaptive Kit will cost when it arrives later this year, but hopefully it&#39;ll come in relatively cheap. After all, an accessibility-focused product should work for all budgets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Microsoft&#39;s fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-adaptive-kit-accessibility-160002034.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">defb3b6e-e2eb-43c3-b61a-5da3e726d2ea</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:23:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632324215</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T15:23:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f04774f0-1bb8-11ec-bffb-a22b99dcbef3" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f04774f0-1bb8-11ec-bffb-a22b99dcbef3" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Adaptive Kit]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Adaptive Kit]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft's Surface Pro X will start at $899 with Windows 11 refresh]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Microsoft introduced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-price-specs-availability-windows-arm-lte.html"><ins>Surface Pro X</ins></a> in 2019, it promised the start of something new for the company’s 2-in-1 line.

The university&#39;s Science and and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/csail">CSAIL</a>) created the kit using something called &quot;electrical impedance tomography&quot; (EIT), that measures internal conductivity to gauge whether muscles are activated or relaxed. The research could allow for wearables that monitor distracted driving, hand gestures or muscle movements for physical rehabilitation.&nbsp;</p><p>In a paper, the researchers wrote that EIT sensing usually requires expensive hardware setups and complex algorithms to decipher the data. The advent of 3D printing, inexpensive electronics and open-source EIT image libraries has made it feasible for more users, but designing a wearable setup is still a challenge.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="741ad4aa124b4a4fb2cebb6963e1f4f2"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gIi0xiMexYU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>To that end, the &quot;EIT-kit&quot; 3D editor allows users to enter the device parameters and place the sensors on a device that may go on a user&#39;s wrist or leg, for instance. It can then be exported to a 3D printer and assembled, and the final step is to calibrate the device using a subject. For that, it&#39;s connected to the EIT-kit&#39;s sensing mother board, and &quot;an on-board microcontroller library automates the electrical impedance measurement and lets you see the visual measured data, even on a mobile phone,&quot; according to CSAIL.</p><p>Where most wearables can only sense motion, and EIT device can sense actual muscle activity. The team built one prototype that could sense muscle strain and tension in a subject&#39;s thigh, allowing them to monitor muscle recovery after an injury. It also showed other possible uses, like gesture recognition, a distracted driving detector and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The team is working with Massachusetts General Hospital on rehabilitation tech using the devices while refining the tech. The eventual aim is to develop &quot;rapid function prototyping techniques and novel sensing technologies,&quot; said lead author Junyi Zhu.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-toolkit-allows-you-to-design-your-own-health-monitoring-wearables-130010870.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a7f106c-a054-4009-9f63-fcfe0c3ac7c6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632318255</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T13:44:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2d94e2b0-1b92-11ec-af7f-b825e34bec91" width="1600" height="687" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2d94e2b0-1b92-11ec-af7f-b825e34bec91" width="1600" height="687" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT/CSAILs]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIT's toolkit allows you to design your own health monitoring wearables]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MIT's toolkit allows you to design your own health monitoring wearables]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPad mini review (2021): The best small tablet gets a facelift]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="f30705edd63d4e839870bd1ba5f03418"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MJAQPqh3DeM" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>It’s almost comical how stagnant the iPad mini has been in recent years. The 2019 version sported an upgraded processor and a slightly nicer display, but essentially looked the same as the tablet that debuted in 2012 (which is dated, to say the least). That hasn’t stopped the iPad mini from gaining a loyal following though, and we even called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-29-apple-ipad-mini-review-2019.html">2019’s mini</a> our favorite small tablet.</p><p>Now it appears that Apple’s giving the tablet the love that its devotees have been asking for. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:6th-generation iPad mini" href="https://amzn.to/3tXuQwY">6th-generation iPad mini</a> is really more of an iPad-Air mini with its new “all-screen” Liquid Retina design, TouchID-capable top button, second-generation Apple Pencil support and USB-C charging. It’s the most significant update the mini has received in years, and Apple’s hoping you’ll pay extra for it. The 2021 iPad mini starts at $499, $100 more than its predecessor’s starting price, and with that Apple is squashing any notions that “smaller” means “lesser.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design and hardware</h2><p>Many people, myself included, were happy to see the facelift Apple gave the iPad mini. While the old design with the physical Home button isn’t necessarily bad (it’s still good enough for the new 10.2-inch iPad, apparently), it felt boring on the mini after seeing it unchanged for so many years. This year’s iPad mini has what Apple calls an “all-screen” design, which is just different enough from the “edge-to-edge” display that the iPad Pros have to warrant discussion.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="e4f7be3d-d63a-4f67-9484-f4ac28054fee"/><p>I understand why Apple didn’t want to give the mini the same “edge-to-edge” moniker, but it could have come up with something a bit better than “all-screen.” The bezel surrounding the 11-inch iPad Pro’s screen is roughly 0.25-inches thick and that of the iPad mini is only about 1/8th of an inch thicker than that. That’s not a huge difference, but it’s more noticeable when you’re only working with an 8.3-inch display. Also, the previous iPad mini had a 7.9-inch display, so you’re not getting a ton of extra screen real estate on the new model.</p><p>That said, I found the bezels to be just the right size. Notably, they helped me get a better grip on the mini when I was using it as an e-reader, and I can only assume many mini owners will do the same. The same could be said for when I was watching YouTube videos while carrying the mini around my apartment — I never accidentally paused the playing video because the bezels gave me enough room to hold the device.</p><p>The new mini’s display size and the fact that it’s a Liquid Retina panel are the upgrades here, because the 5th-gen model supported TrueTone, 500 nits of brightness and the P3 color range as well. This year’s mini has a 2266 x 1488 resolution, 326ppi panel, which is only slightly higher than the old model’s 2048 x 1536 resolution, 326ppi screen. If you upgrade from the 2019 mini, you may not notice a huge difference in quality, but the rounded-rectangle shape of the new mini’s display and the revamped design overall gives it a fresh feel.</p><p>Otherwise, I felt like I had a small version of the iPad Air the entire time I was using the mini. Their designs are very similar, save for the location of certain buttons. The iPad mini now has flat edges with a TouchID-capable power button and volume adjusters at the top and a USB-C port at the bottom. Notably, its edges lack a headphone jack and that may be a key factor for current iPad mini owners in their decision to upgrade or not. It’s made of 100-percent recycled aluminum, weighs less than one pound and measures 6.3mm thick — just as portable as the last model, but with a much-needed modern aesthetic.</p><p>TouchID is nothing different from older iOS devices, although it may take you a tad longer to set up because of how narrow the fingerprint-sensitive button is. It’s exciting that Apple finally brought USB-C to yet another iPad as it makes charging more efficient but it also continues to feed us poor saps who yearn for a USB-C iPhone sometime in our lifetimes. Also, the new design allows the second-generation Apple Pencil to neatly and magnetically stick to the right edge of the tablet.</p><h2>In use</h2><p>I’ve been keeping the iPad mini by my side at all times for the past week or so, and I was pleasantly surprised by how easy that was thanks to its size. Every iPad is portable, but some are certainly more portable than others. I have a 2020 11-inch iPad Pro and, while it could come with me almost anywhere, I mostly use it in my home as a secondary device or as my main driver when I’m traveling. The iPad mini, on the other hand, could fit into almost any bag I own without hassle, providing a much-needed larger screen for activities like reading, watching videos and FaceTime calls. I didn’t find it super difficult to use my thumbs to type on the mini, treating it almost like a super-wide iPhone, but I also wouldn’t call it a comfortable experience.</p><section data-eng-breakout="aeceff1e36a84ba194db4a2d654063b5" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/703d1740-1ad9-11ec-87fd-a14d268b7118" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="c2a3a301-d3b4-3c9a-9a8a-9c012a14e273"></section><p>Speaking of FaceTime, the iPad mini comes equipped with the new 12MP ultra wide front camera that supports Center Stage, the feature that automatically pans and zooms to keep you in frame during video calls. Each time I used FaceTime, I could move around my (admittedly small) kitchen and the mini’s camera followed me so my family could always see most of my face. There’s a limit, of course — I often stepped out of the camera’s field of view, but it followed me until I was nearly out of the camera’s field of view. This is a handy feature for anyone like me who’s often multitasking while catching up with loved ones over FaceTime.</p><p>The rear camera is also better than that on the previous mini, but I wouldn’t consider it a huge selling point. It’s a 12MP wide camera with an f/1.8 aperture, 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED TrueTone flash and Smart HDR 3 support. It can also shoot 4K 60 fps videos and shoot Slo-Mo videos at up to 1080p 240 fps. We’ve all seen a tablet photographer in the wild, but considering the shooters on our phones are far-and-away more capable than those on tablets, most people turn to the smallest screen in their pockets for photography. The pictures of my fiancé and my cat that I took with the mini were just fine, but I found myself more inclined to use the rear camera as a document scanner with Evernote’s Scannable app. And even in that case, was it better than using my iPhone? Not necessarily, just more convenient when I was using the iPad mini as my default device.</p><p>I may not have been taking a ton of photos with the iPad mini, but I use it for almost everything else that I normally turned to my iPhone for. The A15 Bionic chip inside makes the mini feel zippy, and it handled everything that I threw at it well. I spent most of the time watching YouTube and Netflix videos, answering messages in Gmail and Slack, taking notes in Evernote, saving wedding inspo in Pinterest, browsing e-cookbooks in the Kindle app and doodling in Procreate and GoodNotes. The iPad mini didn’t falter once and, in comparison to my iPhone, the tablet’s larger screen made it a much better work companion when I was trying to be productive on the couch. The mini smoothly ran games like <em>Temple Run 2, Crossy Road</em> and <em>High Rise</em> as well, even if my attempts at beating those games were anything but.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6ff2c7d1-1ad9-11ec-9f1f-167f5d1d4fe1" style="height:1200;width:1800;" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="b80c4ae9-f469-3a9b-8a68-f361326da19c"><figcaption>The 2021 iPad mini next to Amazon&#39;s Kindle Paperwhite.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>While it didn’t affect the performance of the iPad mini I had, the storage capacity on the model you choose may have a significant impact on how you use your mini in the future. The tablet comes in 64GB and 256GB models, with the higher of the two costing $150 more than the other. That’s a significant difference in both capacity and cost, and it follows an unfortunate pattern in the iPad lineup — you’ll find the same pricing structure in the iPad Air configurations. The previous iPad mini had the same minimum storage capacity, so we didn’t even get an upgrade here and that’s a shame.</p><p>While I don’t think most people will be using the iPad mini as a laptop replacement, it would have been nice to have a 128GB model just to have an in-between option for those with tighter budgets. I would also hesitate to recommend the 64GB model to anyone that wants to use their iPad mini as the digital file folder for their documents, photos, books, scans and more. Considering iPadOS 15 takes up 7.5GB of space already, those people may quickly eat up most of their internal storage.</p><h2>With the Apple Pencil</h2><p>Another area that could eat up storage over time are handwritten notes, scribbles, doodles and other artwork you make with the second-generation Apple Pencil. The previous iPad mini supported the first-gen stylus, but I was thrilled to see the newer Apple Pencil snap on to the side of the mini and line up almost perfectly. The Pencil is almost as tall as the tablet so it truly feels like the two were made for each other.</p><p>Since I regularly use the Apple Pencil with my 11-inch iPad Pro, I was not surprised to find that using it with the iPad mini is a similar, yet more constrained, experience. But that’s not a bad thing — I actually think the iPad mini excels at being a digital notebook. It’s portable enough to come with you everywhere you go and it’s much easier to balance in your palm while you jot down notes during a walking meeting. Apple makes it really easy to take notes in iPadOS 15, too, with the Quick Note feature that’s accessible by swiping up from the bottom-right corner of the iPad. It opens a small window on the screen into which you can scribble a quick grocery list or something you don’t want to forget. Those Quick Notes get saved in the Notes app, where you can retrieve and edit them at any time.</p><p>Apple’s made the Notes app more robust over the years, so much so that it could be your main note-taking tool. But there’s no shortage of capable apps in which to use the Apple Pencil and I was happy to find that two popular ones, Procreate and GoodNotes, work just as well on the iPad mini as any other iPad. Serious artists will probably want to spring for an iPad with a larger screen because it just gives you more space to play with, both in regular and Split View. But those who are visual thinkers, those who prefer to sketch out their thoughts, will probably find the mini’s screen to be sufficient. For example, I’m in the early stages of planning a wedding and I took the iPad mini with me on a few venue tours. Not only was it much less ostentatious to take around than my larger iPad, but I could also snap quick photos with it, bring those images into Procreate, pull out colors I liked in venue fixtures and decorations and experiment with them in concept sketches.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/705189a0-1ad9-11ec-b79e-f4c3ae445fad" alt="Apple iPad mini 2021" data-uuid="8e92632f-c3cc-3928-90bd-49bea15bb6ea"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Battery life</h2><p>One thing that hasn’t changed about the iPad mini is its estimated battery life. Just like the 2019 model, Apple estimates the slab should get up to 10 hours of battery life, and again, that’s a bit of a lowball. With how much I was using the device, I essentially had to charge it every other day. The mini lasted an entire afternoon and evening filled with doodling, video streaming, emailing, light gaming and more (I used it instead of my phone for almost every task), and I was able to use it most of the next day before the battery life dropped to around 10 percent. I also ran a makeshift battery test on it, playing a video clip on repeat until the tablet died, and the mini lasted just about 12 hours.</p><p>Unlike the previous mini, the new model uses a USB-C port for charging and it’s about time. It’s good to see Apple transitioning the iPad family to USB-C, even if most people looking to buy an iPad mini probably already have a few Lightning cables strewn around their home. The mini also comes with Apple’s 20W USB-C charger, which should help power-up the device quickly.</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iPad mini&#x002019;s" href="https://amzn.to/3tXuQwY">iPad mini’s</a> spec sheet has changed quite a bit, but the appeal of the tablet remains the same. It looks and feels different thanks to the redesign and the handful of new features Apple brought to it. Still, the iPad mini remains one of Apple’s most niche devices. But niche doesn’t mean less-than — with the iPad mini so similar to the iPad Air, you won’t be sacrificing much by choosing it. However, I don’t think most people will take a look at all the new perks — things like a camera with Center Stage, USB-C charging and even the A15 Bionic chip — and be persuaded to choose the iPad mini over any other Apple tablet.</p><p>What it will come down to, as always, is size. The iPad mini remains the best small tablet out there and you probably already know if an 8-inch tablet has a place in your life. It either solves a specific problem, or it doesn’t — and if you fall into the second category, you probably prefer bigger screens anyway.</p><p>But if you updated in 2019 to the 5th-generation iPad mini, the decision to upgrade now is not entirely cut-and-dry and that’s mostly due to cost. If the 6th-generation iPad mini had the same $399 starting price as the previous model, it would be a no-brainer upgrade. Sure, that extra $100 does get you a lot, but if your 2019 iPad mini is still going strong, the higher price of the 2021 model may be too great. But for those who have a hole in their lives where a small tablet could fit, you (still) can’t get better than the iPad mini.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa628cfc-23bf-44f7-874e-02ef1d7dcf52</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632313056</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T12:17:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Tablets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/70335340-1ad9-11ec-bbd6-16a028aa88b2" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/70335340-1ad9-11ec-bbd6-16a028aa88b2" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPad mini 2021]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPad mini 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Guardians of the Galaxy' is already better than the 'Avengers' game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At this point in the creeping global takeover of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, most people have a clear idea of who the Guardians of the Galaxy are, at least according to James Gunn. There’s the bald dude who’s a tree, Zoe Saldana in green body paint, the other bald dude who isn’t a tree, Bradley Cooper as a raunchy raccoon, and the guy who used to be on <em>Parks and Recreation</em>.</p><p>This isn’t the case in <em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, and that’s a good thing. The game introduces fresh versions of the Guardians and ensures players will get to know them, placing an active emphasis on relationship-building and teamwork, rather than running and gunning. Eidos-Montréal’s interpretation of the Milano crew is familiar but refreshing, and the characters in the game are just as charming as they are in the MCU — if not moreso.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4ee536e0-1b24-11ec-8f3f-bd5afd25cd11" style="height:2160;width:3840;" alt="Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy" data-uuid="f652380d-680c-3a89-b3b0-11bfa82c808d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Square Enix</div></figure><p>The preview for <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> lasted about an hour and dropped me in the middle of chapter five: Star-Lord and his pals are on the Milano, debating whether they should pay a fine at Nova Corps headquarters. They banter and decide to do it, intermittently dealing with a purple-and-orange llama that’s stowed away on their ship from a previous mission. The llama’s name is Kammy. Drax, the vengeful yet simple warrior, calls it “the child.” It’s all very cute.</p><p>Star-Lord is the only playable character in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, but he’s able to interact with and even direct his teammates, taking advantage of their unique skills as needed. For instance, Rocket, the foul-mouthed raccoon, is good at hacking doorways, crawling through vents and fixing things, though he’ll give you an earful while he does it.</p><p>By chapter five, Star-Lord has a handful of skills and tools, including the ability to scan his environments for areas of interest or weakness. Using this overlay turns the landscape into an infrared world of neon silhouettes and bright yellow clues. If Star-Lord himself can’t use a particular item, chances are someone on his team can, and he’s able to work with them once he’s found the way forward.</p><div id="d1021a88b7fe4184a7aa3406e589da8a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oki56MQfiHI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In combat, Star-Lord can instruct his crewmates to use their special moves at any particular time, and they also react automatically to nearby enemy behavior. For example, Star-Lord can freeze an enemy with his ice gun and Groot, the powerful tree creature, will start wailing on the frozen foe, no player input required. There’s also a huddle function that can turn the tide of a big battle — Peter Quill calls the team together and listens to their thoughts on how the fight is going, and then he determines whether to encourage them or check their egos using a range of 1980s pop-rock lyrics. If he picks the right tone, the entire team gets a big boost so they can start spamming attacks; if he picks the wrong words, only Star-Lord gets the damage augmentation.</p><p>Fights in chapter five are fast-paced and packed with enemies, meaning the Guardians are often spread across the environment, waging their own tiny wars. Star-Lord’s ability to call in his crewmates’ special powers adds a layer of rapid-fire strategy to the gunbattles, and this system should only become more robust as the game progresses.</p><p>Interacting with the Guardian NPCs is a critical component of the game’s non-combat moments, when players have to communicate and solve puzzles to progress. <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> uses a Telltale-style narrative system that alerts players with text in the upper-right corner when something significant has gone down — think “Gamora will remember that” — and in conversation, there are often multiple responses for players to choose from, sometimes with a timer attached. Seemingly innocuous decisions, such as whether to respond to an audio cue, can significantly change how the game plays out, for instance jump-starting a battle or creating an opportunity for the Guardians to sneak in.</p><section data-eng-breakout="0824bb06a9354d119398b86dc336a5c0" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4ee4e8c0-1b24-11ec-b7eb-38923e2e0281" alt="Marvel&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy" data-uuid="937f5467-08e2-383b-bbe7-635e3ec25d75"></section><p>Relationships are everything in <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>. The core theme of the game is grief, according to developers, and even as the Guardians joke their way across the stars, they each deal with a unique sense of loss. This is, ironically, what brings them together. The game&#39;s music plays into the emotional mood, with plenty of licensed ’80s hits and an original album from Star-Lord that taps into feelings of being an outcast and finding your chosen family.</p><p>It’s hard to say if Eidos-Montréal has captured the right balance of emotion and action throughout <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, but the preview is encouraging. The developers aren’t afraid to let dialogue and puzzle-solving breathe for long stretches of the action, while battles themselves are full and frenzied. At any rate, it already feels way better than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-avengers-poor-sales-195000119.html"><em>Marvel’s Avengers</em></a>.</p><p><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> is due to hit PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 4, and PS5 on October 26th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/guardians-galaxy-game-preview-marvel-square-enix-130003598.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">481fed65-48e6-4b88-a813-de096d46cb54</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632260918</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T21:48:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/23aaa000-1b24-11ec-b9f8-ed81dceed126" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/23aaa000-1b24-11ec-b9f8-ed81dceed126" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's department store plans reportedly include high-tech dressing rooms]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If Amazon opens mini department stores <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-department-stores-122954800.html">as rumored</a>, they could include high-tech dressing rooms and the retailer&#39;s own private-label clothing brands, according to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-amazons-department-store-plans-high-tech-dressing-rooms-its-own-apparel-brands-11632303002"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> report.

Two years, and multiple design improvements later, PFF is set to release a smaller, more nimble version which they&#39;re calling the Gitamini<em>&nbsp;</em>this October.</p><p>With a cargo volume of up to nearly 2,000 cubic inches and capable of carrying up to 44 pounds of gear and traveling at a top speed of 22 mph, the original Gita was a startlingly large machine able to hold a shopping carts-worth of groceries and keep up with cyclists. However, the Gita&#39;s size made it a liability to other pedestrians when navigating on crowded sidewalks, especially the earlier versions that relied on a belt-mounted tracker to know where its owners were.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Gitamini, on the other hand, is about the size of a Border Collie (990 cubic square inches of cargo space) and weighs just 28 pounds. It can carry up to 20 pounds of gear and thanks to external handles the mini can easily be hoisted over curbs, stairs and other obstacles even when fully loaded. The mini is rated for a maximum range of 21 miles or around six hours of use before needing a recharge. What&#39;s more, PFF has traded in the belt-based tracker for advanced optics and machine vision. With the push of an onboard button, the <em>mini</em> will autonomously find, recognize and follow its &quot;leader&quot; using only visual and radar cues like color and motion — the robot does not require a GPS, cell, or wireless network connection in order to do so.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ce7b2f20-1b17-11ec-87ff-69c44f5b199f" alt="Gita and mini" data-uuid="0c3e4abb-74ef-3c09-a4fb-1c0530af50d1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Piaggio Fast Forward</div></figure><p>The mini is also equipped with what the company is calling &quot;pedestrian etiquette software.&quot; This trains the robot to follow its leader at a safe distance and speed while proactively anticipating the movements of the people around them.  The mini&#39;s<em>&nbsp;</em>wheels are independently powered, enabling it to make Rivian-esque zero-radius tank turns, while a third motor is dedicated to maintaining the robot&#39;s balance when accelerating and braking.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Seeing the initial consumer response to Gita proved to us what a pioneer the product was within the consumer robotics industry,” said Greg Lynn, PFF’s CEO, said in a prepared statement. “The ask to ourselves then became, ‘how do we take what we have heard from people and create something different for a new segment of consumers?’’ Gitamini is the company&#39;s answer.</p><p>The Gitamini is slated to go on sale for $1,850 <a href="https://mygita.com/">on October 15th</a> while the original, larger Gita will see a price reduction to $3,250 at the same time.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/this-robotic-backpack-follows-its-leader-wherever-you-may-wander-110030566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c2fc2d5-e3f9-4e5b-97f5-1b8d6434f980</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 11:00:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632307000</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T10:36:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a512c030-1b17-11ec-aad6-049c52ab2ba2" width="6582" height="4388" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a512c030-1b17-11ec-aad6-049c52ab2ba2" width="6582" height="4388" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Piaggio Fast Forward]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Gitamini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GitaMini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Pokémon Unite' has arrived on Android and iOS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-unite-switch-mobile-release-date-143043996.html"><em>Pokémon Unite</em></a> is now available for download and is ready to play on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemonunite">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-unite/id1512321575">iOS</a>.

In fact, as <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9633425/twitch-nmpa-music-publishers-agreement"><em>Billboard</em></a> points out, it&#39;s not a licensing deal at all. According to the publication, the Amazon-owned livestreaming service made a financial settlement for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/riaa-nmpa-letter-to-twitch-on-unlicensed-music-151703321.html">past usage</a> of licensed music on the platform. Twitch has also told creators in an email that it&#39;s putting together a new process that publishers and right holders can use to report content.&nbsp;</p><p>The new process is different from a DMCA and will start with a warning instead of a penalty. When a rights holder reports a stream, Twitch will issue a warning and remove the clips containing unauthorized music. In case of a flagrant violation — say, the rebroadcasting of concerts and the leak of unreleased tracks — then Twitch may issue a penalty outright, depending on the user&#39;s history.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its email, Twitch says the new process is more forgiving of users who may have inadvertently caught music they have no authority to use in their streams. Mike Futter of <a href="https://virtualeconcast.com/"><em>Virtual Economy Podcast</em></a> notes, though, that the new process just makes it easier for music publishers to flag users and that it doesn&#39;t make things better for creators. Streamers can&#39;t dispute a report if they&#39;re flagged for violation, since Twitch will just remove their videos. Even users who&#39;ve previously secured the rights to use a piece of music can get their content deleted if they&#39;re falsely flagged.</p><div id="8ba6e6e0590645918d3f909d83257f52"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Full text of the Twitch email (with alt text): <a href="https://t.co/S0xD9TDK1X">pic.twitter.com/S0xD9TDK1X</a></p>— Mike Futter (@Futterish) <a href="https://twitter.com/Futterish/status/1440390844020772864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p><em>Billboard</em> says, however, that Twitch and the NMPA also agreed on a time window to hash out how music will be handled on the platform going forward. Twitch is reportedly offering NMPA members an opt-in deal allowing future collaborations. As for the new reporting process, the platform told creators that it has more information to share in the coming weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-deal-nmpa-044806416.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f842ebd2-72dd-46ef-910d-682e20627c08</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 04:48:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632286106</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T04:48:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/0f612e20-072a-11eb-8ebf-8c1f3d1cc752" width="4039" height="2693" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/0f612e20-072a-11eb-8ebf-8c1f3d1cc752" width="4039" height="2693" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Trutschel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - OCTOBER 11: In this photo illustration the logo of live streaming video platform Twitch is displayed on a smartphone on October 11, 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

Without much fanfare, the company has been quietly working on a free Oculus Quest game called <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3632378823549307/"><em>Eden Unearthed</em></a>. Spotted by <a href="https://uploadvr.com/netflix-eden-unearthed-app-lab/"><em><ins>UploadVR</ins></em></a>, the game is available through the App Lab, which means it hasn’t gone through the full Oculus review process. The listing says the game was both developed and published by Netflix, but provides few other hints about its origins.</p><p>What we can say is that it was almost certainly envisioned as a tie-in for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-40-anime-titles-2021-074304890.html"><em><ins>Eden </ins></em><ins>anime series</ins></a> the company released back in May. What’s interesting here is that there are two separate versions of the app with different release dates listed. The v0.7 release came out on April 20th, while the v0.8 was released in August. That fact, along with the App Lab listing, would appear to suggest Netflix is still working on the game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the moment, it’s hard to say whether <em>Eden Unearthed </em>represents the kind of video game release we can expect from Netflix moving forward. In July, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html"><ins>hired former Oculus and EA executive Mike Verdu</ins></a> to help it build out a gaming team.

The service is launching in South Korea and Taiwan the same day, and will reach Hong Kong on November 16th. This is arguably the largest expansion for Disney+ in the region to date following rollouts in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Disney+ Day will also include a &quot;look toward the future&quot; of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. If you aren&#39;t a fan of superheroes, you&#39;ll have general access to <em>Jungle Cruise</em>, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-book-of-boba-fett-mandalorian-spin-off-series-143119062.html">Boba Fett</a> origins special, <em>Home Sweet Home Alone</em> and shorts linked to <em>Frozen</em>, Pixar&#39;s <em>Luca</em> and <em>The Simpsons</em>.</p><p>The content pile-up isn&#39;t a total shock. On top of the anniversary, all these releases could help fend off a wave of higher-profile <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wheel-of-time-first-trailer-184934716.html">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-cowboy-bebop-release-date-photos-152038789.html">Netflix</a> titles arriving around the same time. At the same time, it might keep <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-q4-2020-earnings-224854835.html">Disney&#39;s streaming momentum</a> going through what&#39;s left of 2021.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/shang-chi-disney-plus-release-date-203743090.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d7e564f0-eec3-4ba8-a5e5-17bb9dcf89bf</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 20:37:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632256664</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T20:37:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0e5000b0-1b15-11ec-bb87-21ced18cf86c" width="1920" height="1277" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0e5000b0-1b15-11ec-bb87-21ced18cf86c" width="1920" height="1277" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Simu Liu in 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Simu Liu in 'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Beat Saber' gets a $13 Billie Eilish track pack with  'Bad Guy' and 'Bury a Friend']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has just released a <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/happier-than-ever-billie-eilish-music-pack-beat-saber/">Billie Eilish pack for <em>Beat Saber</em></a>.
