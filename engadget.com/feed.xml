Because we’ve seen this sort of behavior before. It’s called greenwashing.</p><h2>What is Greenwashing?</h2><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/greenwashing"><ins>Merriam-Webster</ins></a> defines greenwashing as “expressions of environmentalist concerns especially as a cover for products, policies, or activities.” The term was first coined in 1986 by environmentalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Westerveld"><ins>Jay Westerveld</ins></a> in an essay examining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212726/http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/02/12/the-history-of-greenwashing-how-dirty-towels-impacted-the-green/"><ins>the hotel industry’s practice</ins></a> of leaving placards in guest rooms admonishing them to reuse their towels to help “save the environment.” Back then, people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies"><ins>got their news from three places</ins></a>: newspapers, television and radio — the same sources for virtually all advertising at the time. This information availability imbalance created a system wherein corporations could promote themselves in any flattering shade they wished, regardless of their actual actions, with little fear of the public actually realizing that a deception had even occurred.</p><p>The practice of greenwashing in America goes as far back as 1953 — though it wasn’t called as such at the time — when beverage manufacturers launched the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/05/899391551/reframing-history-the-litter-myth"><ins>Keep America Beautiful</ins></a> campaign, reminding the public to be good environmental stewards and not litter, in what was actually an effort to forestall incoming regulations on the use of disposable containers. Greenwashing metastasized in the 1980s as Big Oil companies ladled out their own laudations while they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings"><ins>sought to minimize their own liability and culpability</ins></a> in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-exxonmobil-20170822-story.html"><ins>environmental pollution scandals</ins></a> and global warming. These companies went so far as to work to actively prevent the government from <a href="https://influencemap.org/report/Climate-Lobbying-by-the-Fossil-Fuel-Sector"><ins>passing clean energy laws</ins></a>. But you wouldn’t know it from their television ads.</p><div id="3e43c1176cca4f3a85044c65bfdafa02"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bReBO55XzZc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The spot above is from ​​Chevron’s People Do campaign. It should be noted that many of the programs promoted in that campaign were actually government-mandated actions and that while this campaign was running, Chevron was repeatedly found in violation of the <a href="https://www.ogj.com/general-interest/companies/article/17218864/chevron-fined-under-clean-water-act"><ins>Clean Air and Water Acts</ins></a>, and was caught <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-14/entertainment/ca-42437_1_chevron-ads"><ins>dumping oil in wildlife refuges</ins></a>.</p><p>Exxon’s actions through the ‘90s were equally abhorrent. The company continually muddied the waters around humanity’s role in climate change, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/"><ins>knowing full well</ins></a> how the burning of fossil fuels inflamed the growing crisis.</p><p>In 2017, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa815f"><ins>a Harvard study</ins></a> of ExxonMobil’s climate change communications (both internal memos and public-facing advertorial newspaper content) produced between 1977 and 2014 found that while more than 80 percent of internal documents acknowledged that human activity was largely responsible for global warming, just 12 percent of the company’s advertorials did the same.</p><p>&quot;Within hours of publishing our study, ExxonMobil responded with ad hominem attacks,&quot; Harvard Research Associate Geoffrey Supran, told <a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/stories/greenwashing-the-tipping-point/"><em><ins>Client Earth</ins></em></a> last year. &quot;I was invited by the European Parliament to testify about ExxonMobil&#39;s history of climate denial. The day before, they sent a private memo (which has now been leaked) to Members of Parliament to try to discredit me. If these experiences tell us anything, it&#39;s that the Exxon tiger hasn&#39;t changed its stripes.&quot;</p><h2>Greenwashing in the modern era</h2><h3></h3><p>Greenwashing remains a widely-used marketing tactic even today — and not just the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq-ZupAJTyY"><ins>mealy-mouthed word salads regurgitated by oil executives</ins></a> during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/climate/oil-executives-house-disinformation-testimony.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes"><ins>House Oversight Committee hearing this Thursday</ins></a>.</p><p>Take bottled water, for instance. Nestle alone has spent millions of ad dollars over recent years in an effort to convince the public that, as it claimed in 2008, “bottled water is the most environmentally responsible consumer product in the world.”​​ This despite the fact that barely 31 percent of plastic water bottles <a href="http://www.ecowatch.com/americas-deadly-love-affair-with-bottled-water-has-to-end-1882099598.html"><ins>actually get recycled</ins></a> and the rest end up cluttering landfills and the ocean — scientists estimate that around <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1260352"><ins>8 million metric tons of plastic entered the ocean annually</ins></a>.</p><div id="977cc0d6ffe8407a8d4a34b602235d0c"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mOpa8kd6fBI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>And they are far from alone. Coca-Cola came under fire in 2015 in Australia when it rolled out Coke Life, a supposedly light sugar variant packaged in a bright green can. Sure it made consumers feel like they were making a health conscious purchasing decision but that was despite <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/healthcare/cocacola-accused-of-greenwashing-with-launch-of-sugarreduced-coke-life-20150330-1mas6u.html"><ins>health advocates pointing out that</ins></a> “the reduction to 10 teaspoons of sugar in a 600ml bottle made little difference in terms of health impacts.” More recently the company launched its <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/news/why-a-world-without-waste-is-possible"><ins>World Without Waste</ins></a> campaign which, at its essence, pushed consumers to simply recycle more, rather than actually adjust the way the company conducts its business.</p><div id="2674d7a223734153b65c7e8b5d3af9bb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The fashion industry is a huge contributor to the climate-and ecological emergency, not to mention its impact on the countless workers and communities who are being exploited around the world in order for some to enjoy fast fashion that many treat as disposables. 1/3 <a href="https://t.co/pZirCE1uci">pic.twitter.com/pZirCE1uci</a></p>— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1424423822854397960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>In 2013, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/greenwashing-or-real-prog_b_3503137"><ins>Tyson Meats was taken to task</ins></a> over the fawning self-framing of how it cares for its animals and their relative well-being, not two years before <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/10/27/mercy-for-animals-accuses-tysons-of-abuse-at-mississippi-chicken-slaughterhouse/74704928/"><ins>five Tyson supplier employees were charged with 33 counts of criminal animal cruelty</ins></a> for repeatedly kicking and punching pigs. And who can forget Volkswagen, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/07/final-court-summary-ftc-reports-volkswagen-repaid-more-than-9-billion"><ins>which launched a “Clean Diesel” marketing campaign amid the Dieselgate emissions scandal</ins></a>?</p><h2>Why Greenwashing works so well</h2><h3></h3><p>So why do companies insist on greenwashing their operations rather than actually reform themselves? Because it is far more profitable to simply adjust public perception than it is to make meaningful reforms. <a href="https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2015/the-sustainability-imperative-2/"><ins>A 2015 Nielsen poll</ins></a> found that 66 percent of respondents would be willing to pay a premium for “environmentally sustainable products” and among those willing to pay more more than 50 percent were influenced by sustainability factors such as “a company being environmentally friendly (58 percent), and company being known for its commitment to social value (56 percent.)”</p><p>It’s also because we, collectively, keep falling for it. Consumers’ desires to help address the climate crisis, especially in the face of barely tepid responses from world governments, primes us to view virtually any action on that account as a positive one. “SDGs [<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals"><ins>Sustainable Development Goals</ins></a>] and ‘net zero’ have kind of created an opportunity for a lot more greenwashing, because it allows you to describe yourself as a green company when you’re doing a thing that’s fundamentally not green,” Dave Powell, co-presenter of the <a href="http://www.sustainababble.fish/"><em><ins>Sustainababble</ins></em></a> podcast and the former Head of Environment at the New Economics Foundation, told <a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/stories/greenwashing-the-tipping-point/"><em><ins>Client Earth</ins></em></a>. “You effectively buy your way out of trouble, for example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-07-30/what-happens-after-pledges-to-plant-millions-of-trees"><ins>by promising to plant large numbers of trees</ins></a>.”</p><p>&quot;As part of their climate strategies, many companies are relying on voluntary carbon offsetting. However, if not done well, offsetting can result in greenwashing,” Dr. Aoife Brophy Haney, Research Lecturer at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford, added. “To mitigate this risk, government and society at large should support the use of best practice guidelines, such as the recently released ‘<a href="https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/publications/reports/Oxford-Offsetting-Principles-2020.pdf"><ins>Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting</ins></a>’, to help ensure offsetting is done in a rigorous and credible way that ultimately contributes to net zero goals.&quot;</p><p>And, most importantly, companies continue to engage in greenwashing because there is very little downside to doing so, at least from a regulatory perspective. In the US, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/environmental-claims-summary-green-guides"><ins>the FTC guidelines for environmental marketing claims are only voluntary</ins></a>, though the FTC does retain the right to <a href="https://sustainablebrands.com/read/marketing-and-comms/ftc-cracking-down-on-misleading-unsubstantiated-biodegradability-claims"><ins>prosecute outright false or misleading advertisements</ins></a>.</p><p>However, cracks in the greenwashing facade may be beginning to show, starting in the financial sector, as regulators’ interest in <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/best-esg-funds#:~:text=ESG%20funds%20are%20mutual%20funds,funds%20are%20not%20individual%20stocks."><ins>ESG fund</ins></a> (environmental, social and governance) oversight grows. As <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/greenwashing-probes-prompt-panic-among-esg-funds-theres-a-big-reputational-risk-20211025"><em><ins>Financial News London</ins></em></a> reported Monday, German asset manager DWS <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-06/deutsche-bank-s-dws-orders-fresh-probe-into-esg-greenwash-claims"><ins>has recently been investigated</ins></a> by both US and German regulatory agencies after a former employee accused the company of fudging the environmental credentials in its 2020 annual report.</p><p>“You have to be careful, as there is a big reputational risk,” an unnamed senior executive at a European asset manager, told <em>FN London</em>. “We’re not saying we were bulls***ing before, but there’s a recognition now that it’s more complicated.”</p><p>“Most have probably been a bit too pushy in marketing their alleged ESG expertise and they are now applying more caution,” ​​Philip Kalus, managing partner at consultancy Accelerando Associates, added. “Some would even say there is panic in the house. Nobody wants to be the next one being accused, but it is an important and overdue wake-up call for the industry.”</p><div id="79b61a221f15426c812e2a6aaed705a7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MbHuSHGZf5U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>That’s not to say that environmental pledges made by Apple, Google, Microsoft or Amazon are meant to intentionally gaslight the public (though Exxon, Shell and Chevron absolutely did). These companies have a vested financial interest in at least appearing as positively as possible to their customers because, frankly, nobody’s going to have time to talk about the slick new features of the Pixel 8 or iOS 15 when we’re in the midst of a global climate meltdown-slash-<a href="https://www.undispatch.com/bad-news-world-will-begin-running-water-2050-good-news-not-2050-yet/"><ins>water war</ins></a>.</p><p>Is Google’s “moonshot goal” of operating its data centers and campuses entirely on carbon-free energy by 2030 going to make more than a blip of difference when it comes to mitigating the impacts of climate change? Probably not, definitely not on its own and certainly no more so than Microsoft’s promise to reduce water use in its data centers by 95 percent by 2024 or Apple’s plan to build robots <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-21-apples-liam-robot-takes-apart-your-iphone-for-recycling.html"><ins>to more effectively recycle old handsets</ins></a>. But these claims do not, in and of themselves, constitute greenwashing. Their changes may not be enough to make a noticeable impact at this point, but these good faith efforts attempt to do something, <em>anything</em>, to stave off what could well be humanity’s self-inflicted extinction. And given how America’s most recent effort to invest in environmentally responsible energy technologies was single-handedly killed off by the coal-loving Senator from West Virginia, these sorts of corporate initiatives may likely be the best we’ll soon see.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/is-big-tech-greenwashing-its-environmental-responsibilities-ahead-of-cop-26-170038455.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f44f9aad-26dd-4c9e-b58b-9bbaf124bd48</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635525046</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T16:31:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2353c710-3868-11ec-bef7-14f30f9a0ec8" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2353c710-3868-11ec-bef7-14f30f9a0ec8" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2021/10/24: An activist dressed as a 'scrubber' cleans the 'greenwashing machine' during the protest outside the Science Museum.

Viewers were instantly obsessed, labeling her &quot;tall vampire lady&quot; and demanding to know everything about her, which prompted Capcom to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-dimitrescu-tall-lady-020513974.html">reveal her exact height</a> — 9&#39;6&quot; including her hat and heels — months before <em>Village</em> launched in May.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In-game, Lady Dimitrescu commands three fly-infested, murderous daughters, and hunts the main character, Ethan Winters, across the opulent rooms of her castle. She crouches through doorways and slices at Ethan with long, blade-like fingernails, hurling insults like &quot;rat&quot; and &quot;man-thing&quot; at him the entire time, a mutant dominatrix in a flowing white dress.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8831d780-3836-11ec-bfe7-b1f747ceb39f" alt="Lady Dimitrescu" data-uuid="f7f3ce1e-ebf0-3854-adf2-b183f9749a18"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Twilight Sparkle</div></figure><p>The intrigue surrounding Lady Dimitrescu has persisted since <em>Village</em>&#39;s launch, and fans are betting (or maybe just hoping really hard) that the game&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-dlc-230004534.html">first bit of DLC</a> will focus on her specifically.</p><p>Until then, and in the spirit of Spooky Season, we have insight into Lady Dimitrescu&#39;s creation from <em>Village</em> presentation director Masato Miyazaki, the person in charge of the game&#39;s motion-capture process. Earlier this year, Miyazaki shared details with Engadget about how Lady Dimitrescu came to be, from concept to mocap, including the ways actress Maggie Robertson brought her to legendary life.</p><p><strong><em>Engadget:</em></strong><strong> Did Lady Dimitrescu&#39;s design change throughout development?</strong></p><p><em>Masato Miyazaki:</em> Alcina Dimitrescu’s incredible height was conceived from the beginning and was not changed during development. The same goes for her wide brim hat and her white dress as well. However, the characteristic of her long protruding nails was something added part way through the development process. It was an idea that was implemented later as a means of adding physical elements that would make her more terrifying when you encounter her.</p><p><strong>Lady Dimitrescu is alluring and seductive </strong>—<strong> was she always meant to be a sultry character, or did that emerge during mocap?</strong></p><p>In the early stages of development, she was described as a bewitching character who would capture and toy with her victims. She was designed to embody equal parts beauty and horror. Based on this, the scenario writer fleshed her characterization out even further with dialogue, but she wasn’t fully realized just yet. It was through Maggie’s performance that the character was finally given life.</p><p>As with any character, I believe that the moment the script is handed over to the actor, the character becomes theirs. The character&#39;s personality and intentions are very much refined by the actor. The character Lady Dimitrescu was truly realized and came to fruition with each of Maggie’s performances.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe295820-3834-11ec-a44b-5486ec0bd096" alt="Lady Dimitrescu (Maggie Robertson) in Resident Evil Village" data-uuid="944ebc48-bc9c-34a5-abc5-b0d7327e2427"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Capcom</div></figure><p><strong>What tricks did you use to make Maggie Robertson as tall as possible during mocap sessions?</strong></p><p>Although Maggie Robertson is quite tall herself, she still cannot reach the height that we envisioned for Lady Dimitrescu. Utilizing some means of extending out her height would jeopardize her performance, so it wasn’t something we could consider. We asked Maggie to act naturally. However, that still left us with the height difference between Maggie and Lady Dimitrescu that had to be addressed. We devised a few methods to counteract this issue.</p><p>First off, we shot with a mixture of backgrounds according to two standards: human scale and Lady Dimitrescu scale. While other characters performed with surroundings that fit human scale, Lady Dimitrescu’s acting was done in front of a background that fit her scale. Everyone performed with one another, but with this mixture of environments. We figured this would be the best means of allowing the actors to give their best performances without any kind of impediment. We made sure the furniture was laid out in a way so that the actors would be facing each other.</p><p>The other aspect that we made sure to stay conscious of was making sure the actors’ lines of sight were in the right positions. We set up markers so that the actors could imagine the correct height. These markers show the correct position of the eye lines and where the limbs actually are. It&#39;s a simple adjustment, but it makes a big difference in the actors&#39; performances.</p><div id="b57949c2c9fd4690a3b380e2e834efcd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How the sausage gets made part 2: This is what we used to mark Lady D&#39;s actual size and eye lines.

We carefully set up the rigs of the CG characters to gracefully handle as much of the physical differences between the character and actor as possible. We wanted to make sure that we set things up so that the animators would have a relatively easier time handling any kind of miscalculations that happened along the way.</p><p><strong>What was the strangest prop you used throughout the mocap process?</strong></p><p>There are several, but there are two that I would like to mention. The first is the cane carried by the old woman we meet at the beginning of the village. When you see it in the game, it’s a strange artifact with a lot of components jingling about. The studio crew crafted a prop that resembles the design.</p><p>The second is the goggles that our actor Todd wore as he played the role of Ethan Winters. Since the game is from a first-person perspective through the eyes of Ethan Winters, the camera movements are based on the movements of Todd&#39;s head. Todd reprises his role as Ethan from the previous game and his performances are absolutely excellent, but there were moments where the camera would go wild during more heated scenarios. In order to suppress this from happening, the studio engineer created a pair of special goggles by hand.&nbsp;</p><p>They actually turned out to look very similar to swimming goggles. The assumption was that the narrower field of vision would result in less head movement. I’m still not entirely sure how effective they ended up being, but the engineer’s enthusiasm and Todd having fun wearing the goggles are one of the many wonderful memories I have from the whole experience.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-lady-dimitrescu-mocap-interview-halloween-2021-163032866.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b3a5bf4-595d-4788-842b-80db5c238754</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635524142</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T16:15:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8831d780-3836-11ec-bfe7-b1f747ceb39f" width="870" height="473" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/64ebd7d0-3836-11ec-b3ee-895b0690b883" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Capcom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lady Dimitrescu]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lady Dimitrescu]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[We won't have electric airplanes until battery tech improves]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today’s commercial airliners are not exactly fuel efficient.

To be fair though, due to inefficiencies inherent to internal combustion engines, that figure drops to around 14 times the energy density of a li-ion battery if you’re comparing equal weights of fuel and batteries.</p><p>For example, a Tesla Model 3’s li-ion-based battery boasts an energy density of 260 Wh/kg while <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2021/07/30/catl-reveals-sodium-ion-battery-with-160-wh-kg-energy-density/"><ins>CATL announced earlier this year</ins></a> that it had built a sodium-ion battery with 160 Wh/kg density (though it hopes to get that up to 200 Wh/kg by 2023).

When a battery cell, or even an area within a single cell, malfunctions due to mechanical, thermal, or electrochemical failure, its temperature can rise beyond safe levels causing the cell to first produce lithium off-gasses, causing the cell walls to bulge, then rupture, releasing the entirety of its energy reserve. When a cell bursts it can damage and overheat surrounding cells, setting off a cascading failure that results in explosion and fire. When that happens to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-chevy-bolt-over-battery-fire-reports-230044311.html"><ins>Chevy Volt</ins></a>, the car will likely be a write off (fingers crossed it didn’t also set your house on fire) but if <a href="https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/251352/251352.pdf#page=187"><ins>such a failure</ins></a> were to occur in-flight on an electrified 747, the loss of life would be catastrophic.</p><p>To minimize the chances of a full-blown runaway from occurring, <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/preventing-thermal-runaway-in-lithium-ion-energy-storage-systems/"><ins>early detection of cell failures is key</ins></a>. As off-gassing typically occurs minutes before a cell ruptures, the presence of a monitoring system which compares sensors positioned close to a li-ion battery against those collected by a reference sensor further away can alert for the presence of a failing cell. And to negate any gases that have already been released, fire suppression systems armed with inert gas — to prevent the offgasses from reaching combustible levels when mixed with atmospheric oxygen — can be employed as well. Of course regular maintenance and robust inspections also help prevent cell failures before the situation becomes explosive.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f3cafc0-373e-11ec-bfff-d4dbaf919a6b" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Spirit of Innovation" data-uuid="4c5c22ac-9ece-31e7-ad42-e873a391ba40"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rolls-Royce</div></figure><p>Battery electric planes will also provide unique challenges in balancing air speed and range, though for Rolls-Royce, it’s not even a question — speed all the way.

The feat was certified by the World Air Sports Federation (FAI) as the fastest electrically powered flight by an aircraft weighing less than 1,000 kg at takeoff, beating the previous record (set in 2013) by just over 8 mph (13 kph).</p><p>In addition to the 3-kilometer record, Rolls-Royce has the opportunity to also set FAI records for a 15km distance and “time to altitude,” basically how quickly the plane can take off and reach a specific height. “It needs to be a significant number,” Rolls-Royce Director of Engineering and Technology – Civil Aerospace, Simon Burr, told <a href="https://www.aerosociety.com/news/race-for-power/"><em><ins>Aerosociety</ins></em></a>. “We’re planning to fly over 300mph.

The Nemesis NXT already holds the 3km FAI record with a recorded top speed of 415mph (667.8km) using a 400hp Lycoming internal combustion engine.</p><p>The Rolls-Royce team has swapped that Lycoming engine out for a trio of YASA 750v electric motors producing around 400kW (530hp) while the fuel tank has been replaced with three independent battery packs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f3fbd00-373e-11ec-bef9-7e9ade54bdcc" style="height:931;width:1980;" alt="Spirit of Innovation" data-uuid="c70f3aec-b5cf-3c58-937f-e55b28879658"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rolls-Royce</div></figure><p>“The main challenge of electrification is weight,” Rolls-Royce Flight Test Engineer Andy Roberts said during a September media briefing. Not only did the 6,000-cell battery system aboard the Nemesis NXT shift the aircraft’s center of balance, the 450kg battery system also doesn&#39;t get lighter over time as conventional fuel tanks would, which could impact the plane’s performance during the later stages of the run. The batteries are so substantial that Rolls-Royce Chief Test Pilot Phill O’Dell had to lose 2kg of bodyweight to help keep the overall aircraft weight within operating margins.</p><p>Thermal runaway is a very real concern for the Rolls-Royce team, as they’ll be pushing these batteries to their absolute limits during the flight. In order to mitigate this issue cells are separated by liquid-cooling plates and stored in cork-wrapped fireproof cases (the porous cork material helps diffuse heat). Should a cell overheat to the point of venting off-gasses, the plane is equipped with an inert gas suppression and ventilation system as well.</p><div id="68c747635feb4e9bb8de9f8800ff27db"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/EC8aZkq" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>On September 15th, the <em>Spirit of Innovation</em> made its maiden test flight from the UK Ministry of Defence’s <a href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/our-organisation/stations/mod-boscombe-down/"><ins>Boscombe Down</ins></a> airfield, flying for 15 minutes.

The military will “demonstrate” the design sometime next year. The prototype will “produce a lethal output greater than anything fielded to date,” said General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems, the other company working on the project. “This technology represents a leap-ahead capability for air and missile defense that is necessary to support the Army’s modernization efforts and defeat next-generation threats in a multi-domain battlespace.”</p><p>Even if it’s only a demonstration, the system represents a significant step up from the lasers the military has had access to in the past.

Both run on M1 processors, giving them powerful performance and making them the best laptop alternatives Apple has made yet. They also have 5G support, a USB-C port that double as a Thunderbolt connector with USB 4.0 compatibility and new Center Stage cameras. The latter works to keep you in the center of the frame when on video calls, and that will make a big difference whether you&#39;re on a Zoom meeting or just FaceTiming with your family.</p><p>Most people probably don&#39;t need 1TB of space, but it&#39;ll be useful if you&#39;re a creative professional using the iPad Pro for both work and play, or someone who wants to ditch their old laptop for a hybrid device.

Other than to reveal it was working with Subaru to develop the SUV and that it would include its upcoming e-TNGA powertrain, the company didn’t share many details about the bZ4X. On Friday, it changed that by unveiling the <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/toyota/36254760.html">production version of the vehicle</a>.</p><div id="3f43ff4b48d24e1c87df7c431171deb7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d9qp2eoOWCk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Toyota will offer the bZ4X in front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive variants. The former will feature a single 150 kW capable of accelerating the car from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in 8.4 seconds. Per the WLTC standard, the automaker claims the FWD model’s 71.4 kWh battery will allow it to travel approximately 500 kilometers or 310 miles on a single charge. Expect that estimate to decrease once the EPA tests the car. It’s also worth noting these measurements come from the Japanese model, which may end up featuring different specifications to whatever model(s) Toyota releases in the US.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7c2a78f0-38bf-11ec-b7e7-8fc2f2429f9c" style="height:1199;width:1600;" alt="bZ4X" data-uuid="2646e414-c151-377e-86d7-1cbb15b93e3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Toyota</div></figure><p>The battery will support 150 kW DC fast charging, allowing it to go from dead to 80 percent after about 30 minutes of charging. As for the AWD model, it will feature two 80kW motors, one built into each axle, for a total power output of 160 kW. It can accelerate from zero to 100 kilometers per hour in 7.7 seconds. Toyota estimates the ranges of the AWD model at 460 kilometers or 285 miles on a single charge. In both variants, the battery is integrated into the chassis, a design choice the automaker helps lower the SUV’s center of gravity and improve the rigidity of the chassis.</p><p>Toyota also plans to equip the bZ4X with some nifty extra features. One of those is a solar roof the automaker says will generate about 1120 miles worth of free power generation. It will also offer a steer-by-wire system that removes the mechanical connection between the steering wheel and front wheels. Both features will be available in select models.</p><p>The bZ4X will debut in the US and other markets in mid-2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-bz4x-details-140056332.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">809b1336-cbdb-419e-9839-dc45faac014e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 14:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635516060</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T14:01:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/54c3cd70-38bf-11ec-87ef-fa7aec7072a7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/54c3cd70-38bf-11ec-87ef-fa7aec7072a7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toyota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toyota bZ4X]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Toyota bZ4X]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cricket brings 5G to all of its phone plans]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cricket is no longer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cricket-wireless-5g-launch-201240533.html">reserving 5G</a> for its priciest service tier. As of today, 5G is <a href="https://www.cricketwireless.com/cell-phone-plans">enabled</a> for all of the prepaid carrier&#39;s plans. As you might guess, the provider is also doing away with the modest 8Mbps cap on most of its plans. You can pay as little as $30 per month (for one line) for 5G, to put it another way — important if you&#39;re more interested in raw speed than anything else.</p><p>There are some caveats. Cricket isn&#39;t changing data caps for its two lowest-priced plans, so you could burn through the modest 2GB or 10GB allotments that much sooner. You also don&#39;t have many choices for 5G phones if you buy directly from Cricket, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a> range as well as a handful of low-end Motorola and Samsung models. You&#39;ll still have a strong incentive to use the higher-end tiers, and you may want to bring your own phone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s no secret as to why AT&amp;T is making Cricket more appealing, though. Cricket added 2 million customers (now 12.4 million total) in just the past two years. While AT&amp;T&#39;s regular service clearly has more overall subscribers, Cricket is the hotter property in terms of relative growth. Adding 5G to more plans could keep that momentum alive. And simply speaking, Cricket needed to catch up. Rivals like Boost Mobile and T-Mobile&#39;s Metro already offer 5G across multiple tiers. Your choice of prepaid carriers may now boil down to specific plan features and network quality.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cricket-5g-no-speed-cap-all-plans-130022473.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3e582c85-e506-4d2c-8bda-ca695fe5d7d7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 13:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635455629</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T21:13:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cricket]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e4e5c400-3813-11ec-bfe7-50ec106670ff" width="4558" height="3043" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e4e5c400-3813-11ec-bfe7-50ec106670ff" width="4558" height="3043" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[William Howard via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Wilson, NC / March 29, 2018: A Cricket sign is displayed above the entrance to their retail store in Wilson, North Carolina.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cricket cellular phone and wireless device storefront]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Assassin's Creed Infinity' game won't be free-to-play]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Assassin&#39;s Creed Infinity</em> won&#39;t be a free-to-play online game, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed during the developer&#39;s latest earnings call. <em>Bloomberg</em> first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-online-game-service-135340262.html">reported</a> about the project&#39;s existence back in July, and the company has shared details about it bit by bit since then. The publication said that <em>AC Infinity,</em> which is the project&#39;s name that could change upon release, will be a live online service similar to <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> that requires you to own the base game. According to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-says-assassins-creed-infinity-will-have-all-the-elements-fans-love-not-free-to-play/1100-6497505/"><em>Gamespot</em></a>, Guillemot also said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This game is going to have a lot of narrative elements in it. It&#39;s going to be very innovative game, but it will have what players already have in all the other Assassin&#39;s Creed games, all the elements that they love... right from the start. So it&#39;s going to be a huge game. But with lots of elements that already exist in the games that we published in the past.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Unlike other <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed</em> games with a single narrative story, <em>Infinity</em> will reportedly have multiple settings that will feel and look different from each other but will still be connected in some way. That means <em>Infinity</em> could have several games in one package, though how that will resonate with long-time fans remains to be seen. The original <em>Bloomberg</em> report also called it a massive online platform with room to expand in the months and years after its launch, so we may see new content hit the service as campaigns or seasons.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ubisoft pooled its resources and unified the Montreal and Quebec teams, which previously worked on separate<em> Assassin&#39;s Creed</em> titles, to develop <em>Infinity</em>. Guillemot said it&#39;s still in its very early stages, however, and previous reports <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-confirmed-rumored-to-launch-2024-at-the-soonest-with-multiple-settings/1100-6493645/">said</a> its soonest possible release won&#39;t be until 2024.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-infinity-wont-be-free-to-play-124546762.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">61a4042c-4d10-4bf7-bcd6-9823b8e382fa</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 12:45:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635508902</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T12:01:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1dcaaba0-38aa-11ec-aff2-3855ba047112" width="5303" height="3535" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1dcaaba0-38aa-11ec-aff2-3855ba047112" width="5303" height="3535" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JHVEPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Montreal, QC, Canada - September 6, 2021: Ubisoft Montreal sign at their headquarters in Montreal, QC, Canada.

It&#39;s based on the <a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/01/29/canon-reveals-price-and-more-details-for-its-ai-camera-the-powershot-pick/">PowerShot Pick</a>, an experimental, crowdfunded camera that was released only in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>The PowerShot PX has pan-and-tilt functionality (340 degrees horizontally and 110 degrees vertically) and a 19-57mm (35mm equivalent) focal length range. The idea is that you you can place it a strategic spot, like on a table during a family picnic, for example. The camera can then scan the scene, find people&#39;s faces and automatically determine the best moment to capture a photo. &quot;The best photos aren&#39;t always the posed smiles.... the PowerShot PX captures a huge range of looks and precious reactions that you might not capture,&quot; Canon wrote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="17b00c934869405aa98e288011e02c39"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUqWnn8q7IY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>It can frame subjects &quot;intelligently to capture natural expressions and reactions,&quot; Canon says. You can also prioritize specific faces, like if it&#39;s someone&#39;s birthday. In theory, that would allow you to enjoy a gathering without the need to break away and take photos, knowing that it will be done automatically. You can also grab photos manually via an app or voice control.&nbsp;</p><p>Following an event, you can use the PowerShot PX&#39;s iOS or Android apps to get recommendations on the best photos to keep. Those are then stored on a memory card, where they can be uploaded to a computer. It supports WiFi and Bluetooth for smartphone connections, so you can control images with no need to check the device, Canon said. It can also double as a webcam via Canon&#39;s webcam utility app. (It runs on batteries with charging via USB-C.)</p><p>The PowerShot PX is coming to Europe and the UK in November 2021 for £500/€500 (around $585). There&#39;s no word yet on a release to North America or elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canon-powershot-px-is-smart-home-camera-for-family-moments-121547584.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc3767a6-a6b7-4a8c-a7e4-1dc4cad4dd5b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 12:15:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635508696</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T11:58:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7fa677c0-38a8-11ec-8daf-aff78100355a" width="1344" height="858" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7fa677c0-38a8-11ec-8daf-aff78100355a" width="1344" height="858" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Canon's PowerShot PX captures candid images and video autonomously]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Canon's PowerShot PX captures candid images and video autonomously]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[What even is the metaverse?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For most of this year, Facebook has been talking about its plans for the metaverse, pledging to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2021-earnings-young-adults-metaverse-220703590.html">lose a lot of money</a> in order to bolster its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-150-million-vr-learning-fund-171537678.html">ambitions</a> in the space. Yesterday, the company announced that it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">rebrand its corporate identity to “Meta</a>” in order to double down on this commitment. (And, you know, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-papers-release-120713316.html">other reason</a>.) The metaverse, as Meta describes it, “is a new phase of interconnected virtual experiences using technologies like virtual and augmented reality.” Given the number of companies who are now starting to talk about the metaverse in very real terms, we have to answer one, very obvious question: What the Hell is a metaverse?</p><p>Everything that follows is, to a certain extent, meant to be read with the right number of ahs, ahems, polite coughs and other caveats. After all, a number of companies have started using the term in order to bask in the reflected glory thrown out by the metaverse hype train. Much like “Web 2.0,” “The metaverse” has a loosey-goosey definition that is being used to define whatever is coming next for the internet. A virtual world that mirrors our own? Metaverse. A way to buy and sell NFTs of Elon Musk dressed as a dog? Metaverse. A new way of creating commerce and communications? Metaverse. It’s likely that when we look back at the metaverse a decade or two from now, should it actually happen, it’ll look vastly different to what its boosters predict.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In his <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/founders-letter/">Founders Letter</a>, CEO Mark Zuckerberg describes the metaverse as “an embodied internet where you’re in the experience, not just looking at it.” He goes on to talk about how “in this future, you will be able to teleport instantly as a hologram to be at the office without a commute, at a concert with friends, or in your parents’ living room to catch up.” And then cites the benefits of that, including a reduced carbon footprint and less time stuck in traffic.</p><p>The easiest and most obvious point of comparison is the metaverse as represented in pop culture. Neal Stephenson’s <em>Snow Crash</em> (where the term originates), Ernest Cline’s <em>Ready Player One</em> and the Wachowskis’ <em>The Matrix</em> are all examples of this virtual, digital-world-that-actually-mirrors-our-own. Those with (long) internet memories will recall projects like <em>Second Life</em>, which promised to do this sort of thing 18 years ago. And some folks have suggested that <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>, which are both games and virtual spaces where <em>stuff other than games</em> takes place, are forms of metaverse.</p><div id="c741e431be2b48be858f8f9b5dec6d44"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cSp1dM2Vj48?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Meta’s interest is clear as a way of building out its work in the virtual space through its acquisition of Oculus. Sir Nick Clegg, who after his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/election-2017-40212223">political defenestration</a> and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-42514116">inexplicable Knighting</a> became <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-19-facebook-hires-tarnished-uk-politician-to-fix-its-reputation.html">Facebook’s vice president of Global Affairs and Communications in 2018</a>, wrote that the metaverse is designed to create a “greater sense of ‘virtual presence.’” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/oct/20/facebook-plans-to-change-its-name-as-part-of-company-rebrand-report"><em>The Guardian</em></a> reported that Clegg claims to use Meta’s virtual presence service, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">Horizon Workrooms</a>, to take his “Monday morning meetings in the metaverse with a virtual table and whiteboard.” You may be thinking, then, that the metaverse will be little more than Zoom but with a requirement to spend more to own some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-project-cambria-vr-headset-181249160.html">pricey VR gear</a>.</p><p>Alexandru Voica, Meta’s Technology Communications Manager in Europe, says that a better way to understand the metaverse is as “the next evolution of the internet.” He used the video call we were on as an example of something that the metaverse could hopefully improve. “We’re meeting in this 2D video call, and it’s great compared to a phone call but it’s not as good as if we were sitting together [in the real world],” he said, “The idea is, how can you take this interaction and get it as close to you and I being together [in a public space].” He added that the metaverse wasn’t envisioned as supplanting real-world connections, but to make virtual experiences more lifelike.</p><p>Voica added that these virtual engagements will feel a lot more real with the use of technologies like VR, AR and spatial audio. When you have a series of boxes on a Zoom screen, for instance, it’s harder for your brain to process all of that information at once. In the virtual world, with people’s audio directed toward you from wherever their avatar is sitting, it’s easier for you to engage.</p><p>Some of this feeds back to Mark Zuckerberg’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-09-a-closer-look-at-mark-zuckerberg-s-next-decade-manifesto.html">‘Next Decade’ manifesto</a> from the start of 2020, where improvements in AR and VR technology will better empower remote work. Obviously that was before COVID-19 made remote work a necessity for millions of people, and before it became one of the defining <a href="https://ez.substack.com/p/the-upcoming-remote-work-company">culture-war non-issues this year</a>.</p><p>Another common frame of reference is Matthew Ball’s essay on <a href="https://www.matthewball.vc/all/themetaverse">what a metaverse is</a> from January 2020. At the time, he said that any metaverse would be a persistent and synchronous virtual environment with its own economy. Ball added that the metaverse would enable “would-be laborers” to “participate in the ‘high value’ economy via virtual labor.” He cited the practice of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-12-13-the-soapbox-on-gold-farming-and-the-grind.html">Gold Farming</a> — where players of a large MMO in a low-wage country works for hours to earn large amounts of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/animal-crossing-video-game-sales-diablo-ii-virtual-economies-131547613.html">virtual currency (or goods)</a> which they then sell on to other players for real-world cash — as a current example of this “virtual labor.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2d981a00-e5bb-11eb-befe-4b032683a356" style="height:4916;width:7371;" alt="SUN VALLEY, IDAHO - JULY 08: CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg walks to lunch following a session at the Allen &amp; Company Sun Valley Conference on July 08, 2021 in Sun Valley, Idaho. After a year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the world&#x002019;s most wealthy and powerful businesspeople from the media, finance, and technology worlds will converge at the Sun Valley Resort for the exclusive week-long conference.

To be honest, the idea that games publishers would agree to the free-sharing of their intellectual property, with all the lost profits that would entail, is the most unbelievable idea in the document.</p><p>But even Epic Games’ CEO Tim Sweeney is open to the idea of some cross-communication in some form or another. This July, Sweeney told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/style/metaverse-virtual-worlds.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> that said a “tunnel” could exist between, in this example, the virtual worlds of <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em>. What’s not clear, however, is what a user could take from one end of that tunnel to the other beyond their own, custom-designed avatar.</p><p>Voica says that this cross-sharing of IP will be vital to ensuring the success of the metaverse. He used the example of a user buying a designer jacket, as a digital item which could be worn by their avatar as they went about their day. That item doesn’t have any value if you’re only able to wear it in the specific designer’s own virtual world. “It would be like buying a Manchester United shirt and only being able to wear it inside Manchester United’s stadium,” he said. And he believes that consumers wouldn’t buy into a system with such a limitation, saying that “people don’t want to be locked in.”</p><p>There’s also a line of thinking that a metaverse will actually describe the unification of the digital and real worlds. AR glasses that overlay a rich data set onto the street as you go about your day, outsourcing tasks from your own brain. That will, naturally, require smart glasses with transparent displays capable of actually reproducing this data in a useful manner. Not to mention a quantum leap in computer vision, data processing and battery life to make it viable for whole-day use. This, of course, will also require a dramatic shift in how we view privacy in public and private spaces a decade on from the privacy objections raised when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-30-google-glass-review.html">Google Glass</a> was briefly en vogue.</p><p>This September, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/09/28/epic-fortnite-metaverse-facebook/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> interviewed Sima Sistani, the co-founder of Houseparty who now works for Epic Games. They said that the metaverse would be the thing that replaces Social Media to suck away all of our free time. Sistani believes that, unlike now, where people simply create images and post status updates, the next generation will enjoy collaborative experiences with one another. And that the next generation of content creators will create fresh experiences for the rest of us to enjoy, once we’ve paid for them.</p><p>One of the things that is kinda/sorta clear, at least from the metaverse’s boosters, is that the platform won’t be owned by a single person or company. Instead, it will — hopefully — operate much like the internet does now, with multiple providers offering infrastructure to build a cohesive whole. Or at least, that’s the theory, and there’s the additional hope that decentralized technologies will help reduce the potential for a single arbiter to rule over this new frontier.</p><p>Projects like <a href="https://decentraland.org/">Decentraland</a>, its own virtual environment, are already working on this principle, with its economy running on Ethereum’s blockchain. As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/style/metaverse-virtual-worlds.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported earlier this year, Decentraland’s market has already seen real-world brokers buying up parcels of virtual real estate. And there are already art shows and casinos in operation inside Decentraland, all of which can be tied to some form of digital commerce. This is sadly at-odds with the potential for a post-scarcity digital utopia that a metaverse could theoretically foster.</p><div id="d83ddd5b3bab49abbfc58fa296512add"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Snap CEO Evan Spiegel speaks with WSJ’s <a href="https://twitter.com/JoannaStern?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JoannaStern</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WSJTechLive?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#WSJTechLive</a><a href="https://t.co/n88FkIT5Bx">https://t.co/n88FkIT5Bx</a></p>— The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) <a href="https://twitter.com/WSJ/status/1450569845578379272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2021</a></blockquote></div><div id="eee1a30dbf4c4d6a8e108a37efa1cb30"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NARRATOR<br><br>He was. <a href="https://t.co/U4XnXCmeeG">https://t.co/U4XnXCmeeG</a></p>— jack⚡️ (@jack) <a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1450667602703904768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Pop-culture descriptions of metaverses commonly present them less as a social good and more as a symptom of impending collapse. Even the reference onanism that is <em>Ready Player One </em>shows a world that has slid into economic, social and environmental decline. When asked about the metaverse, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel cited <em>Snow Crash’s</em> “virtual world created by an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-10-instagram-added-snapchat-features-at-zuckerberg-request.html">evil monopolist</a>.” Not long after, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey agreed that Neal Stephenson’s novel was intended as a warning, rather than a guide. [An aside, in <em>Snow Crash</em>, poor users accessing the metaverse through a public terminal are rendered in monochrome, and are derided by the wider society as a consequence — something that was replicated in the real-world by <em>Fortnite</em> players who bullied “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/5/7/18534431/fortnite-rare-default-skins-bullying-harassment">Default</a>” players who didn’t buy custom skins for their avatars.]</p><p>Now, Meta believes enough in the metaverse that it’s hoisted its flag, and fortune, to the idea for the next few years. And it’s hard to think that, however convenient, its metaversal ambitions are a smokescreen for the very real issues the platform is currently facing. Titles like <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> provide a vague sense of how a persistent, universal online world could hold the attention of users for thousands of hours, but those are for now curated experiences. And projects like Decentraland offer a hint as to how a virtual economy would function, but nothing yet gives us a cohesive grand narrative of the metaverse which can show us where it’s going. In many ways, companies like Meta are trying to put together this jigsaw without much of an idea of what it’s going to look like when it’s finished.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c183a396-2047-4496-b70f-baf5fb46a3e2</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 12:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635508366</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T11:53:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/04771db0-38a4-11ec-abf6-3a6976df5081" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/04771db0-38a4-11ec-abf6-3a6976df5081" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Meta / Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oh, it's Second Life with higher-res graphics.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The Metaverse]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Facebook is now called Meta]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While Facebook the social network is still Facebook, the overarching company that it created is now called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">Meta</a>.

Similarly, the Oculus App will be called Meta Quest App. According to Bosworth, the intention is &quot;to make clear&quot; to consumers Quest is a Meta product. &quot;We all have a strong attachment to the Oculus brand, and this was a very difficult decision to make,&quot; Bosworth said. The name is trickling down to other physical products.

Its latest release is no different, but that doesn’t make it any less exciting. It has announced an ITX PC case it’s calling the <a href="https://teenage.engineering/products/computer-1">Computer-1</a>. The company says it has been working on the design since 2014. “It’s not a ground-breaking PC case, but we like it, and use it every day,” TE says on its website. “Now we’d like to share it with you.”</p><p>The case is made from 1mm-thick powder-coated aluminum. Like TE’s recent synths, it comes in a build-it-yourself flat-pack design that involves bending some of the panels. “Think twice, bend once,” the company warns humorously. With chrome handles included, the case stands 322mm or about a foot tall. Width-wise, it measures 170mm or just over six inches wide. Inside, you have enough room for an SFX power supply, a dual-slot GPU that measures under 180mm long and a CPU cooler that’s about 120mm tall. It will be interesting to see what thermal performance is like on the Computer-1 since the side panels don’t feature a mesh design.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At $195, the Computer-1 is pricey, but about what you would expect to pay for an ITX case from a small company. You’ll find more affordable options in products like the <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/cases/mini-itx/masterbox-nr200/">NR200</a> from Cooler Master, but you can easily spend as much as $200 or more on a <a href="https://www.dan-cases.com/dana4.php">Dan A4</a> or FormD T1. If you’re interested in the Computer-1, you may have to wait to get your hands on one. It’s currently sold out, but you can sign up to get a notification once it is available.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineering-itx-case-computer-1-214556959.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c4f9f26c-e00a-4525-800c-7b68faaf26cd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 21:45:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635456064</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T21:21:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/94236d40-3833-11ec-9aff-92d93fb45e19" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/94236d40-3833-11ec-9aff-92d93fb45e19" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Teenage Engineering]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Computer-1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Computer-1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon will spend billions of dollars to offset holiday shipping slowdown]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While Amazon had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-q1-2021-210221698.html"><ins>huge revenue surge</ins></a> over the past year thanks to lockdown and the resulting rise of online shopping, the company’s <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf">recent earnings report</a> shows that it might be slowing.

The company <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/">just reported its results</a> for the quarter ending on September 30th, and Apple made 29 percent more revenue than a year ago — that&#39;s $83.4 billion, for those keeping track.</p><p>As usual, the iPhone led the way. iPhone sales made up almost 47 percent of Apple&#39;s total revenue, and iPhone revenue of $38.9 billion was up 47 percent year over year. But it&#39;s worth remembering that last year, the iPhone 12 series was delayed and didn&#39;t go on sale until October (or November, in the case of the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max). This year, all four iPhone 13 models went on sale simultaneously, in mid-September. While that&#39;s only a few weeks of the quarter, it likely helped fuel that massive growth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The iPad, too, had a strong quarter. While revenue of $8.25 billion makes it the smallest of Apple&#39;s five main product categories (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Services, and &quot;Wearables, Home, and Accessories&quot;) the iPad category grew 21 percent year over year. The Mac, on the other hand, was flat — revenue of $9.2 billion was only up two percent — but that was just enough for Apple to say it was a new all-time high for the Mac.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple&#39;s Services business has been growing steadily for years, so it&#39;s not surprising that this quarter&#39;s revenue of $18.3 billion was an all-time high, as well. But for the Mac, it&#39;s interesting to see it hit that high-water mark without <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">new MacBook Pro models</a> on the market to help move the needle. Now that the new MacBook Pro has been released, it&#39;ll be worth seeing how it affects Mac revenue overall next quarter.</p><p>The wearables, home, and accessories group also grew in strong but not spectacular fashion (up 12 percent). But just like with the Mac, next quarter could be huge for that segment — the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">third-generation AirPods</a> just went on sale and it&#39;s easy to imagine those products making a big impact.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, Apple is holding a call with investors at 5PM ET, and we&#39;ll be listening in to see if CEO Tim Cook has anything of note to share this quarter.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-q3-2021-earnings-financial-results-205158698.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ded55f6e-7909-4b1d-bb0d-d2f63c669f0c</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 20:51:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635454565</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T20:56:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/36816c80-3830-11ec-b77f-21eb4c39fec8" width="2000" height="1279" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/36816c80-3830-11ec-b77f-21eb4c39fec8" width="2000" height="1279" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mac revenue hit an all-time high last quarter, even without new MacBook Pros]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercedes cars will have optional Dolby Atmos audio starting in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t have to buy a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-dolby-atmos-160018074.html">Lucid Air</a> if you want a car with more immersive Dolby Atmos.

You won&#39;t need a Facebook account to use its Quest headsets.

When CEO Mark Zuckerberg first shared the news during the company&#39;s Connect event, it wasn&#39;t clear how broadly it planned to adopt the name across its product portfolio. But now we have a much better idea thanks to a Facebook post from incoming CTO <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491">Andrew &quot;Boz&quot; Bosworth</a>. For one, Meta is retiring the Oculus brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Beginning in early 2022, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Oculus Quest</a> will instead be known as the Meta Quest. Similarly, the Oculus App will be called Meta Quest App moving forward. According to Bosworth, the intention is &quot;to make clear&quot; to consumers Quest is a Meta product. &quot;We all have a strong attachment to the Oculus brand, and this was a very difficult decision to make,&quot; Bosworth said. &quot;While we’re retiring the name, I can assure you that the original Oculus vision remains deeply embedded in how Meta will continue to drive mass adoption for VR today.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of the rebranding, Meta is also backpedaling on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-facebook-login-account-policy-backlash-160034955.html">unpopular decision</a> to require <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-facebook-account-policy-192552362.html">Facebook logins</a> to use Oculus headsets. Bosworth said the company is working on new ways to allow people to log into the platform, and that will roll out sometime next year. &quot;This is one of our highest priority areas of work internally,&quot; he added. Additionally, the name will filter to other products, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-portals-go-170004952.html">Facebook Portal</a>.

Facebook Inc. is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">changing the name</a> in order to distinguish its beleaguered social network, which has an increasingly poor reputation around the globe, from the company that is pinning <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2021-earnings-young-adults-metaverse-220703590.html">its future</a> on the promise of a “metaverse.”</p><p>&quot;Our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can&#39;t possibly represent everything that we&#39;re doing today, let alone in the future,&quot; Zuckerberg said. &quot;From now on, we&#39;re going to be metaverse-first, not Facebook first.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zuckerberg announced the new name during a virtual (meta-virtual?) keynote for the company’s Connect event. Under its new arrangement, Facebook and its “family of apps” will be a division of the larger Meta company, which will still be led my Zuckerberg.</p><p>The restructuring bears some similarities to when Google restructured itself <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-02-google-alphabet-restructuring.html">into Alphabet</a>, the holding company that now operates Google, along with its “other bets” like DeepMind and Nest. Facebook previously said it plans to separate Facebook Reality Labs, its AR and VR group, from the rest of the company when reporting its financial performance. In a new statement it added that its&quot;corporate structure&quot; won&#39;t be changing. The company is also changing its stock ticker from FB to MVRS beginning <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/facebook-new-name-meta">in December</a>.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3a1c0f80-381c-11ec-afef-3151daef5589" alt="Facebook is now Meta." data-uuid="43ed939f-d36a-3825-b085-d01aec6c8d30"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p></p><p>The company is positioning the name as more reflective of its future ambitions to evolve from social network to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reportedly-changing-name-042958266.html">metaverse company</a>. Zuckerberg is still defining exactly what being a “metaverse company” means for its main platform and users, but augmented and virtual reality is central to the vision.  The company has already shown off an early version of one project, called Horizon Workrooms, that allows people to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">conduct meetings</a> in VR. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-connect-metaverse-zuckerberg-171507437.html">also previewed</a> new &quot;Horizon Home&quot; and &quot;Horizon Venues&quot; experiences. (All of the company&#39;s social VR products will fall under the larger &quot;Meta Horizon&quot; brand, according to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491">a post</a> from incoming CTO Andrew Bosworth.) And, earlier this month, the company announced plans <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-europe-jobs-metaverse-220103694.html">to hire</a> 10,000 new workers in Europe in order to build out its metaverse.</p><p>The name change also comes at one of the most precarious moments in the company’s history. The social network is reeling from the fallout of the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-papers-release-120713316.html"> “Facebook Papers,”</a> a trove of internal documents collected by a former employee turned whistleblower. The documents have been the basis for a series of complaints to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the source of more than a dozen reports about the company’s failings to stem the tide of misinformation, hate speech and other harms caused by the platform.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a431d180-3820-11ec-b5bb-0f49daf10fed" alt="The thumb is no more." data-uuid="95ba7d67-dffc-3004-be7b-4a65644c105b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>The new name also means that the iconic Facebook &quot;thumbs up&quot; will no longer be the company&#39;s official logo or on the signage at its headquarters. (Incidentally, the role of &quot;likes&quot; and other reactions in enabling hate and anger on Facebook has been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/technology/facebook-like-share-buttons.html">central narrative</a> of the Facebook Papers disclosures.) In a <a href="https://design.facebook.com/stories/designing-our-new-company-brand-meta/">blog post</a> about the design of the new name and logo, the company said the new logo was optimized for 3D experiences and &quot;designed to be experienced from different perspectives and interacted with.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that the new name doesn&#39;t change anything for the main Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp services, which will be known by their existing names. But the services could get more metaverse-oriented experiences with time. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1453795920278003715">said</a> that users could expect &quot;a more immersive Instagram experience in the metaverse.&quot; Bosworth also notes that some &quot;relevant products and services&quot; would be rebranded as well, such as the Portal lineup, which will eventually take on &quot;Meta Portal&quot; branding. The company also plans to &quot;retire&quot; the Oculus name, with the VR products taking on the Meta identity.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23b4053e-9791-4c4a-bbd8-086deafe9473</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 18:21:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635448426</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T19:13:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a3250eb0-381b-11ec-b8f1-ca2d404105f9" width="1554" height="863" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a3250eb0-381b-11ec-b8f1-ca2d404105f9" width="1554" height="863" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[fb meta]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[fb meta]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
