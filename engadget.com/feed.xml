The two art forms helped people through lockdowns, so it makes sense for tech and media gatekeepers to maintain that momentum as life slowly returns to normal. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-partial-downloads-launch-android-130054347.html">Netflix</a> did just that by allowing subscribers to watch partially downloaded shows and movies. Now, Google is <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/07/updates-from-google-for-games-developer.html">doing the same</a> for mobile games. The latest version of Android will allow you to fire up a game long before it completes downloading.</p><p>According to Google, you&#39;ll eventually be able to start playing Play store titles in seconds. More specifically, it says that games will be ready to open at least two times faster than before. One example shows a 127mb game being fit to play with just 20 percent downloaded. For now, developers can sign up to a beta for the feature, but Google says it will eventually become the default system for Play Store games.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tech giant has tried to tear down some of the barriers around digital gaming in the past. Notably, it launched<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-19-google-play-instant-games-demo.html"> Instant Games</a> in 2018 that loaded up ahead of the full installation process. While its Apple Arcade rival, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-26-google-play-pass-37-apps.html">Play Pass</a>, allows subscribers to try a library of apps for a monthly fee. Then there&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-173003693.html">Stadia</a>, Google&#39;s promising (but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-studios-closure-173055505.html">troubled</a>) cloud gaming service that does away with game downloads.</p><p>More broadly, the play-as-you-download feature comes at an opportune time. Like their console and PC brethren, mobile games are increasing in size. A trend players may have spotted with the release of open-world and metaverse games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/genshin-impact-sony-playstation-5-spring-170642072.html"><em>Genshin Impact </em></a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Roblox"><em>Roblox</em></a> on iOS and Android. Research from <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/news/average-mobile-game-file-size-increased-76-over-last-five-years/">Sensor Tower</a> shows that the average file size of mobile games increased by 76 percent in the US since 2016. Helping players get to the action faster in the face of larger downloads is therefore a win-win for developers and the public alike.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-games-download-115553510.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">775f4fa9-6556-4f7f-b594-9204274f407d</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 11:55:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626176703</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T11:45:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/61c4cb60-e3cd-11eb-bfed-f504c16ce395" width="5000" height="3750" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/61c4cb60-e3cd-11eb-bfed-f504c16ce395" width="5000" height="3750" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2020/10/04: In this photo illustration a Genshin Impact app by miHoYo Limited logo is seen displayed on a smartphone.

That includes the foldable Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3, the Galaxy S21 FE, the Galaxy Watch 4,  Galaxy Watch 4 Classic smartwatches and the Galaxy Buds 2. The lineup suggests an aggressive push on its foldable devices, as Samsung remains the biggest phone maker dabbling in the new (still expensive) form factor. It’s still a key differentiator between the Galaxy family and pretty much every other phone series. This is especially true in the West, where foldables from Huawei, ZTE and Xiaomi and the rest don’t garner the same attention (or ad spend) as the Galaxy Fold.</p><p>Will Samsung offer a more competitively priced foldable? We don’t know just yet. The leaks share no prices and no launch dates, so Samsung will have something to reveal when Unpacked kicks off, which will, presumably, be very soon.</p><p></p><p>— Mat Smith</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/cryptofarm-ps-4-pro-raided-ukraine-045118233.html"><br>Cryptofarm with thousands of PS4 Pros raided in Ukraine</a></h2><h3>Caught because it stole electricity from the nation&#39;s grid.</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9dded1f0-e395-11eb-a3fe-b61df0dcd37a"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, has discovered and raided a cryptocurrency mining farm that allegedly stole electricity from the country&#39;s power grid.

The flight aboard the New Shepard will take Bezos, his brother Mark, aviation pioneer Wally Funk and three other passengers to Kármán line, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html">just beyond</a> the edge of space.&nbsp;</p><p>To get the certification, Blue Origin had to verify New Shepard&#39;s hardware and software operation during its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-new-shepard-ns-15-test-flight-060356586.html">NS-15 test flight</a> conducted on April 14th, 2021.

The prices for the different systems are also vastly different: Virgin Galactic&#39;s customers pay $250,000 for a ticket to the edge of space, Blue Origin space tourists are expected to pay around $500,000 and SpaceX clients will pay $55 million for a 10-day mission to the ISS.&nbsp;</p><p>However, a seat to fly with Jeff Bezos on the maiden Blue Horizon flight sold at auction for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-new-shepherd-seat-auction-winner-182036391.html">$28 million</a> to a buyer expected to be named soon. That&#39;s a lot for a flight expected to last about 10 minutes, but it should be quite a ride.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-gets-faa-clearance-for-its-first-human-flight-on-july-20th-105015875.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f412adb-7f71-46ac-9226-c9a62e6fad49</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 10:50:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626174497</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T11:08:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/90adbee0-e3ba-11eb-91ef-b7d405426c2b" width="4916" height="3277" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/90adbee0-e3ba-11eb-91ef-b7d405426c2b" width="4916" height="3277" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Isaiah Downing / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos addresses the media about the New Shepard rocket booster and Crew Capsule mockup at the 33rd Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colorado, United States April 5, 2017.

This latest deal marks an all-time low for Amazon and essentially cements their appeal.</p><p>If you missed them in 2019, the Elite 85h offer EQ and noise-cancellation presets within Jabra&#39;s Sound+ companion app that actually boost their audio profile. The headphones can automatically switch between these so-called &quot;Moments&quot; by analyzing noise to detect which location you&#39;re in. In addition, the software lets you choose between different voice assistants and helps you find your headphones if you lose them.</p><p>The Elite 85h also offer on-ear detection. When activated from the app, you can automatically answer calls or resume audio by putting them on. What&#39;s more, the headphones boast a heaving 36 hours of battery life with ANC on, topping Sony&#39;s 1000XM3 by six hours and Bose&#39;s QC35 II by an impressive 16 hours. Turn off noise-cancellation and you can up that to 41 hours between charges.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85h-headphones-deal-102504141.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">66035ab1-ea24-46a3-ae6a-1266168845e6</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 10:25:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626171860</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T10:24:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d990fb10-e3c2-11eb-a7fc-42679f4125b6" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d990fb10-e3c2-11eb-a7fc-42679f4125b6" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85h headphones]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85h headphones]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senate appoints former NSA official as head of US cybersecurity agency]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A former NSA and White House official has been appointed to lead the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) at a time when ransomware and other kinds of cyberattacks are on the rise.

Samsung is trying to attack that market with a specially-designed automotive sensor that uses some unique technology to adapt to both low and bright lighting situations, the company <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-its-first-isocell-image-sensor-tailored-for-automotive-applications">announced</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A touch smaller than sensors used on smartphones, the ISOCELL Auto 4AC offers 1,280 x 960 resolution but has a unique &quot;CornerPixel&quot; arrangement. Within a single pixel areas it uses both 1 micron and 3 micron photodiodes, with the latter used for capturing images in low light situations. Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-12-sonys-hdr-camera-helps-self-driving-cars-see-in-the-dark.html">Sony&#39;s HDR automotive sensor</a>, it can capture video at night while also adapting to fast-changing lighting situations like in tunnels.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1906ec20-e3b2-11eb-bb7e-aa32d89ef919" alt="Samsung&#39;s latest HDR camera chip is designed for automotive applications" data-uuid="d7390c72-8665-33a7-a809-c367235826b5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>&quot;With two photodiodes capturing images in different exposures simultaneously, the sensor offers up to 120dB HDR with minimal motion blur, allowing smoother transitions between dark and bright areas while preserving more details of the road ahead,&quot; according to Samsung. At the same time, it can mitigate flicker issues with LED lights over 90 hertz used in headlights, street lamps and other sources.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung is rumored to have won a $436 million dollar contract to supply &quot;the largest US EV maker&quot; with camera modules that would replace rearview mirrors, according to the <a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202107120014"><em>Korea Economic Daily</em></a>. That automaker is rumored to be Tesla and the vehicle may be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-2022-004217965.html">Cybertruck</a>, which has cameras in the front fenders rather than rearview mirrors, as <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/07/12/tesla-cybertruck-rumored-behind-camera-deal-samsung/"><em>Electrek</em></a> has noted. All that said, however, the new sensor launch may be unrelated and for now, cameras still can&#39;t legally replace side mirrors in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>As with other automotive-grade sensors, the ISOCELL Auto 4AC can withstand temperatures ranging from -40 to 125 degrees Celcius, and can be adapted to both human (mirrors, backup cameras etc.) and machine (self-driving) systems. The sensor is currently in production so it could appear in cars in the near future.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-hdr-camera-chip-automotive-applications-082447761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee159c06-270e-4f74-9083-8e62b016c6af</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jul 2021 08:24:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626165423</ingested><modified>2021-07-13T08:37:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fdd91560-e3aa-11eb-9fef-ca5daa805894" width="1000" height="617" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fdd91560-e3aa-11eb-9fef-ca5daa805894" width="1000" height="617" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung's latest HDR camera chip is designed for automotive applications]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung's latest HDR camera chip is designed for automotive applications]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tag Heuer made a Super Mario-themed smartwatch because why not]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your favorite video game plumber will soon be available on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">Wear OS watch</a>. Tag Heuer announced today that it&#39;s collaborating with Nintendo to make a <em>Super Mario</em> edition of its Connected smartwatch, featuring &quot;the intrepid, iconic hero&quot; in various watch faces and animations. It&#39;ll be available July 15th for $2,150, which is in line with how much the Connected series has cost in the past. One of the highlights here, though, is the company&#39;s use of Mario&#39;s appearances to encourage wearers to get active and reward them when they move.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Tag Heuer, Mario&#39;s &quot;upbeat and active personality will encourage wearers of this smartwatch to enjoy moving too.&quot; But it&#39;s not just about being inspired by simply seeing his face on your wrist. The watch&#39;s dial will become &quot;livelier and more animated the more the wearer is active.&quot; There&#39;s also a &quot;gamification rewards system&quot; at play. Mario will greet you with a salute each morning, and as you move about, you&#39;ll get different animations as you hit 25, 50, 75 and 100 percent of your steps target. These animations feature familiar items from the Mario universe, like the Super Mushroom, Pipe, Super Star and Goal Pole. The company says this idea was inspired by the notion of &quot;easter eggs,&quot; so I suppose you&#39;re supposed to treat these animations as such.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even when you&#39;re not being active, the Tag Heuer Connected Super Mario edition&#39;s interface will remind you of the character. You can choose from a selection of four new watch faces, and they don&#39;t just offer red-and-blue themes. The Timekeeping dial, for example, uses &quot;retro elements from the 1985 version of Super Mario Bros. with Mario, all in pixels.&quot; One of the designs features Mario&#39;s cap, while another takes elements of the game and puts them in a rotating animation.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cbe5a4a0-e347-11eb-9fef-3e317055ea60" alt="Five of the Tag Heuer Connected Limited Edition Super Mario watches with black-and-red straps.

Push buttons, crown logo and bezel graduation now come in Super Mario red, and you&#39;ll find symbols etched into the bezel that reflect the in-game objects you&#39;ll see when you hit your steps goals, too. A letter M is engraved on strap buckles and the crown, while the words &quot;TAG Heuer x Super Mario Limited Edition&quot; are also carved into the back of the watch. The company is also offering two interchangeable straps for the new watch: a black leather band on red rubber and a &quot;sporty alternative in matching red perforated rubber,&quot; as well as a travel case in — what else — Super Mario red.</p><p>Those hardware touches are pretty important since even though the Mario faces and skins will be available first on this limited edition of the Connected watch, Tag Heuer said it &quot;is also considering making it available on other editions of TAG Heuer Connected at a later stage.&quot;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="96716338-6e4f-463a-a8a2-cb38bbb5f085"/><p>Since this is a Wear OS device (Tag Heuer hasn&#39;t responded to Engadget&#39;s query on whether this is the existing OS or if it will update to the version co-engineered by Samsung and Google), the rest of the watch&#39;s functions will feel familiar. You can access Google Assistant, get your calendar and weather updates, along with Fit progress tracking on the watch. It&#39;ll also offer the company&#39;s own Sport, Golf and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag-heuer-unveils-a-wellness-app-for-its-connected-watch-102205216.html">Wellness</a> apps for better fitness tools.&nbsp;</p><p>The Super Mario version of Connected has a 45mm face and weighs 86 grams (0.18 pounds) with a rubber strap. It&#39;s water resistant up to 5ATM, and Tag Heuer promises its 430mAh battery can last a full day.&nbsp;</p><p>Tag Heuer is only making 2,000 of these watches, which will be available in selected boutiques and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:at its website" href="https://fave.co/2T5JdkF">at its website</a><a href="http://www.tagheuer.com/"></a>in some regions, from 15th July 2021.

But instead of finding computers, the agency found racks with thousands of PS4 Pros stacked vertically side-by-side. As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/thousands-of-ps4-pros-discovered-in-warehouse-raid-1847272415"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, the Ukrainian authorities confiscated over 5,000 gaming-related devices — 3,800 of which were consoles — from a warehouse right next to (and formerly owned by) the Vinnytsiaoblenergo energy distribution company.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s the largest cryptofarm the SBU has discovered so far, and the agency believes it&#39;s being operated by people living in the cities of Kyiv and Vinnytsia. Apparently, the operators used special electricity meters to prevent authorities from discovering the theft, which amounted to as much as US$257,000. &quot;At the same time,&quot; the SBU wrote in its announcement, &quot;the illegal withdrawal of electricity could lead to more global consequences — entire neighborhoods of Vinnytsia could be left without electricity.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vinnytsiaoblenergo denied any involvement in a statement sent to the <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/technology/security-service-uncovers-crypto-mining-farm-in-vinnytsia-allegedly-stealing-electricity.html"><em>Kyiv Post</em></a>: &quot;The equipment used for cryptocurrency mining has never operated on premises owned by our enterprise.&quot; It also said that it didn&#39;t find any evidence of electric theft and that the SBU&#39;s findings &quot;does not correspond to reality.&quot; While it&#39;s unclear at the moment whether the facility truly stole electricity or not, the SBU has published images of the  PS4 Pros it found at the warehouse, which you can see below.

With the discount, the Spin 713 is currently $619 instead of $699. The model that Best Buy is selling features an 11th-generation Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It also comes with plenty of ports, including two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 connections, a microSD slot, as well as HDMI and headphone jacks.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/doL5G3">Buy Acer Chromebook Spin 713 at Best Buy - $619</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Engadget gave the Spin 713 a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html"><ins>score of 85</ins></a> when we reviewed it last month. Part of what makes it stand out in the crowded Chrome OS market is that it features a display with a 3:2 aspect ratio. Most Chromebooks feature 16:9 displays, making them well-suited for watching video content but less than ideal if you need to do any work on them. The display on the Spin 713 is also bright and sharp with a pixel density of 200 pixels per inch. The taller screen also means you get a more generous trackpad than you’ll find on your average Chromebook. Combine that with a solid keyboard, a capable processor and just the right amount of RAM for Chrome OS and you have a device that’s solid. Aside from average battery life, one of the few complaints we had with the Spin 713 was the asking price. At $619, it&#39;s a better value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-best-buy-deal-221524448.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bea7f764-11f3-4e7c-a9a3-8f165d597ff2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 22:15:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626128127</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T22:15:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/28c55b10-cd37-11eb-9c7d-c457511f17df" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/28c55b10-cd37-11eb-9c7d-c457511f17df" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 713]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 713]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Verizon settles with Huawei over patent disagreement]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Huawei and Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) have settled their long-standing patent dispute.

While the US and other parts of the world have barred it from their national 5G networks, the Chinese company is ideally situated to make money on licensing fees. It has among the most 5G-related standards-relevant patents of any company in the world.

Style-conscious audiophiles will be able to order the LSPX-S3 glass sound speaker starting in August.</p><p>The Bluetooth-enabled device features an organic glass tweeter with three actuators that enable it to emit sound in all directions, <a href="https://www.sony.com/content/sony/en/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-electronics/2021/sony-electronics-introduces-new-lspxs3-glass-sound-speaker-creating-a-warm-and-inviting-atmosphere-in-any-space.html">according to Sony</a>. The company claims the tweeter &quot;produces clear and powerful high tones&quot; and spreads sound evenly throughout a space. The LSPX-S3 has a 46mm speaker unit and you can adjust the levels via the Sony Music Center app. It also has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ldac">LDAC</a> support for high-resolution audio.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3e0cf220-e340-11eb-bbff-91f768ac95b8" alt="Sony LSPX-S3 glass sound speaker " data-uuid="495cb2cc-70d3-3202-a77a-d87c7135cc0c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The speaker won&#39;t light up an entire room, but the flickering candlelight-style illumination should provide a cozy ambiance for nighttime reading. The LED can pulse in sync with music and there are several lighting modes and brightness levels.</p><p>You can take the LSPX-S3 outdoors, too. It weighs around 1.1kg and has a battery that Sony says can power the device for up to eight hours on a single charge. You can recharge it via the USB-C charging port.</p><p>There&#39;s also an option to link two units for stereo playback and it can form part of a multi-room audio system. In addition, the speaker has a built-in microphone for calls, a metal base and a fabric bottom.</p><p>Almost six years ago, Sony first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-02-sony-lamp-speaker-portable-projector.html">showed off</a> a prototype for the stylish product. The company <a href="https://japanese.engadget.com/jp-2019-06-06-lspx-s2.html">released</a> the LSPX-S2 in Japan in 2019 and brought it to the US the following year. The LSPX-S3 will cost <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/speakers/wireless-speakers/p/lspxs3">$350</a>/<a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/wireless-speakers/lspx-s3">£315</a>/<a href="https://www.sony.ie/electronics/wireless-speakers/lspx-s3">€350</a>, which is around $100 cheaper than the previous model.

When the company first introduced the format, anyone could view a Short. However, only those in about two dozen countries could access the tools YouTube created for filming and editing Shorts. With today’s announcement, the company is making those tools widely available, meaning you’re likely to see more and more of the clips appear on the platform.</p><p>YouTube’s embrace of short-form videos comes just as TikTok itself becomes a bit more like YouTube. At the start of July, the company, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-testing-3-minute-video-length-new-limit-155521258.html">following months of testing</a>, gave all of its users the ability to record clips up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-three-minute-videos-now-available-182016623.html">three minutes long</a>.

Rodnyansky told <a href="https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/apple-first-look-alexander-rodnyansky-1235017386/"><em><ins>Variety</ins></em></a> that the agreement makes Apple &quot;the very first of all the global streaming platforms to sign a strategic partnership with a company with Russian roots.&quot;</p><p>Rodnyansky&#39;s credits include <em>Cloud Atlas, Sin City: A Dame to Kill for</em> and <em>Machete Kills</em>, but he says it&#39;s his experience and production expertise in Russia that primarily led Apple to work with him. He produced Russian films <em>Leviathan</em> and <em>Beanpole,</em> which both won awards at the Cannes Film Festival and were Best Foreign Language Film Oscar nominees.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The deal with Apple is for several shows, some of which will be set inside Russia. The shows will be overseen by Russian writers and directors as well as international creatives.</p><p>Rodnyansky notes streaming has helped shows made in a variety of languages and countries to become international hits. “This is an amazing time when you have <em>Fauda</em> in Hebrew and Arabic doing really well across multiple territories, when you have French-speaking shows like <em>La Mante</em> or <em>Marianne</em>, or German shows like <em>Dark</em> or <em>Babylon Berlin</em> crossing borders,” Rodnyansky said. “This is a time for Russian-speaking shows to do the same, or multilingual shows.&quot;</p><p>Apple has similar first-look deals in place with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-kitbag-napoleon-movie-142125089.html">Ridley Scott</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-20-apple-first-look-deal-ron-howard.html">Ron Howard&#39;s</a> production companies, but the AR Content pact hints at its international ambitions. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a>, which has expanded to all but a few countries and territories, has found success in acquiring and making international content. Spanish crime drama <em>Money Heist</em> has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html"><ins>been a massive hit</ins></a>, while French thriller <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q4-2020-211411926.html"><em><ins>Lupin</ins></em></a> is Netflix&#39;s most successful original series so far this year. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spriggan-trailer-2022-release-date-231200486.html">Anime</a> and Korean dramas are also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/06/18/lupin-international-tv/"><ins>growing in popularity</ins></a> among subscribers. Earlier this year, Netflix <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/netflix-anna-k-leo-tolstoy-anna-karenina-first-russian-original-svetlana-khodchenkova-1234764255/">picked up</a> a modern-day adaptation of <em>Anna Karenina</em> as its first original drama series in Russian.</p><p>It&#39;s not too surprising that Apple is looking at a similar approach to content. Apple TV+ only has a few non-English-language projects available to stream, including <em>Tehran</em> and <em>Losing Alice</em>, so there&#39;s a lot of scope for Apple to expand its library with Russian and multilingual shows.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-russian-language-multilingual-shows-alexander-rodnyansky-ar-content-155904970.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a19c0eb-4d12-4597-b899-e5b77e5cf215</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:59:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626105549</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T15:59:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/68d77600-e328-11eb-bcfd-5f370f2bdacb" width="3500" height="2341" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/68d77600-e328-11eb-bcfd-5f370f2bdacb" width="3500" height="2341" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mario Anzuoni / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Producer Alexander Rodnyansky of the movie "Leviathan," nominated for an Academy Award for Foreign Language Film, poses for a portrait in Los Angeles, California February 3, 2015.

Virgin Galactic told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-has-a-ticket-to-space-too-with-richard-bransons-virgin-11626012705">statement</a> that Musk bought a ticket aboard the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html">air-launched rockets</a>. It&#39;s not certain just where the SpaceX founder is in the queue, but it&#39;s safe to say his ride will garner some attention.</p><p>The feeling is mutual. In an <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/richard-bransons-space-flight-is-about-to-win-the-billionaire-race-to-the-stars-3pw8zvfwh">interview</a> with the <em>Sunday Times</em>, Branson said Musk was a &quot;friend&quot; and suggested he might fly on a SpaceX ship &quot;one day.&quot; He even went so far as to <a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1414199651037716485">tweet</a> a photo showing him and Musk together.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Just don&#39;t expect that kind of warmth and camaraderie from Jeff Bezos. Blue Origin was more than a little eager to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html">trash-talk Virgin</a> ahead of its first fully crewed spaceflight, claiming that Branson and team were merely brushing the edge of space. While the company later wished Branson a &quot;great flight,&quot; we wouldn&#39;t expect Bezos and Branson to have heart-to-heart coffee chats any time soon.</p><p>It&#39;s not a complete shock that Branson and Musk would be so cozy. However well their personalities mesh, the two aren&#39;t quite direct competitors. Virgin Galactic is aimed primarily at space tourists content with suborbital flights, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-orbit-live-launch-stream-123903068.html">Virgin Orbit</a> is focused on launching satellites for outfits that can&#39;t justify expensive conventional rockets. SpaceX, meanwhile, has focused its tourism efforts on lunar flybys and usually carries costlier payloads into space. This isn&#39;t to say the two execs will start feuding if their businesses truly overlap — just don&#39;t count on the positive vibes lasting forever.</p><div id="590fcca69a3240fd8f4b317c0328c9f9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Big day ahead.

Verizon (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/verizon-media-sale-yahoo-apollo-funds-122155517.html">currently</a> Engadget&#39;s parent company) might have a solution. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-neighborhood-spoofing-scams">updating</a> its free Call Filter app with a &quot;Neighborhood Filter&quot; that blocks calls from numbers that share your area code and prefix.

A simple filter could lead to far fewer annoyances, not to mention greater trust in those calls that do come in.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/verizon-call-filter-neighborhood-spoofing-142918590.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0f8db3a2-3dc3-4fd9-8c8a-fb8ef18ca46d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:29:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626100160</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T14:29:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9115a580-e317-11eb-bfac-e5e6b7860112" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9115a580-e317-11eb-bfac-e5e6b7860112" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Verizon logo is seen displayed on a phone screen in this illustration photo taken in Poland on November 19, 2020.

Regulators have previously rattled their sabres at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-says-tiktok-bytedance-linkedin-misuing-dada-133448710.html">TikTok and LinkedIn</a> for alleged data collection violations. Just last week, authorities caused shockwaves by ordering ride-hailing giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-orders-didi-chuxing-app-removal-153419577.html">Didi to remove its app from mobile stores</a> in the wake of its US listing, causing its shares to initially plummet by 20 percent.</p><p>With US-China tensions still simmering, the decision will likely pile pressure on President Biden to increase scrutiny of Chinese businesses.

Whatever the reasons behind the latest price cut, the Buds Pro are still worthy of your cash due to their bombastic sound. Firstly, unlike the $150 Buds+, they boast active noise cancellation and a wider audio range that features more depth and clarity thanks to the internal 1mm woofer and a 6.5mm tweeter.&nbsp;</p><p>Voice calls have also been improved with the help of three microphones, an accelerometer and Wind Shield tech for when you&#39;re outdoors. What&#39;s more, battery life matches Samsung&#39;s estimates at five hours with ANC and Bixby turned on and eight hours with them off, or 28 hours total with the case — which supports wireless charging. For those looking for durability, the IPX7-rating means you can dunk them in up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes. Overall, they&#39;re still our highest rated Samsung earbuds with an exemplary review score of 85.&nbsp;</p><p>Just note that before you purchase them it may be worth familiarizing yourself with Woot&#39;s terms and conditions. For the uninitiated, the online retailer mainly offers limited-time deals with a modified return policy to its parent Amazon that includes numerous exceptions, including charges for shipping costs.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-all-time-low-122528401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cac21999-0026-4046-bf24-e44044e4b09b</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:25:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626089386</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T11:30:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/35316a10-e303-11eb-acee-8b317f57a73a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/35316a10-e303-11eb-acee-8b317f57a73a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Galaxy Buds Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Galaxy Buds Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[MIT robot could help people with limited mobility dress themselves]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Robots have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-30-mind-controlled-telepresence-robot.html">plenty of potential</a> to help people with limited mobility, including models that could help the infirm put on clothes. That&#39;s a particularly challenging task, however, that requires dexterity, safety and speed. Now, scientists at MIT CSAIL have developed an algorithm that strikes a balance by allowing for non-harmful impacts rather than not permitting any impacts at all as before.&nbsp;</p><p>Humans are hardwired to accommodate and adjust to other humans, but robots have to learn all that from scratch. For example, it&#39;s relatively easy for a person to help someone else dress, as we know instinctively where to hold the clothing item, how people can bend their arms, how cloth reacts and more. However, robots have to be programmed with all that information.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2aafa51cf73346e498eb0f7a1065b79d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9JrDMBg2HE?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In the past, algorithms have prevented robots from making any impact with humans at all in the interest of safety. However, that can lead to something called the &quot;freezing robot&quot; problem, where the robot essentially stops moving and can&#39;t accomplish the task it set out to do.&nbsp;</p><p>To get past that issue, an MIT CSAIL team led by PhD student Shen Li developed an algorithm that redefines robotic motion safety by allowing for &quot;safe impacts&quot; on top of collision avoidance. This lets the robot make non-harmful contact with a human to achieve its task, as long as its impact on the human is low.</p><p>&quot;Developing algorithms to prevent physical harm without unnecessarily impacting the task efficiency is a critical challenge,&quot; said Li. &quot;By allowing robots to make non-harmful impact with humans, our method can find efficient robot trajectories to dress the human with a safety guarantee.&quot;</p><p>For a simple dressing task, the system worked even if the person was doing other activities like checking a phone, as shown in the video above. It does that by combining multiple models for different situations, rather than relying on a single model as before. &quot;This multifaceted approach combines set theory, human-aware safety constraints, human motion prediction and feedback control for safe human-robot interaction,&quot; said Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s Zackory Erickson.</p><p>The research is still in the early stages, but the ideas could be used areas other than just dressing. &quot;This research could potentially be applied to a wide variety of assistive robotics scenarios, towards the ultimate goal of enabling robots to provide safer physical assistance to people with disabilities,&quot; Erickson said.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-csail-unveils-a-robot-that-helps-the-infirmed-dress-themselves-120016438.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">150237df-ad42-4411-9fee-574701281407</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626087445</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T10:57:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/85a7c910-e2f6-11eb-aeff-7248bac689f6" width="1800" height="1123" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/85a7c910-e2f6-11eb-aeff-7248bac689f6" width="1800" height="1123" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL unveils a robot that helps the infirmed dress themselves]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL unveils a robot that helps the infirmed dress themselves ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Finally, Virgin Galactic completes its first crewed spaceflight]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After oh so many delays, training up its founder, Sir Richard Branson, and some delightful, sometimes petty, banter with Blue Origin (love those “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html https://www.engadget.com/...">largest windows in space</a>” claims), Virgin Galactic has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html https://www.engadget.com/...">made it into space.</a></p><p>Or at least, it did, depending on who you ask.

Some apps, like Snapchat, make this harder to do or inform the user when screenshots are snapped. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-app-brings-disappearing-messages-to-i-os-users-080451402.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fifa-22-release-date-163029621.html">&#39;FIFA 22&#39; comes to next-gen consoles on October 1st</a></h2><h3>It&#39;s also coming to previous-gen systems, PC and Stadia.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fifa-22-release-date-163029621.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d4040370-e261-11eb-bebb-092887a1a12a" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Kylian Mbappe in &#39;FIFA 22&#39;" data-uuid="e8c0716a-1449-310a-9f9b-aa729b0124f5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">EA Sports</div></figure></a><p>While English fans might not want to think about football for a bit, <em>FIFA 22</em> is, predictably, on its way, and its centerpiece is a new HyperMotion system. This will apparently offer more realistic animation and gameplay when you game on a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S or Google Stadia. The technology uses machine learning to produce animations in real-time, leading to more &quot;organic&quot; movement.</p><p>The game is also coming to PS4, Xbox One and PC (via Origin and Steam), while <em>FIFA 22 Legacy Edition</em> is coming to the Nintendo Switch, although EA didn&#39;t outline differences.
