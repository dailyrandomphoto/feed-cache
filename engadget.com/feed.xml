While the company&#39;s website says it has over 4,800 cars operating in the UK capital, its recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/addison-lee-becomes-largest-london-taxi-firm-with-black-cab-buy?sref=10lNAhZ9">acquisition</a> of black taxi service ComCab will make it the largest taxi company in London with over 7,000 vehicles. It already has 650 zero-emission vehicles in its fleet after the acquisition, but to be able to fully <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/21/londons-largest-taxi-firm-to-go-fully-electric-by-2023-with-4000-evs/">switch over</a> to electric, it has teamed up with Volkswagen.</p><p>Addison Lee is investing £160 million ($218 million) to replace its existing fleet with slightly larger <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volkswagens-id-4-ev-is-the-basic-people-mover-youve-been-waiting-for-163027836.html">Volkswagen ID.4</a> vehicles. The standard ID.4 has a 77 kWh lithium-ion battery pack and has range of 250 miles, making it more suitable for city use than for long-distance driving. Its capable of 201 horsepower and 229 pound-feet of torque, with speeds reaching 100MPH.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The firm will start by rolling out 450 EVs by the end of 2021, presumably in addition to the 650 electric cars it already has. Then, the company plans to add 200 electric cars per month until its whole fleet has been replaced within a couple of years. The firm also plans to set up charging infrastructure for its drivers using the new £3.5 million (US$4 million) Future Mobility Fund it has established.</p><p>If the company succeeds in transitioning to electric by 2023, it&#39;ll be ahead of its competitors like Uber, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-08-uber-electric-hybrid-car-uk-targets.html">previously pledged</a> to replace its existing fleet with EVs by 2025. It also means up to 20,000 zero-emission trips each day in London, which will help the government achieve its goal of a net zero economy by 2050.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/addison-lee-fully-electric-2023-082000624.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">105c236b-0c4a-46b0-8db5-cce3df97361f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 08:20:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632298167</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T08:09:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commercial Vehicles]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ebb41450-1b6f-11ec-a3fe-eebdfc9f316f" width="1600" height="934" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ebb41450-1b6f-11ec-a3fe-eebdfc9f316f" width="1600" height="934" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Addison Lee]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Addison Lee]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Addison Lee]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Shareholders claim Facebook overpaid an FTC settlement to protect Zuckerberg]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook shareholders have filed a lawsuit alleging that board members overpaid on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-facebook-will-pay-5-billion-fine-for-cambridge-analytica-data-b.html">$5 billion FTC fine</a> to protect CEO Mark Zuckerberg from an individual lawsuit, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/21/facebook-paid-billions-extra-to-the-ftc-to-spare-zuckerberg-in-data-suit-shareholders-allege-513456"><em>Politico</em></a> has reported. &quot;Zuckerberg, Sandberg, and other Facebook directors agreed to authorize a multi-billion settlement with the FTC as an express quid pro quo to protect Zuckerberg from being named in the FTC’s complaint, made subject to personal liability, or even required to sit for a deposition,&quot; according to one of the two suits filed.</p><p>The two lawsuits, filed in a Delaware court last month, cite internal discussion among Facebook&#39;s board members.

In fact, as <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9633425/twitch-nmpa-music-publishers-agreement"><em>Billboard</em></a> points out, it&#39;s not a licensing deal at all. According to the publication, the Amazon-owned livestreaming service made a financial settlement for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/riaa-nmpa-letter-to-twitch-on-unlicensed-music-151703321.html">past usage</a> of licensed music on the platform. Twitch has also told creators in an email that it&#39;s putting together a new process that publishers and right holders can use to report content.&nbsp;</p><p>The new process is different from a DMCA and will start with a warning instead of a penalty. When a rights holder reports a stream, Twitch will issue a warning and remove the clips containing unauthorized music. In case of a flagrant violation — say, the rebroadcasting of concerts and the leak of unreleased tracks — then Twitch may issue a penalty outright, depending on the user&#39;s history.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its email, Twitch says the new process is more forgiving of users who may have inadvertently caught music they have no authority to use in their streams. Mike Futter of <a href="https://virtualeconcast.com/"><em>Virtual Economy Podcast</em></a> notes, though, that the new process just makes it easier for music publishers to flag users and that it doesn&#39;t make things better for creators. Streamers can&#39;t dispute a report if they&#39;re flagged for violation, since Twitch will just remove their videos. Even users who&#39;ve previously secured the rights to use a piece of music can get their content deleted if they&#39;re falsely flagged.</p><div id="8ba6e6e0590645918d3f909d83257f52"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Full text of the Twitch email (with alt text): <a href="https://t.co/S0xD9TDK1X">pic.twitter.com/S0xD9TDK1X</a></p>— Mike Futter (@Futterish) <a href="https://twitter.com/Futterish/status/1440390844020772864?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p><em>Billboard</em> says, however, that Twitch and the NMPA also agreed on a time window to hash out how music will be handled on the platform going forward. Twitch is reportedly offering NMPA members an opt-in deal allowing future collaborations. As for the new reporting process, the platform told creators that it has more information to share in the coming weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-deal-nmpa-044806416.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f842ebd2-72dd-46ef-910d-682e20627c08</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 04:48:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632286106</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T04:48:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/0f612e20-072a-11eb-8ebf-8c1f3d1cc752" width="4039" height="2693" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/0f612e20-072a-11eb-8ebf-8c1f3d1cc752" width="4039" height="2693" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Trutschel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - OCTOBER 11: In this photo illustration the logo of live streaming video platform Twitch is displayed on a smartphone on October 11, 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

Without much fanfare, the company has been quietly working on a free Oculus Quest game called <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/3632378823549307/"><em>Eden Unearthed</em></a>. Spotted by <a href="https://uploadvr.com/netflix-eden-unearthed-app-lab/"><em><ins>UploadVR</ins></em></a>, the game is available through the App Lab, which means it hasn’t gone through the full Oculus review process. The listing says the game was both developed and published by Netflix, but provides few other hints about its origins.</p><p>What we can say is that it was almost certainly envisioned as a tie-in for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-40-anime-titles-2021-074304890.html"><em><ins>Eden </ins></em><ins>anime series</ins></a> the company released back in May. What’s interesting here is that there are two separate versions of the app with different release dates listed. The v0.7 release came out on April 20th, while the v0.8 was released in August. That fact, along with the App Lab listing, would appear to suggest Netflix is still working on the game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the moment, it’s hard to say whether <em>Eden Unearthed </em>represents the kind of video game release we can expect from Netflix moving forward. In July, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html"><ins>hired former Oculus and EA executive Mike Verdu</ins></a> to help it build out a gaming team. At the time, <em>Bloomberg</em> reported the company’s plan was to offer games alongside its traditional video offerings within the next year.

Initially, the automaker plans to offer two different models of the luxury sedan called the EQS 450+ and EQS 580 4Matic.</p><p>Both will be available in three different trims: Premium, Exclusive and Pinnacle. The base model EQS 450+ costs $102,310, while its counterpart will set you back $119,110. The Exclusive models are priced at $105,710 and $122,510 respectively, while the Pinnacle variants cost $108,510 and $125,310. One thing to note is the above prices don’t include a $1,050 destination and delivery charge you have to pay separately.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="973239590c7f427a9730685d2e4d9547"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xwkDp-s4Y8w?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>To put that pricing in perspective, it means you can buy an EQS sedan for less than you would pay for an entry-level S-Class model from Mercedes. The S500 4Matic and S580, with destination charge included, start at $110,850 and $117,350.</p><p>Some of the highlights of the Premium trim include heated and ventilated front seats, leather upholstery and a 10-speaker sound system. Moving up to the more expensive trims, you can look forward to features like a head-up display, four-zone climate control, additional USB-C ports and more. No matter the trim, each EQS will also come with two years of complementary fast-charging at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/electrify-america-boost-plan-ev-network-141651830.html"><ins>Electrify America stations</ins></a> and 24-months of free maintenance.</p><p>One of the main reasons to go for the 580 rather than the 450+ is that it will come with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html"><ins>56-inch MBUX Hyperscreen</ins></a> the automaker unveiled at CES 2021.

The group also notes that Facebook didn’t provide specifics data it had asked for about how cross check works.</p><p>It’s not clear how much more information Facebook plans to share with the Oversight Board. The company declined to comment on the board’s statement.

The Treasury has <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0364">imposed</a> sanctions on the SUEX crypto exchange for allegedly &quot;facilitating&quot; ransomware attacks. SUEX reportedly helped launder the ill-gotten gains from at least eight ransomware variants, and is so in demand that over 40 percent of its known transactions come from &quot;illicit actors,&quot; according to the Department.</p><p>The move blocks SUEX&#39;s access to property (and interests in property) covered by US jurisdiction. The block also extends to any entity where the exchange owns a controlling stake, and prevents banks and people from making &quot;certain transactions.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Treasury stressed that it believed &quot;most&quot; cryptocurrency activity was legal, and that some exchanges merely fall victim to ransomware attackers.

Rather than trying to disrupt the overall cryptocurrency landscape, the US appears focused on individual exchanges and traders. This theoretically discourages others from handling ransomware payments while reassuring those who stick to above-board deals. Of course, there&#39;s only so much the government can do — less-than-reputable exchanges may simply look for partners the US can&#39;t touch.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-treasury-sanctions-suex-ransomware-172601658.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">79a7b1a9-4974-4576-9590-aae6d1396899</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:26:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632244510</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T17:15:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1eb2dca0-1af9-11ec-b75f-c1d4abddb77e" width="7360" height="4912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1eb2dca0-1af9-11ec-b75f-c1d4abddb77e" width="7360" height="4912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[mikkelwilliam via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Criminal hiding behind a mask turns up on computer screen asking the owner for money.

Researchers hope that analysis of data such as mobility, sleep patterns and how people type could spot behaviors associated with those conditions, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-wants-iphones-to-help-detect-depression-cognitive-decline-sources-say-11632216601?mod=djemalertNEWS"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>.</p><p>Other measurements could include facial expression analysis and heart and respiration rates. All of the processing would take place on the device, with no data sent to Apple servers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is working on research projects that could lead to the development of these features. The University of California, Los Angeles, is studying stress, anxiety and depression, with Apple Watch and iPhone data for 3,000 volunteers being tracked in a study that starts this year. A pilot phase that began in 2020 recorded data from 150 participants.</p><p>Researchers will compare data captured from iPhone and Watch sensors with questionnaires participants fill out about how they feel, according to the report. They&#39;re also said to be measuring the level of the stress hormone cortisol in participants&#39; hair follicles. Apple and UCLA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ucla-depression-study-225118236.html"><ins>announced the three-year study</ins></a> in August 2020.</p><p>Another research project is underway that may factor into this Apple project. The company and pharmaceutical firm Biogen <a href="https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biogen-launch-pioneering-study-develop-digital-biomarkers">said</a> in January they&#39;re working on a two-year study to monitor cognitive function and perhaps spot mild cognitive impairment, which has the potential to develop into Alzheimer’s. The plan is to track around 20,000 participants, around half of whom have high risk of cognitive impairment.</p><p>If data from the studies lines up with symptoms of depression or anxiety, Apple could use it to create a feature that warns users if it sees signs of a mental health condition. The iPhone could prompt users to seek care, which could be important as early detection can improve quality of life in the long run.</p><p>Apple and its partners are in the early stages of this work, so it&#39;ll likely be a few years at least before the company adds mental health monitoring features to the iPhone. There&#39;s no guarantee the research will lead to such features at all.</p><p>Some previous studies have indicated people with certain conditions use devices differently than other folks. It&#39;s not yet clear whether developers can build algorithms that can detect mental health conditions reliably and accurately.</p><p>Still, there&#39;s no smoke without fire. Health has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html"><ins>a growing focus</ins></a> for Apple over the past few years, so there&#39;s a chance features based on this research will eventually emerge.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mental-health-condition-detection-iphone-report-171343401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9cefbd62-f9f4-4e28-b943-73d54a49f3d1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:13:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632244425</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T17:13:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mental Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fea35d90-1afd-11ec-97f7-1b3a5b5e1ccb" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fea35d90-1afd-11ec-97f7-1b3a5b5e1ccb" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM details the motors that will power its electric Hummer and other EVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>General Motors has spent a lot of time recently talking up the capabilities of its upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html">Ultium battery technology</a> but has said significantly less so about the motors those cells will power.

With today’s announcement, the series consists of three different models: a 180 kW front-drive model, a 255 kW rear- and front-drive variant and a 62 kW all-wheel drive assist motor.

GM claims they will enable the vehicle to produce a combined 11,500 ft/lb of torque and accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in approximately three seconds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>GM says its engineers designed the motors with scalability in mind.

It’s no surprise, then, that the company is doubling down on the concept. Today, Facebook is announcing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:two new Portals" href="https://fave.co/2XEiZrZ">two new Portals</a>: an updated Portal+ for $349, plus a brand new $199 Portal Go that is also the company’s first-ever portable smart display.</p><p>Yes, in brief, that means the Go can actually be taken out of its charging dock and toted around. There’s also an integrated handle on the back for easy carrying. Despite the handle, it has a relatively compact form factor, with a 10-inch, 1,280 x 800 display housed inside a soft fabric-wrapped enclosure.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The idea behind this portable Portal, according to Facebook, is that you can keep the device in, say, a kitchen or an office, and it can then be moved around the house if the family is congregating in a different room. Of course, since it’s portable, it can also be brought outdoors as long as you have a relatively strong WiFi signal. Since it can stream music from sources like Spotify, you can also use the Go as a portable speaker.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/200ac590-1806-11ec-b7ff-f5dc57afcf76" alt="Portal Go" data-uuid="dcd3f13d-7af1-38ab-a1d1-e329022642e4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>As for battery life, Facebook says that you will likely get up to five hours of one-on-one Messenger calling on a single charge and up to 14 hours of music playback if the screen is off.</p><p>In addition, the company unveiled a new Portal+, which hasn’t been updated since the original debuted in 2018. While we thought the first-gen model was a bit of an eyesore, the new Portal+ brings a much-improved design. With a 14-inch, 2,140 x 1,440 display, it still has the largest screen out of all the Portals, but its footprint is much smaller than before. The Portal+ display can also be tilted up and down to accommodate different heights.</p><p>Both the new Portals have a 12-megapixel camera with an ultra-wide field of view. Like the other Portals, these make use of Facebook&#39;s so-named Smart Camera technology, which uses AI to follow you around the room, panning and zooming to keep you in frame the entire time. There’s also a smart sound tech that allows you speak at a normal volume, regardless of the distance between you and the device, and still have your callers hear you clearly.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, with any Facebook product, privacy and security are obvious concerns. To help allay those fears, both the new Portals have built-in camera lens covers, and there are buttons at the top that disconnects the camera and the microphone. The smart camera AI technology mentioned earlier runs locally on the device and not on Facebook’s servers. WhatsApp calls are end-to-end encrypted by default. On <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-e2ee-voice-video-calls-group-instagram-164140952.html">Messenger,</a> however, you’ll have to specify the contacts and groups you want to enable the end-to-end encryption (and even this feature is still in the roll-out phase).</p><p>Aside from new hardware, Facebook also detailed some incoming software updates. One of them is Household Mode, which essentially lets you share the Portal with the whole family. In Household Mode, you can allow access to a selection of shared apps and contacts, while keeping the rest personal. For example, then, you can let the whole family use apps like Messenger and WhatsApp, and allow them to call grandma and grandpa, but they won’t be able to contact anyone else unless you let them. You can set up a screen lock passcode to control access to the device as well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5d84fdf0-1806-11ec-bfed-68b238d81835" alt="Portal+ home screen" data-uuid="9686e760-e8dd-3756-a591-6f6d25a97339"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>The Portal home screen has also been redesigned to be more personalized, with a top row of favorite contacts, and a card interface similar to the one on other smart displays. There’s a card for Messenger Rooms, one for Spotify playlist shortcuts, another for most used apps, and more. As for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-facebook-portal-tv-review.html">Portal TV</a>, the company will soon be updating it so that you can see calling notifications like a pending Rooms invitation or a missed video call.</p><p>Additionally, Facebook has updated the Watch Together experience on Portal so it can be used not just on Portal-to-Portal calls, but also with Messenger pals on the phone, laptop or tablet. On top of that, the company says it’s bringing WhatsApp multi-device support to Portal in the next few months. This lets you use WhatsApp on your phone as well as four non-phone devices at the same time.</p><p>Facebook is aware that Portals can be used not just in the home context, but also for business purposes. That’s why it will be adding support for Microsoft Teams for all Portal devices starting this December. (It added support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-zoom-workplace-140020249.html">Zoom, WebEx, BlueJeans and GotoMeeting</a> last year.) There will also be a new Calendar app, which lets you view your Outlook or Google calendar on Portal. The beauty of this is that you could then jump in on your next meeting with a single tap on the screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bdc111e0-1806-11ec-af7e-1031e867704c" alt="Portal+ and Portal Go" data-uuid="938f8aef-5739-38ff-96e5-5bf89a89df7f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>In addition, Facebook is introducing Portal for Business specifically for small businesses to deploy and manage Portal devices. They can create and manage Facebook Work Accounts which lets employees use company email addresses to set up the Portal. IT admins can use a Portal Device Manager to manage the devices remotely.</p><p>According to Facebook, the 8-inch Portal Mini will be discontinued, but the Portal TV and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-15-facebook-portal-review-2019.html">2019 10-inch Portal that requires a power cord</a> will still be available.&nbsp;</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pre-orders" href="https://fave.co/2XEiZrZ">Pre-orders</a> for both the Portal Go and the new Portal+ start today.

Those who have been eager to get their hands on one of these VR headsets can now get two at one of the best prices we&#39;ve seen. Through September 27, Oculus is running a deal that <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:knocks $100 off a second Quest 2 headset" href="https://fave.co/3fdK4b4">knocks $100 off a second Quest 2 headset</a> when you buy one at full price. That means you can get two of the 128GB models for $500, or two of the 256GB versions for $700.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3fdK4b4" id="13154a36cdce481dba30170ff4d3c02c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Oculus;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Quest 2 bundle at Oculus - $500</a><p>Oculus improved its machine in nearly every way with the Quest 2, and the device ultimately earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">score of 89</a> from us. The headset itself is 10 percent smaller and more comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, although it does take a bit of fiddling to properly adjust its fit for your head. Powered by a Snapdragon XR2 processor, the Quest 2 includes fast-switching LCDs with a resolution of 1832x1920 per eye, and although it didn&#39;t launch with this, it will support 90Hz refresh rates. Its controllers are larger than before but still easy to hold, and they include a bit more space next to the gamepad buttons so you can rest your thumbs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The slight design changes and the better processor help make the Quest 2 an improvement on its predecessor in nearly every way. It excels at being both a standalone and a desktop headset, delivering more realistic VR experiences. It does have some limitations when it comes to standalone games, mostly due to its mobile hardware, but that&#39;s to be expected. Also, you must sign in with a Facebook account to use the Quest 2, which is also to be expect, but nevertheless a bummer for those who don&#39;t use the social network.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-buy-one-get-100-off-second-headset-deal-144032642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3fb4e3e-e174-490e-9223-3111b1504ef7</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 14:40:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632235125</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T14:38:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/1253d755-f82e-11ea-bbcd-685027325f42" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/1253d755-f82e-11ea-bbcd-685027325f42" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marvel shows are now available through Apple Podcasts subscriptions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel">Marvel</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/siriusxm">SiriusXM</a> have opened a new Apple Podcasts channel, which includes a paid tier.

Instead, the e-bike has become the preserve of those that can afford one. A decent conventional bike already costs a bit, so adding a motor understandably only adds to that cost. Enter <a href="https://tenways.com/">Tenways</a>, a new player in the e-bike world that’s trying to buck that trend. Its debut model, the CGO 600, is currently <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tenways-ebike-the-best-urban-ride-ever#/">available on Indiegogo</a> for around $1,400 and despite its relative affordability, it doesn’t scrimp on features.</p><p>Now, the usual disclaimer: With Indiegogo and other crowdfunding platforms, there’s always an inherent risk. But Tenways states its production is already underway and given that the review model they sent appears to be full and final hardware we were somewhat assured that things are ready to go.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The CGO 600 is clearly a city bike with its thinner tires and classic diamond frame. It’s powered by a 250W battery which is discreetly hidden in the downtube, to the point where it’s almost impossible to tell that this bike is electric at all. The rear hub motor is visible, but also small enough to not catch the eye. That motor offers a max assistance speed of 15mph in Europe or 20mph in the US which are the maximum allowed in those territories. The claimed range is around 80 miles per charge (though this seems optimistic) and it’s all bundled into a package that weighs around 15 kilograms (around 33 pounds).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4bd71050-1ad3-11ec-9ef3-666ec5dca701" alt="Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review." data-uuid="21ca3241-a96f-3be9-949b-dea398dab02a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Beyond the key specs, the motor uses a torque sensor for fast, smooth acceleration with three levels of assistance. The bike has no gears, so the motor acts as either regular assist or can be used <em>like </em>gears when going uphill. The brakes are hydraulic for easier maintenance and the carbon belt transmission should mean no oily fingers or pit stops to set it back in place. The CGO 600 can be fully charged in about 2.5 hours, and there’s a small LCD display that acts as an onboard trip computer and power button.</p><p>I won’t lie, the specs were pretty impressive at this price point, but what initially drew me to the CGO 600 was the understated design. While it looks great in all the five colorways, there’s something about the black and green model that looks stealthy. The fact that it doesn’t scream “e-bike” makes it feel less of a lure for thieves and just all round makes for an attractive object. In many ways it reminds me of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-03-cowboy-electric-bicycle-battery-review.html">the Cowboy</a> (€1,990 or roughly $2,198) but with a little less aggressively modern design.</p><p>Your first task will be putting the bike together, but it’s not too much of a challenge and I was all set and done in less than an hour with a tea break and work interruptions along the way. Once you have it together, you can download the companion app if you wish (it’s not essential unlike on the Cowboy) and get out there on the road.</p><p>There are two frame sizes on offer are 50cm (19 inch) and 54cm (21 inch) with no step-through option if that’s your preference or if the available sizes are too big for you. I’m a fairly average height and find the 50cm version I tested to be comfortable. The riding position is a little forward-leaning, but not in a way that bothered me.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6730b630-1ad3-11ec-bdd3-8d4f8595d557" alt="Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review." data-uuid="a4c28197-d248-39cf-9e2e-1d18aae16620"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The very first thing you’ll notice is both how fast to engage and how smooth the motor is. When at a standstill at stoplights, it only takes a fraction of a second for the assistance to kick in. It’s smooth enough that it’s not jarring but powerful enough for you to instantly feel the benefit. Once you’re up to speed, it sometimes feels like the assistance isn’t really helping as much, but you only have to turn it off and have the bike in manual mode for a few seconds before your thighs remind you you’re running on your own steam.</p><p>It’s when you’re going uphill that you’ll really feel the benefit. The torque sensor means that the amount of assistance immediately responds to the intensity of the ascent. I found that even on fairly steep inclines I didn’t need to get up off the saddle; just fire up the highest level of power and work the pedals.</p><p>The torque sensor is also magnetic rather than pressure-based, meaning you can happily ride the CGO 600 entirely on your own leg power without any resistance or burden from the motor. This is great if you’re worried about it being less useful if the battery runs out.</p><p>About that: Tenways’ claim of 80 miles of assistance per charge is hard to gauge. I certainly haven’t ridden 80 miles on it yet. But on one full charge I’ve covered just over 22 with 58-percent battery remaining. On a crude calculation, that means I am on track for about 45/50 miles on a single charge. That’s much less than the advertised 80, but I also really enjoy the full power assist, so if you only rode on level one, you’d likely eke more miles out of it. Either way, 50 miles or so would cover a 5-mile commute back and forth over a week without charging.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that there’s no throttle mode here. That’s fairly typical of e-bikes in this style, but in case you were hoping for it, now you know. That said, if you press and hold the down button on the odometer, the bike will creep along on its motor, but it’s only about three miles an hour, so more of a gentle start or a lane splitter’s tool than anything like a motorbike mode.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ae50df40-1ad3-11ec-8bfb-d7efe256accd" alt="Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review." data-uuid="697b105b-3158-3ca1-a42d-1431d6c648cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>In keeping with the stealthy looks, that motor makes nary a sound. It’s not <em>entirely</em> silent, but certainly you’re not going to hear it while riding around town. I love that the hub motor is barely visible and that the battery is so well hidden. Though, of course, that does mean there’s no option to buy spares/swap them out. But it also means you can breeze past serious cyclists on their racers while barely breaking a sweat and enjoy their curious glances as you do so.</p><p>One last comment on how it rides: It’s definitely not an off-road bike. That is fairly obvious from the design, but worth mentioning. The CGO 600 lives for asphalt. I took it over some less friendly terrains (potholes, gravel and a decked pathway) and while it handled it all fine, the suspension is pretty hard so you’ll feel every teeth-clattering bump.</p><p>The onboard computer is useful but simple. The default screen has everything you need to know at a glance (speed/battery/distance etc.). Then there are sub-screens that are accessible with a  tap for more detailed information like average speed and range. This is also where you can add some security via a passcode for the motor. This obviously doesn’t prevent someone stealing your bike, but it’s a small deterrent perhaps?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/def93b60-1ad3-11ec-b6df-8e9415cd8efd" alt="Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review." data-uuid="fd0d64fe-08b4-3a0e-8e6f-576eb909985c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>At only 15kg, the CGO 600 is definitely one of the lighter e-bikes in this style. Lighter than both the Cowboy (16kg) and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-04-vanmoof-electrified-s2-electric-bike-hands-on.html">VanMoof Electrified S2 </a>(19kg, $2,298). This makes it a more manageable option if you need to lug it up stairs or, like me, man-handle it into an elevator each time you want to head out. It also makes manual mode a little easier on the legs should you prefer to go on human power (or if the battery runs out).</p><p>On a more practical note, Tenways included an integrated front light that&#39;s bright enough for those darker sections of your nighttime city commute. How it fares in more rural settings is likely a different matter. There’s also a rear light included, but it’s an accessory you attach with its own battery, so something you’ll need to check regularly if you don’t want to get caught out.</p><p>The humble city e-bike has evolved greatly in the last few years, but still needs a little push to bring it into the mainstream as a viable commuting option. Companies like Cowboy, VanMoof and Brompton have been chipping away at the remaining resistance points and now Tenways is here to show you can take most of the features from those models and package them in a more pocket-friendly way. The $1,400 price will likely go up once the Indiegogo campaign ends, but expect it to remain competitive even at retail prices.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tenways-cgo600-preview-143051234.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b50d19e5-b0d9-46ff-a6e0-db59a796a67d</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 14:30:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632234030</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T14:20:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c1bd8480-1ad2-11ec-a9fd-116250cc3ec9" width="1905" height="1179" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c1bd8480-1ad2-11ec-a9fd-116250cc3ec9" width="1905" height="1179" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tumblr’s Post+ subscriptions are available to anyone in the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tumblr is opening its paid subscription features to more users. Post+, the subscription offering it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-paid-subscriptions-post-plus-automattic-164124106.html"><ins>introduced</ins></a> in July, is moving into an open beta, the company announced. Until now, only a handful of creators had access to Post+, but with the next phase of the rollout, any US-based blogger can start experimenting with subscription-backed content (Tumblr says it plans to make Post+ available in more countries later this year). For now, Post+ allows bloggers to offer subscriptions at $2, $4, $6 or $10 a month, though creators can continue to offer a mix of free content as well.</p><p>With the update, Tumblr is joining an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html"><ins>increasingly crowded</ins></a> field of companies hoping to lure users with the promise of subscription revenue. But the company is hoping it can carve out a niche among younger users eager to experiment with the kind of creative — and often <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahmarder/ridiculously-weird-tumblr-posts"><ins>deeply weird</ins></a> — content the blogging platform has long been known for.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“This is not reserved for professionals,” Tumblr’s Head of Product, Lance Willet, tells Engadget. “On other places — [when] I think of either Patreon or Substack, you gotta kind of start with your content and then go out and find people. We are flipping that around and saying: you already kind of have a niche, why not just start asking for people to become a supporter.”</p><p>What’s less clear is if the Tumblr user base will be willing to start paying for content they used to get for free. Just hours after the company first announced plans for Post+ in July, the company posted a message to its <a href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/657366672276176896/tumblr-earlier-today-we-announced-to-the-press"><ins>staff blog</ins></a> decrying the “targeted harassment and threats” creators were facing over their participation in the initial Post+ beta. But Willet says the company has also seen a large amount of interest from users who want to try the tools out. Post+, he says, is for anyone with a niche on Tumblr, from Gen Z “meme lords and shitposters,” to artists and podcasters and bloggers. “People can have five followers, or 15 or 500 — it doesn’t matter.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-post-plus-expansion-140056311.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f15fc265-4f70-4ad2-838c-5d61f8aac3fd</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 14:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632181150</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T23:39:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a166d7d0-1a6a-11ec-b3e7-4e158f9f351c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a166d7d0-1a6a-11ec-b3e7-4e158f9f351c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tumblr]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tumblr's monetizations features are open to all in the US.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[tumblr Post+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Comcast makes its affordable broadband available to low-income undergrads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Comcast has expanded <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-08-06-comcasts-internet-essentials-offers-10-internet-access-to-low.html">Internet Essentials&#39;</a> coverage to include <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell">Federal Pell Grant</a> recipients within areas where it&#39;s available.

That ecosystem just became much more affordable if you have a computer, however. <a href="https://www.akaipro.com/press">The company</a> has introduced an MPC Studio controller built solely to tie in with MPC 2 software on your Mac or PC. Plug it in and you can produce tunes with the signature 16 drum pads (with pressure, velocity and aftertouch control) as well as an assignable touch strip that lets you twist instruments and synths. A color LCD helps keep your focus on the controller when you&#39;re chopping samples or fine-tuning effects.</p><p>The software, unsurprisingly, plays a key role. Akai has been pouring much more of its energy into its MPC 2 software, including a <a href="https://www.gearnews.com/akai-mpc-2-10-massive-update-adds-14-plug-ins-and-pitch-correction-to-desktop-and-hardware/">large update</a> in July that added AIR plugins and on-device pitch correction. You&#39;ll have access to eight plugin instrument engines as well as sampling, MIDI sequencing, arranging and other parts of the MPC workflow. Think of the MPC Studio as Akai&#39;s answer to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-24-ableton-push-review.html">Ableton&#39;s Push</a> — it&#39;s hardware that brings out the software&#39;s full potential.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The MPC Studio is available today for $269. MPC 2 is thankfully included, so it&#39;s a relative bargain so long as you have a production-ready computer. This could make Akai&#39;s universe considerably more accessible if you&#39;re new to this kind of music making.</p><p><strong>Update 9/21 6:10PM ET:</strong> Akai now says MPC 2 is included, not separate as we originally wrote. We&#39;ve updated the piece accordingly. Needless to say, that makes the MPC Studio a sweeter deal for newcomers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-studio-controller-140007968.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">88ea3177-419e-4d42-95cb-4b90db93b155</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 14:00:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632262358</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T22:12:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5701da00-1ad8-11ec-bfbc-43382c7df4ac" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5701da00-1ad8-11ec-bfbc-43382c7df4ac" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Akai]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Akai MPC Studio controller linked to a MacBook Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Akai MPC Studio controller linked to a MacBook Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
