It starts at RMB 328,000 (about $51,450), or well under the roughly $70,000 of the ET7, but offers similarly grandiose range figures. Nio claims the base 75kWh battery offers over 341 miles of range using China&#39;s test cycle, while the highest-end 150kWh &quot;Ultralong Range&quot; pack is supposedly good for more than 620 miles. You&#39;ll likely pay significantly more for the privilege and may not see that range in real life, but the numbers could still tempt you away from higher-end Model 3s if long-distance driving is crucial.</p><p>You can expect the usual heapings of technology. The ET5 will have built-in support for autonomous driving features as they&#39;re approved, and drivers get a &quot;digital cockpit&quot; thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-us-verizon-140017764.html">Nreal</a>-developed augmented reality glasses that can project a virtual screen equivalent to 201 inches at a 20-foot viewing distance.

That&#39;s a long way off, but Nio appears to be on track with its EV plans as it expects to deliver the ET7 on time (if only just) starting March 28th.</p><p>This launch also dovetails with Nio&#39;s tentative steps outside of China. The brand only expanded to Norway in 2021, but it aimed to begin sales in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden in 2022. You should see the badge in 25 countries and regions by 2025. While Nio still won&#39;t count as automotive heavyweight by that stage, it could easily put pressure on other EV makers within a few years.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nio-et5-ev-190702131.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ba0272c7-e02c-40a6-9b5b-53327d2417c0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 19:07:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639854425</ingested><modified>2021-12-18T19:07:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c47225e0-602e-11ec-bfeb-6df5188a862b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c47225e0-602e-11ec-bfeb-6df5188a862b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nio]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nio ET5 EV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nio ET5 EV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Toyota cars don't include remote starting on key fobs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Current Toyota drivers might not be thrilled about having to subscribe <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-key-fob-remote-start-function-requires-subscription-111606852.html">just to remotely start</a> from their key fobs, but what about new buyers?

The automaker told <em>Roadshow</em> in a <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/toyota-remote-start-digital-pay-subscription/">statement</a> that remote starting won&#39;t be available on key fobs for new vehicles.

This week, we’ve got a new addition to the <em>Halo </em>series with <em>Halo: Infinite, </em>which Jessica Conditt says fits right in with the rest of the franchise. Terrence O’Brien played the Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster and reported that the hybrid instrument produces convincing acoustic sounds that echo the original guitar. James Trew used the Analogue Pocket and says it’s the best handheld retro experience available right now, period. And Billy Steele listened to Yahama’s YH-L700A, which he deemed a bit heavy-handed, albeit excellent for movie watching.</p><h2>The Yamaha YH-L700A headphones have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-yh-l700a-review-130056716.html">a unique aesthetic and a high price</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a73df20-592e-11ec-8375-2a72806c444d" alt="Yamaha YH-L700A review" data-uuid="a74a6e50-f9ad-3c8b-95a6-9bffa0a47b49"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Billy Steele likes the look of the <a href="https://amzn.to/3F6mW96">Yamaha YH-L700A</a> headphones: he says the combination of leather, fabric, matte black and silver accents makes for a refined look while the square fold-in ear cups make them easy to travel with. The noteworthy feature on these headphones is the 3D Sound Field feature, which consists of seven presets to enhance music and movies. There’s also a head-tracking feature which makes the sound appear to be coming from a stationary point.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Billy says this last feature added a cinematic element to movie watching, but he didn’t think it translated when listening to music. The seven presets of the 3D Sound Field likewise worked better for movies and television where they created a spacious sound. While testing the filters with music, Billy reports they felt  heavy-handed and didn’t work well across genres. He says the active noise cancellation on these cans is sufficient if not impressive, and points out that the marquee features can be toggled on and off within the app. However, he was disappointed with the battery life – during testing, the headphones managed to last just under 11 hours, which is lackluster when most of the competition boasts closer to 30 hours of battery life. And at $500, they have a high price tag to boot.</p><h2>The Analogue Pocket offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011.html">all the fun of ‘90s portable gaming</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5fc6b9e0-5f7e-11ec-bccb-885439fe0e1d" alt="Analogue Pocket" data-uuid="ecd007be-d945-3497-90d7-0621f0a9cee2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew/Engadget</div></figure><p>James Trew is a long-time vintage gaming fan and is quick to point out that while the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a> is the best experience available right now, it’s also not for casual users. At $220, it lets you play most vintage portable titles from Game Boy, as well as Game Gear, while adapters for Neo Geo Pocket Color and Atari Lynx are on the way. It also has more modern touches, too, like a backlit display. And in addition to being a quality gaming device, the Analogue Pocket can also hook up to a TV and has built-in music making software.</p><p>Because of its FPGA “cores,” the Pocket can mimic vintage consoles at a hardware level – no more emulator quirks to suffer through. It’s also functional with original Game Boy accessories like the Game Boy Camera, printers or rumble packs. And it can connect to an authentic Game Boy for a multiplayer experience. James liked the 3.5-inch screen made with Gorilla Glass as well as the save states, but wished the shoulder buttons were better and said some of the display modes obscure on-screen messaging at times. Overall, the Analogue Pocket offers elevated retro gameplay with enough forthcoming additional features to ensure it will get better over time.</p><h2><em>Halo: Infinite </em>has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-review-campaign-xbox-microsoft-080158610.html">fun new mechanics and tools</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8e4d2060-5f7e-11ec-8625-35a59187b28e" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="ffbcc3f9-0632-3493-80a5-cfc635241b40"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Jessica Conditt had high hopes for <a href="https://amzn.to/3sgVF0k"><em>Halo: Infinite</em></a><em>, </em>the first open-world game in the franchise’s history. And she admits that playing the new storyline brought back warm, gleeful feelings and a sense of familiarity. However, she also thinks the game lacks surprise and intrigue – much of the innovation into vertical space has been done by other, more recent games, and the cramped map made for contained and linear gameplay.</p><p>That being said, Jessica reports she had a lot of fun playing with the newly available mechanics and tools, in particular the grapple hook. From climbing mountains to scaling buildings, the grapple hook provides new vertical space for players to explore. Jessica says that while she expected a lot more from the pioneer FPS title, she also thinks it’s at its best when it gives users a rich environment full of grappling, shielding and in-air headshots. From the maze-like levels, military stereotypes and sarcastic robots, <em>Infinite </em>plays like a classic Halo game.</p><h2>The Hydrasynth Explorer offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hydrasynth-explorer-review-wavetable-synthesis-183026724.html">an endless array of synth options</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c5da5160-5f7e-11ec-af4f-5fa3df46f039" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="5e6b7073-336d-3036-be27-904697348370"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien admits up front that the <a href="https://fave.co/3GPVgG7">Hydrasynth Explorer</a> offers a remarkable array of features and options in a portable, well-built device. For $600, you get a wavemorphing engine with an eight-note polyphone, three oscillators per voice, a ring modulator, a noise source and over 200 waveforms. There are also two filters which can be in series or parallel to determine how much of each oscillator goes to each filter. He says that the 88-page manual feels like it’s just skimming the surface of what the synth is capable of.</p><p>However, you don’t need to master the sound design tools to get started with the instrument – just dig into the 640 presets spread over five banks of 128 patches. During testing, Terrence found the Explorer easy to use thanks to the neatly labeled sections on the front panel. A few things missing on the versatile device are a proper sequencer, full-sized keys, and touch strips instead of pitch and mod wheels. There are also only three filter knobs instead of five. Despite that, Terrence still feels that the Explorer is well worth its price tag given its great sound, solid build and plethora of tools to explore.</p><h2>Fender’s Acoustasonic Player Telecaster is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fender-acoustasonic-player-telecaster-hybrid-guitar-hands-on-183045383.html">an (almost) perfect couch guitar</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f7a4bf50-5f7e-11ec-8ffd-c0f7b9b11aad" alt="Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster" data-uuid="bd87987e-c5b9-3ff0-bde3-4660d3b7cf47"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien also spent some time with the new <a href="https://fave.co/323YExL">Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster</a>, which slashes $800 off the price of the previous model. For $1,200, you get a mahogany and spruce satin finish with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups and a three-way switch with six sound options. Instead of a rechargeable battery, the Player runs on a standard nine-volt cell. Terrence reports it eats through the batteries surprisingly quickly, but remains convenient.</p><p>When it came to how the instrument sounded, Terrence reports that while there are fewer acoustic simulations on this model, the two offerings (Rosewood Dreadnought and Mahogany Small Body) cover a lot of ground. He says that he prefers the electric sounds of the Telecaster to the more expensive <a href="https://fave.co/32arOvl">Jazzmaster</a>, as it resembles the original guitar more and plays better with pedals. Terrence says the two acoustic simulations offer depth and character, and that overall, the hybrid guitar is a perfect couch instrument.</p><h2>Universal’s Audio Volt is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-audio-volt-2-volt-276-review-audio-interface-home-studio-170050385.html">an audio interface ideal for a home studio</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/27d4b720-5f7f-11ec-bbef-3371e2aa6829" alt="Universal Audio Volt" data-uuid="a4a21376-8a82-3c72-ac4a-0969366eb12c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien deems Universal Audio’s first foray into the budget space a success. The company’s <a href="https://fave.co/3q3MTQt">Volt series</a>, five models that run from $139 to $369, are affordable audio interfaces that share a core 24-bit/192kHz audio converter and a preamp with a “Vintage” mode that aims to recreate that classic tube preamp sounds. Terrence tested the $189 Volt 2 and the $299 Volt 276, which are both two-input interfaces.</p><p>The differences between the two models are slight: the Volt 2 is simple and utilitarian, but works well with limited space, while the “76” version has a built-in compressor and will require extra desk space as most of the controls are on the top. Terrence says the compressor makes a big difference as it’s capable of softer edges to tame the harsher frequencies. He also felt the metering LEDs on the 276 were easier to see and the wooden sides were a nice touch. While the base models were excellent interfaces at reasonable prices, Terrence said the 176, 276 and 476 stood out from the pack thanks to their compressors, style and ergonomics.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-listen-to-yamahas-latest-headphones-with-3d-sound-170015087.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60360933-ebcd-452d-881b-41b2e81f5631</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 17:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639783892</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T23:31:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/054c3080-5f7e-11ec-bbcb-78afb82f2968" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/054c3080-5f7e-11ec-bbcb-78afb82f2968" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ICYMI: We listen to Yamaha’s latest headphones with 3D sound]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adidas' first NFT drop earns $23 million]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Adidas&#39; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adidas-metaverse-nft-teaser-173817023.html">first NFT effort</a> appears to have been a success. <em>The Block</em> has <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/128003/adidas-originals-nets-23-million-after-closing-its-first-nft-drop">learned</a> the collaboration with Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gmoney and Punks has raked in more than $23 million in Ethereum between a $15.5 million &quot;Early Access&quot; phase and $7.5 million in a general sale.

In the excerpt below, Rose takes a look at two companies leveraging computer vision and generative adversarial networks to reimagine existing properties as 21st century electrified smart homes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cfae0f40-59e0-11ec-9ddf-0394f646accf" alt="Supersight front cover" data-uuid="801f2f9c-a224-3d9f-8e5f-db9fb4165b6d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BenBella Books</div></figure><p><em>Excerpted with permission from </em><a href="https://www.supersight.world/">SuperSight: What Augmented Reality Means for Our Lives, Our Work, and the Way We Imagine the Future</a><em> by David Rose, published by BenBella Books.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>We should all be using solar panels. Period. The average cost for a sustainable energy system has fallen about 70% in the last decade, from $5.86/watt to $1.50/ watt, so it’s a financial no-brainer. For no money down, you can finance an installation and start saving a hundred dollars a month in the first month, and even more if you live in the sun-saturated South.</p><p>So why aren’t we? It’s complicated! Math, logistics, taxes, and aesthetics all play a role. Many homeowners fear it will make their houses shiny and reflective like the Tin Man from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. The process of figuring out the number of panels in what size you need requires learning to “talk solar” in unfamiliar units like kilowatt-hours. And change always comes with risk, whether actual or just perceived.</p><p>The pro-climate mission of Boston-based company Energy Sage is to get people to electrify their homes. That means solar panels on your roof, an electric car, a home battery system, automatic blinds, and a smart thermostat that precools or preheats as you drive home. And they’ve partnered with us at Continuum to get potential customers more comfortable with the idea by showing them what an electrified version of their home might look like. Using publicly available Google Home satellite images, we size solar panels, digitally overlay them on clients’ roofs, and then show them what their pad would look like from both the street and their neighbor’s fence. We then take those images and pair them with data from Project Sunroof, a Google project that helps you work out the solar savings potential of your roof. Once you’ve seen the beautiful pictures of your electrified home and realized how much you’re going to save over the years—and you have the visual and financial data in hand—it’s a simple decision to go forward and make that change.</p><p>Other home improvement projects will benefit from a similar SuperSight-envisioned approach. Let’s consider landscaping: another complicated, potentially expensive project with its own disorienting language, risks, and desperate need for pre-project visualization.</p><p>I met landscape designer Julie Moir-Messervy at an MIT pitch competition and was immediately intrigued with her mission: to give homeowners the confidence and tools they need to change their barren yard into a collection of outdoor living spaces. Her company, HomeOutside, helps people see new possibilities for their backyards using AI and computer vision. Once they’ve visualized their yard in a compelling way, the company makes it easy for them to make that vision a reality by hiring the landscape installer, getting materials delivered, and even helping spread the payments out over time.</p><p>Landscaping isn’t just good for property values; greenscapes filter airborne pollutants that trigger asthma, help people recuperate faster from illness, reduce summer temperatures, and even lower crime. Proper native landscaping powers a dynamic system that helps out the bees and birds, who in turn pollinate trees and reseed plants. Southwest shade trees can reduce the need for air-conditioning, and northeast hedges cut down on winter winds—and heating bills. More trees mean more carbon capture—a ton over the lifetime of each tree—as they literally suck the bad stuff we produce out of the air while reducing runoff and erosion.</p><p>But “most people don’t do anything in their yards because they don’t know where to start,” Julie told me. “They don’t know which plants to select and how to arrange them, or don’t know how to install a landscape design and care for it over time.” I was so inspired to work on the problem that I accepted a position on her board and got to work.</p><p>HomeOutside is training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to automatically compose beautiful and sustainable landscape designs, based on the thousands of designs (think of these as recipes) the firm has developed for clients over the last twenty-plus years. The company uses Google Earth Engine and photogrammetry to start with a 3D view of any address (US only, currently). The GAN architecture then uses one network (the Generator) to make a new design, and another network (the Discriminator) to judge or score the work. These two networks continue their iterative game, generating then scoring, until the discriminator judges that the landscape has a good composition: shade trees, natural pollinators, grass for playing, hardscapes/decks and furniture for gathering places, plant diversity, and so forth.</p><p>Companies that sell plants, furniture, lighting, and hardscapes are obviously interested in this type of “imagination engine” technology, because it bridges the conceptual gap between the current state of someone’s garden and what could be—thus motivating many more people to make the dream real. It’s not just great for the homeowners and outdoor retailers, either—it’s great for the environment, too. But what the company’s environmentally focused investors find  most captivating about this project is the opportunity to change the landscape of entire neighborhoods at scale. <em>What if we could create a new national park across millions of backyards that stitch together places for birds and bees? </em>Every acre of forest absorbs about 2.5 tons of carbon a year. What if we turned neighborhoods into significant carbon sequestration zones?</p><p>I helped Julie and her team develop HomeOutside’s grand plan to proactively redesign seventy million front yards, then work with Home Depot, Lowe’s, Wayfair, IKEA, and garden centers to email their customers a 3D redesign of their yard. Customers simply go outside their home, open their phone, and,through the app’s use of spatial world anchors, walk through an immersive animated landscape superimposed on their current yard. A time-lapse view from sunrise to sunset shows why the edible garden is placed where it is. The winter visualization explains the choice of new fir trees between their yard and the neighbor’s. Spring flowers bloom with a cacophony of color.</p><p>Will people be alarmed by the idea of an algorithm proactively redesigning their yard, with new shade trees and naturally pollinating shrubs? It’s not as if your front yard is private now, thanks to Google Street View. And if you are selling your home, you might decide against hiring the landscapers and just choose to post images of HomeOutside’s makeover version instead to maximize your curb appeal.</p><p>Once this visioning technology is commonplace, lots of different fields will start taking advantage of it. Home Depot, for example, recently invested in a startup called Hover, which, after digitizing your home in 3D, visualizes and prices new paint, siding, and roofing materials. SuperSight will soon show the actual paint crew up on their ladders, finishing the last few brush strokes, so you get that delightful experience of a job just finished. Volkswagen might put a new Passat in your driveway, complete with the kayaks and mountain bikes it knows you love on top. And the company trying to sell you home and car insurance? They’ll project a disaster scenario: solar panels fallen off, the shade tree hit by lightning, and your new Passat pummeled in a hail storm. Better buy the insurance before you repaint.</p><p>How will we interact with these types of immersive designs? With our SuperSight glasses on, will we point and place trees, or paint flowers from a palette of choices, like a 3D version of Photoshop? Will we select each plant from a vast menu of options for infinite control and customization, or will we just tell the system what we like so it learns our preferences, then proposes a single solution we’ll love? I believe in the happy medium: that we’ll largely prefer to see several “expertly composed” options and choose from among them, much as we do today when working with an architect, interior designer, or wedding planner.</p><p>Experts are usually so good at what they do that it’s often a mistake to over-specify particular details. For example, you shouldn’t tell an architect that you want a window exactly here, or an interior designer that you want this particular chair in a specific color in this corner. Instead, you express your opinions at a higher level of abstraction (“I want the room to feel more connected to the environment”) or through describing a required function (“We want a vegetable garden”), and let them do the detailed work.</p><p>The same expert-guided interaction model will dominate our relationships with SuperSight AIs. For landscaping, we might ask for a more formal French garden with rectilinear layouts and exotic colorful plants, or a curvaceous organic design that prioritizes privacy from our neighbors. We might indicate a preference for an open space for play, or for a filled-in scheme with more space for a productive garden. And as we express these higher-level interests, our 3D landscape design will dynamically recalculate to match our preferences. With SuperSight glasses on, we’ll be able to test our hunches faster by seeing reconfigurations immediately and in context, superimposed on our real home.</p><p>The jury is still out on whether HomeOutside will be able to use this technology to convince millions of homeowners to invest significantly in a sustainable landscape. The testing is promising, though; customers are delighted to see their yards reimagined and restaged. In the next five years, HomeOutside plans to use Google Earth and street view imagery in a generative AI tool to automatically redesign tens of millions of landscapes, with sustainable plants, shade trees, natural pollinators, and bird-friendly berries. If it succeeds, it will mean a million homeowners will plant at least 3 million new shade trees, like oaks and beeches, that will each capture 48 pounds of carbon a year as they mature. That’s 14 billion tons of carbon sequestered over those trees’ lifespans.</p><p>As one of the HomeOutside advisors summed up, “You are building the equivalent of a new national park—the National Park of us! Visualization tools like HomeOutside can persuade homeowners to reshape the American landscape.”</p><p>That’s the ultimate potential power of SuperSight: to help people envision and imagine a future that benefits themselves and the planet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-supersight-david-rose-ben-bella-books-163045081.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2e7cbadb-9440-4076-88a6-d797b95a8b56</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 16:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639166192</ingested><modified>2021-12-10T19:56:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Lawn & Garden]]></category><category><![CDATA[Home & Garden]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c42fd330-597f-11ec-a9bf-8d8073b32711" width="5000" height="3227" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c42fd330-597f-11ec-a9bf-8d8073b32711" width="5000" height="3227" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[sl-f via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Country house with solar panels on the roof and a terrace and swimming pool.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Modern house with solar panels on the roof and electric vehicle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NVIDIA's RTX 2050 laptop GPU slaps an old name on new technology]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NVIDIA is once again <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-revives-the-gtx-1050-ti-in-the-face-of-gpu-shortages-113533736.html">reviving an old name</a> in its graphics chip lineup, but this time it&#39;s for thoroughly modern technology. As <em>AnandTech</em><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17124/nvidia-announces-geforce-rtx-2050-mx570-and-mx550-for-laptops-2022s-entry-level-geforce">reports</a>, the company has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-laptop-new-options/">introduced</a> an GeForce RTX 2050 laptop GPU that may sound like recycled low-end hardware, but is based on the same Ampere design found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-ray-tracing-affordable-gaming-laptops-110058581.html">RTX 3050 series</a>. The naming scheme is confusing, to put it mildly, but that does give you up-to-date ray tracing in a potentially more affordable package.</p><p>You&#39;ll have to settle for a 64-bit memory bus instead of the 3050&#39;s 128-bit pipe, and the boost clock stops at 1,477MHz versus 1,740MHz. However, you&#39;ll still get the same 2,048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory, while peak power consumption drops to a much more reasonable 45W compared to the 80W of higher-end chips. This is partly meant for &#39;in-between&#39; laptops that don&#39;t have the chassis space or batteries for RTX 30 GPUs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has also revealed two entry-level chips, the MX550 and MX570, although it&#39;s shy on details beyond promises of more CUDA cores, faster memory and greater power efficiency than the MX450 they replace. The MX550 is based on the older Turing architecture, while the MX570 uses Ampere. Like with past MX chips, these are meant for thin-and-light portables where integrated graphics might not be good enough.</p><p>There&#39;s another issue beyond the branding: the release window. NVIDIA doesn&#39;t expect the RTX 2050 or new MX parts to reach shipping laptops until spring 2022.

As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/17/apple-releases-first-macos-12-2-beta-public-testers/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> notes, the OS comes with a new Music app that Apple had rebuilt as a full native application. Apple introduced macOS&#39; dedicated Music app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-apple-announces-separate-music-podcast-and-tv-apps-for-mac.html">back in 2019</a>, but it kept some iTunes elements for some parts of it, which means it still displays web content within the app.</p><p>Based on what <em>9to5Mac</em> has seen, macOS 12.2 beta uses AppKit, the framework needed to give applications a native interface. There won&#39;t be a big difference in looks, but the new app will apparently work faster. Searching for songs within Music, for instance, will appear more quickly because the results will be displayed on a native interface, while scrolling will feel smoother and trackpad gestures will feel more responsive.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to a brand new Music app, macOS 12.2 will also make scrolling in Safari smoother for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">14-and-16-inch MacBook Pro</a> models that support refresh rates of up to 120Hz. To test out macOS 12.2, you&#39;ll have to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/install-beta/">download and install</a> the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility. You&#39;ll then be able to access the latest beta update in the Software Update section of System Preferences.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-os-12-2-beta-public-134630683.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60fdd7a6-1382-4472-8d54-e6d29ab7f76b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 13:46:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639835193</ingested><modified>2021-12-18T13:46:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/35687d00-5ff1-11ec-bf6a-4b46920ab28e" width="4256" height="2832" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/35687d00-5ff1-11ec-bf6a-4b46920ab28e" width="4256" height="2832" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alberto Fava via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Recanati, Macerata, Italia - June 11, 2020: Brand new rose gold macbook air (2020) on a wooden table with the Apple logo highlighted in black, close up.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Brand new gold macbook air (2020) on a wooden table.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube TV loses access to ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has failed to strike a deal that would allow it to continue offering YouTube TV subscribers access to Disney&#39;s channels.

That’s according to screenshots shared this week by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-12-17/amazon-tornado-aftermath-workers-say-they-lacked-emergency-training"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a> that document an exchange that reportedly happened last Friday shortly before a tornado hit an Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Illinois, leading to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-tornado-edwardsville-illinois-deaths-climate-220437155.html"><ins>structural collapse and six deaths</ins></a>. “Just keep driving,” the dispatcher said in a message sent at 7:08PM that evening. “We can’t just call people back for a warning unless Amazon tells us to do so.”</p><p>After being told to “keep delivering” a second time about half an hour later, the driver said she wanted to turn back for her safety. “If you look at the radar, the worst of the storm is going to be right on top of me in 30 minutes.” To this, she was told she would lose her job if she drove back.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“If you decide to return with your packages, it will be viewed as you refusing your route, which will ultimately end with you not having a job come tomorrow morning,” the dispatcher said. “I’m literally stuck in this damn van without a safe place to go with a tornado on the ground,” the driver messaged back before being told to shelter in place.</p><p>In a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Amazon said the dispatcher didn’t follow safety guidelines. The company also said it’s investigating the incident and that the driver is safe. Here’s the full text of the statement it shared with the outlet:</p><blockquote><p>This was a developing situation across a broad geographic area, and unfortunately the delivery service partner’s dispatcher didn’t follow the standard safety practice. This dispatcher should have immediately directed the driver to seek shelter when the driver reported hearing tornado sirens. While this text exchange was going on, the local Amazon team was ensuring each delivery service partner had directed their drivers to shelter in place or seek shelter and advised them to stop delivering for the evening. We’re glad the driver is safe and we’re using the learnings from this incident to improve our policies and guidance for delivery service partners and drivers. Under no circumstance should the dispatcher have threatened the driver’s employment, and we’re investigating the full details of this incident and will take any necessary action.</p></blockquote><p>Amazon’s policies have led to several incidents where workers were expected to clock in even during extreme weather. In September, as tropical depression Ida caused widespread flooding throughout New York City, the retailer kept its warehouses open. In 2017, drivers told Engadget’s Bryan Menegus, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-last-mile-1820451224"><ins>then writing for </ins><em><ins>Gizmodo</ins></em></a>, they delivered packages in the immediate aftermath of hurricane Irma.

It wasn&#39;t quite as popular as its predecessor the PlayStation Portable (or its main rival <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-3ds-10th-anniversary-games-160019952.html">the Nintendo 3DS</a>), and Sony is still trying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-now-mobile-phones-181840562.html">to bring its gaming experience to mobile</a>, but the Vita still holds a special place in the hearts of those who owned one. At Engadget, that&#39;s Nathan Ingraham and Devindra Hardawar, who have both extolled the virtues of the system in our internal Slack many times over the years (yes, I checked). So on the Vita&#39;s 10th birthday we&#39;ve asked our resident experts what their favorite games for the system were, and inspired them to dig the shiny little handheld out of their closets for another go-around. — <em>Kris Naudus, Buyer&#39;s Guide Editor </em></p><h2><strong>Gravity Rush</strong></h2><div id="07026bc8a59344f3b4bf733386138740"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Q-p-41_V4Y?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The freedom of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-05-24-gravity-rush-review-disorient-express.html"><em>Gravity Rush</em>’s</a> acrobatic gameplay, which lets you fall through the air in every direction, as well as walk along the sides and bottoms of buildings, went hand-in-hand with the Vita’s portability. That made it a game I couldn’t help but love despite its frustrations. <em>Gravity Rush </em>took full advantage of the system’s motion controls — you had to tilt the Vita to control your flying momentum — and its watercolor anime aesthetic looked incredible on the Vita’s screen. Few games captured the magic of the system’s hardware that well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sure, the combat was simplistic and the story didn’t make much sense. But the visceral feeling of flying was hard to match, especially on a portable console. I never got around to playing the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:PlayStation 4 Gravity Rush remaster" href="https://amzn.to/3dWs2ZF">PlayStation 4 <em>Gravity Rush</em> remaster</a>, mostly because my memories of the game are so intimately tied to the Vita. I suppose it’s time to finally get over that hangup, though. The Vita is well and truly dead, and if I wanted to play the sequel, I have no choice but to move over to my PS4. — <em>Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Lumines: Electric Symphony</strong></h2><div id="c46dc0856e9d4f02b113e6db71a4b43d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h2AZPu6-8FU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Every portable console needs a good puzzle game. For the PS Vita, it was <em>Lumines: Electric Symphony</em>. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:The first Lumines game" href="https://amzn.to/3dWseYT">The first Lumines game</a> was a launch title for the Vita’s predecessor, the PlayStation Portable, and <em>Electric Symphony </em>arrived when the Vita went on sale. The basic gameplay remained the same: you manipulate 2-by-2 squares of varying colors together and match those colors to clear things out. If your screen gets overloaded, that’s that.</p><p>What makes <em>Lumines: Electric Symphony </em>so engrossing is the way the gameplay is matched up to the beat of a lengthy selection of classic electronic tunes from artists like LCD Soundsystem, Aphex Twin, The Chemical Brothers and about 30 more. Each song has a different speed, and that speed is reflected in the gameplay; it’s not like <em>Tetris </em>where things progressively get faster and faster. It’s actually more like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Tetris Effect" href="https://amzn.to/3yCcweX"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>, which was the first Tetris game to make music and sound <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-21-tetris-effect-ps4-synesthesia-psvr.html">a crucial part of the gameplay experience</a>.</p><p><em>Lumines: Electric Symphony</em> doesn’t reach the lofty heights of <em>Tetris</em> as a puzzle game, but that’s not a huge knock. It’s hard to compete with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-02-tetris-35th-birthday.html">one of the most popular video games of all time</a>, but <em>Electric Symphony </em>is still a great way to kill some time, either through a short session or a long play-through of the more than 30 tracks the game has to offer. — <em>Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Modnation Racers: Road Trip</strong></h2><div id="3e3b718453624b2982bd92b06af74ced"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/STUJsvn_qpE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Ever since <em>Super Mario Kart</em> arrived in 1992, game developers have tried to emulate its appeal with little success. For my money, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Modnation Racers: Road Trip" href="https://amzn.to/3p4iyBO"><em>Modnation Racers: Road Trip</em></a> came pretty damn close. The PS Vita title was a new version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-06-review-modnation-racers.html">a PS3 game that came out in 2010</a>. Both installments follow the Mario Kart script pretty closely: crazy tracks with weapons and items that let you even the odds against your competition.</p><p>What the Modnation Racers games did differently was offer endless customization — of your kart, racer and, most crucially, the courses themselves. Even on the somewhat scaled-back Vita game, you could download all manner of creations from the Modnation community, something that gave the game life for years until Sony inevitably shut down the servers.</p><p>Even without all the community content, though, <em>Modnation Racers: Road Trip</em> is still a blast to play. The 30 tracks in its career mode are extremely well designed, and the driving mechanics simply feel great. After almost 10 years, this game is showing its age, but it’s a great example of Sony’s promise to bring console-quality games to the Vita. The graphics don’t look quite as sharp as they used to, but the racing experience remains a blast. — <em>N.I.</em></p><h2><strong>OlliOlli</strong></h2><div id="ff23f58bd916479199b2d5cfc45aa30d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNYdqY72FxY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Sony initially pitched the PS Vita as a way to play console-quality games on the go, but its legacy is just as much about the smaller, indie games that hit the handheld. <em>OlliOlli </em>and its sequel <em>OlliOlli 2: Welcome to Olliwood</em> are two games that I played for hours on end, even though they weren’t as flashy and high-profile as games from bigger studios.</p><p><em>OlliOlli</em> is a masterful side-scrolling skateboarding game that combines lo-fi music and graphics with gameplay that was simple to learn, but maddening to master. And let me be clear, “maddening” is a complement. Once I figured out how to do more advanced moves and pull off longer combos to juice my score, I got addicted to the challenge of mastering every level.</p><p>And there’s a <em>ton</em> to master here; both games had five worlds to conquer, each with five “amateur” and “pro” levels. And, each level has five objectives to nail if you really want to be a completist. Usually, I don’t try to hit 100 percent of all the goals in a game, but here I was compelled to keep on pushing myself to beat as many challenges as I possibly could.</p><p>Both games have held up over the years, with the sequel adding crucial new mechanics like manuals, so you can skate through entire levels without stopping your combo. I recently replayed both, and still really enjoy trying to do a level as cleanly as possible — if you like chasing high scores, <em>OlliOlli </em>is a great option. And if you never tried these games, I’ve got some good news: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:both are available for current PlayStation consoles" href="https://amzn.to/3q1xxvK">both are available for current PlayStation consoles</a>, and a new game, <em>OlliOlli World</em>, is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/olli-olli-world-release-date-nintendo-switch-indie-world-showcase-183933899.html">coming out on February 8th</a>. — <em>N.I.</em></p><h2><strong>Persona 4 Golden</strong></h2><div id="0f005b3d66284e5994c5df39eda3bd9b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lnwXbSYcywg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>I couldn’t have asked for a better introduction to the world of Persona than this title on the Vita. <em>Persona 4 Golden’s</em> bold and colorful aesthetic practically popped off of the system’s OLED display. (I can’t say if the later LCD Vita handled it worse.) It also featured one of the most memorable JRPG soundtracks I’ve ever encountered. Best of all, the Vita’s portability was perfectly suited to <em>P4G</em>’s grind. Being able to bring the game outdoors, on the subway and all over my apartment made leveling up feel more like a genuine adventure, rather than a typical JRPG chore.</p><p>For me, someone who grew up with every iteration of Game Boy, <em>Persona 4 Golden</em> also proved that portable systems could finally deliver a premium experience similar to home consoles. Sure, there were limitations around battery life and screen size, but in 2012 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-03-vitas-persona-4-golden-is-both-exciting-and-worrisome.html">playing a deep and visually rich RPG</a> on the Vita felt like a miracle.

But the Vita is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-21-xenogears-mechs-its-way-to-psone-classics-this-week.html">one of the last systems I own</a> that can still run <em>Xenogears</em>, Square’s brilliant and enigmatic <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion-</em>esque RPG. As someone who was fundamentally shaped by both <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Evangelion</em> in the ‘90s, <em>Xenogears </em>is that rare bit of culture that has always felt specifically made for geeks like me. I love it all: the unique combat, the eclectic Yasunori Mitsuda score and the giant mech battles. Hell, I even dig the exposition-heavy final act. Once the Vita arrived, being able to play <em>Xenogears</em> on the go made me fall for it all over again. — <em>D.H.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-vita-10th-anniversary-favorite-games-200013083.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e14266b-6c01-4e8d-9c93-a23db24ae91a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus,Nathan Ingraham,Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 20:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639771219</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T20:00:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a31aaf0-5e9d-11ec-bfbf-6a81b667bd79" width="4200" height="3000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a31aaf0-5e9d-11ec-bfbf-6a81b667bd79" width="4200" height="3000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AnthonyRosenberg via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Vancouver, Canada -- April 7, 2012: Close up of a man playing on a PS Vita video game system.

And in 2020 the music industry <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-billie-eilish-grammy-2020-bedroom-studio-logic-pro-x.html">finally acknowledged</a> that songs recorded in someone’s bedroom were just as viable as those captured in a studio filled with millions of dollars worth of equipment. This has, of course, led many of those <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-13-solid-state-logic-ssl-2-plus-audio-interface.html">high-end studio equipment makers</a> to try and get in on the home studio game.</p><p>The latest to make the leap is Universal Audio. They’re a brand with over 60 years of experience, whose gear has been used to record some of the most iconic albums of all time. But, until recently the most affordable interface the company made was the $699 Apollo Solo – hardly the sort of money a beginner or casual hobbyist  is gonna drop. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volts-latest-audio-interfaces-offer-vintage-preamp-sound-on-the-cheap-103539898.html">Volt</a> series, however, ditches the company’s expensive DSP chips and focuses on delivering the basics with a few unique twists. The result is a collection of affordable audio interfaces that should be on the shortlist for any home studio setup.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Volt lineup includes <a href="https://www.uaudio.com/press/releases/2021/volt">five models</a> from the $139 single-input Volt 1, all the way up to the $369 four-input Volt 476. Some of the features are different and the number of ins and outs varies from model to model, but they share the same core including 24-bit/192 kHz audio converters and preamps with a “Vintage” mode that attempts to recreate the sound of a classic UA 610 tube preamp.</p><p>I tested two midrange models: the $189 Volt 2 and $299 Volt 276. These are both two-input interfaces. What separates the “76” versions from the base models are some ergonomic and design tweaks, and the inclusion of a built-in compressor modeled on the company’s iconic 1176 limiting amplifier.</p><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cbaa100-5f53-11ec-9fa6-3a469bb32492" alt="Universal Audio Volt" data-uuid="7b50affb-f4ad-32e7-a71b-e059675e96da"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Before you even start contemplating the compressor, though, the difference between the Volt 2 and 276 is immediately obvious. The 2 is simple and utilitarian. It looks like most other interfaces in the sub $200 range. There’s a pair of combination TRS / XLR inputs on the front, along with knobs to control the gain of each channel There’s buttons to turn on 48v phantom power for using condenser mics, Vintage mode, and for switching between line level and instrument level signals. Lastly, there’s a monitor volume knob, headphone jack and a button for turning on and off direct monitoring.</p><p>Around back are MIDI in and out ports (something notably absent from the company’s higher-end Apollo interfaces), balanced outs for connecting studio monitors, a USB-C port, a 5V power jack (necessary when using it with an iPad or other mobile device) and, somewhat strangely, an on and off switch.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1d0bf550-5f53-11ec-9e7c-fde27b772cc3" alt="Universal Audio Volt" data-uuid="4eafd278-f940-3cdb-9c12-716cdf499bd9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The rest of the Volt 2 is a plain box. On the plus side, if you have  limited desk space you can stick the Volt 2 in tight spots or rest things on top of it, and still have access to all the controls. On the downside, it can feel cramped,  especially when you’re trying to monitor your input levels. There are two tiny LEDs next to each input that light up to warn you when you’re about to start clipping.</p><p>The 276, on the other hand, is handsome and spacious. But you’re going to need  extra desk space since most of the controls are on the top. On the top right you’ll find large five-segment LEDs for checking your levels. The gain knob and monitor level knob on top are also much bigger, which makes it easier to dial things in.</p><p>In addition, the whole thing just has a lot more style. The metering LEDs are on a slight angle to make them easier to see, and the sides are a lovely wood. Are those aesthetic flourishes and conveniences alone worth the extra $100? Honestly, they might be.</p><h2>The competition</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cbb6450-5f53-11ec-a36d-68fa5ae762e2" alt="Universal Audio Volt" data-uuid="63c3c0c3-344e-3fec-8bc9-e1c5106bdb1e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Once you factor in the compressor, I think the choice between the two here is obvious, as long as your budget can handle it. The Volt 2 (and by extension the Volt 1) are reasonably priced, perfectly serviceable audio interfaces. But they don’t necessarily stand out from the crowd. Focusrite’s Scarlett series is well established, competitively priced and shares a lot of the same features. The third-generation Scarlett 2i2 is $170 ($20 less than the Volt 2), shares all of the same connectivity options and has “Air” mode, which is comparable to UA’s Vintage.</p><p>Most importantly, though, you’d be hard pressed to tell the difference between the two if your goal is to capture the clean audio. With Air and Vintage turned off and the gain on the preamps set to lower levels, both interfaces produce crisp and clear results. Are there differences? Sure. But they’re <em>extremely </em>subtle. I wouldn’t be able to separate a Volt, from a Scarlett, from an Arturia Minifuse in blind taste test. And I doubt the target audience of hobbyists and beginners would be able to either.</p><p>(If you want to get really nerdy about the signal-to-noise ratio and noise floor and frequency response, I highly recommend <a href="https://youtu.be/CLAO_OtsqOU">Julian Krause’s YouTube channel</a>.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cbb8b60-5f53-11ec-be5f-c2ba74a324b1" alt="Universal Audio Volt" data-uuid="f6eb7dc6-453d-349f-939d-24ea8043968f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Latency among all of these is pretty similar too. I gathered the interfaces I had lying around – the Volt 2, Volt 276, Focusrite Scarlett 2i4 second-gen, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-announces-mini-fuse-lineup-of-affordable-audio-interfaces-204411420.html">Arturia MiniFuse 2</a> – and plugged them into my MacBook Pro (2019, quad-core Core i7 CPU, 16GB of RAM) and Dell XPS 15 (2019, quad-core Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM), set the sample rate to 44,100Hz and buffer size to 128 samples and measured total latency in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-daw-hands-on-review-upgrades-explained-160047192.html">Ableton Live 11</a>. All four interfaces delivered the same exact latency of 12.2ms on the Mac. On the Dell, both Volts came in at just 8.89ms, the MiniFuse at 9.89ms and the Scarlett brought up the rear at 12.9ms. While lower latency is obviously better, none of those numbers are particularly alarming.</p><p>That difference starts to show up a bit more when you crank the gain and push the preamps on these interfaces. I plugged my Fender Toronado with Atomic humbuckers directly into the Volt 2, Volt 276, 2i4 and MiniFuse. I cranked the preamp gain on each all the way up and fed them into a basic clean amp simulator in Ableton. Here the differences are a little more obvious, but they’re not that dramatic – at least until you turn on the 276’s compressor.</p><p>The MiniFuse at full gain is a tad brittle and sounds like a full-on fuzz pedal. The Scarlett has a touch more bottom end and slightly scooped mids, but is still plenty aggressive. While the Volt 2 is a touch thinner at the bottom end and puts more focus on the mids and highs. The compressor on the 276 makes a huge difference here, though. It softens the edges a bit and tames some of the harsher frequencies. It’s worth noting that all of these sound pretty harsh at the higher frequencies with the gain turned all the way up. Then again, it’s unlikely that anyone will be cranking these preamps to max on a regular basis.</p><p>Unfortunately, I did not have an SSL2+ on hand to test, which would have been the better comparison for the Volt 276.</p><h2>The 76 Compressor</h2><section data-eng-breakout="8cf275a5587e480d8427aec85e39d884" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cbb6450-5f53-11ec-be6f-269c0920f00c" alt="Universal Audio Volt"></section><p>The compressor on the 176, 276 and 476 are really what separate the Volt line from the pack. Both Vintage mode and the 76 Compressor are analog emulations, not digital recreations. But SSL and Focusrite have something similar to Vintage in 4K and Air. Essentially, they boost high frequencies while adding saturation. The 76 Compressor, though, is completely unique in this price range at least.</p><p>Now, if you record anything using the builtin compressor it’s obviously printed to the audio permanently. So, if you want to retain the most flexibility in your recordings for tweaking in DAW later, you’ll leave Vintage Mode and the 76 Compressor off. But if you just want to capture the best recording possible from moment one and leave less work for your plugins to do later, never turn Vintage off and use that compressor generously.</p><p>Vintage mode delivers relatively subtle changes in tone. I rarely plug directly into my interface, and instead run through a Tascam Portastudio 424 as a mixer first because I love the sound of the preamps. Still, I found myself leaving Vintage mode on all the time. It added a different flavor of analog warmth than the Portastudio and I liked the way the two things complemented each other.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cbb6450-5f53-11ec-aef3-d700948ecd39" alt="Universal Audio Volt" data-uuid="2fb77d89-877a-3143-95a3-fd5052f67345"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The 76 Compressor, on the other hand, is not particularly subtle. It makes an obvious and dramatic difference to your sound. I would not leave it on <em>all</em> the time. But if I were recording directly to the interface, I’d probably leave it on most of the time. The main issue is that you can’t dial in any specifics. The compressor has three presets: vocals, guitar and fast, and you simply switch between them by pressing a button. For recording vocals – especially something spoken like a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-the-best-podcasting-gear-for-beginners.html">podcast</a> or voice over – the 76 Compressor is incredible. I would absolutely use it on voice no matter what. Fast mode is excellent on drums… or at least drum machines. I don’t have an actual drum set in my home to test it with.</p><h2>Miscellaneous</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cbbb270-5f53-11ec-aedf-b6efdf11d0e4" alt="Universal Audio Volt" data-uuid="a43c200f-48ed-3356-98fb-deb03b3f1cea"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>One other thing you can’t really dial in is direct monitoring. Being able to hear raw audio as it’s coming into the interface is essential, but other devices like the MiniFuse and the Scarlett let you manually set the balance between direct monitoring and audio from the PC. On the Volt, it’s simply on or off. If you press the direct button input one and two get panned hard left and right, press it again and they’re both summed to mono. And that’s it. If the direct input is too loud, you either need to change the gain on the preamp or turn up the volume in your DAW.</p><p>One last thing to mention is the software bundle that comes with the Volt. It’s not bad, but frankly there are better ones. The big coup here is Melodyne Essentials, a $99 app that lets you correct pitch and timing of recordings, sort of like Autotune. Relab LX480 Essentials reverb is another standout that recreates Lexicon’s famous digital 480L reverb from the ‘80s. The other inclusions are enough to get you making music, but don’t bring anything special to the table. The Softube amp sim and Ableton’s Live 11 Lite are often included with other interfaces as well, and <a href="https://labs.spitfireaudio.com/">Spitfire Audio’s LABS</a> instruments are free and can be downloaded by anyone. (Also, if you don’t have Spitfire’s LABS you should rectify that, like right now.)</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><section data-eng-breakout="654601f8efe749ac818ee35743810962" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cbaa100-5f53-11ec-95ff-748405cd2698" alt="Universal Audio Volt"></section><p>Universal Audio’s first serious foray into the budget interface world is definitely a success. The Volt 1 and 2 don’t necessarily separate themselves from the pack, but they’re still excellent audio interfaces at reasonable prices. The Volt 176, 276 and 476, however, bring something special to the table – an all-analog emulation of one of the most iconic compressors of all time. They also have a stylish and ergonomic design that many other interfaces in this pricepoint can’t match.</p><p>My trusty Scarlett 2i4 gets the job done and I don’t feel any particular urgency to replace it. But I can tell you that if I had to go out and buy a new interface today, I would probably pick up the Volt 476.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/universal-audio-volt-2-volt-276-review-audio-interface-home-studio-170050385.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dd05a464-d812-44c8-b000-a3a7a79136ee</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 17:00:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639846728</ingested><modified>2021-12-18T16:59:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cbf5bf0-5f53-11ec-b7fa-3f3e072c6f15" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1cbf5bf0-5f53-11ec-b7fa-3f3e072c6f15" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Universal Audio Volt]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Universal Audio Volt]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's latest AirPods drop to $140, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With Christmas right around the corner, now&#39;s the time to make sure you have all your gifts in check and grab any last-minute holiday gifts you may need.

They&#39;ll start with around 300 locations and plan to expand to more than 1,000 by the end of 2022. Virtual Dining Concepts has notable experience in this field, having worked with YouTube megastar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mrbeast/"><ins>MrBeast</ins></a> on his MrBeast Burger virtual restaurants (that brand&#39;s first brick-and-mortar location is now in the works).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The TikTok Kitchen menu, which will change on a quarterly basis, will include some of the platform&#39;s biggest food trends.

However, the service didn&#39;t clarify how it will determine the true creators of the dishes, as opposed to a user who might have copied a recipe and made it go viral.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-kitchen-food-delivery-virtual-dining-concepts-160335181.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">65a04982-cd35-46f9-bfe3-7a6ea9e92c3f</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 16:03:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639757019</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T16:03:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6d595970-5f4f-11ec-a3e9-b3e6f4a76cd4" width="1200" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6d595970-5f4f-11ec-a3e9-b3e6f4a76cd4" width="1200" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TikTok/Virtual Dining Concepts]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A promo image for TikTok Kitchen, featuring dishes including baked feta pasta.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TikTok Kitcken]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
