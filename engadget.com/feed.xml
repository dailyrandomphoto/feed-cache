When Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-fee-reduction-july-1-172359771.html">announced the change back in March</a>, it claimed it would reduce the fees it takes from 99 percent of Android developers by 50 percent. Later this year, Google also plans to enforce a policy that will require all developers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-google-play-194125627.html">process their payments through the Play Store&#39;s billing system</a>. The announcement led to uproar among companies like Netflix and Spotify that had in the past skirted that requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While the Play Store comes preinstalled on the majority of Android devices, it is not the only place where you can download software to your phone. Amazon and Samsung operate their own app stores. It&#39;s also possible to sideload Android apps from websites like APK Mirror, allowing you to bypass the Play Store completely. Both those facts are not true of iOS devices where Apple&#39;s App Store is the only place where you can download software for your iPhone or iPad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Today&#39;s suit also comes a little more than a week after a federal judge in Washington <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judge-dismisses-ftc-antitrust-complaint-facebook-193524091.html">dismissed the FTC&#39;s antitrust complaint against Facebook</a>, saying the agency hadn&#39;t presented sufficient evidence to back up its claims that the social media giant is a monopoly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 07/07/21 10:30PM ET: </strong>Colorado has joined the lawsuit against Google, bringing the total number of states to 37. The tech giant has <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/lawsuit-ignores-choice-android-and-google-play/">published</a> a blog post defending its practices, however, calling the lawsuit &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;meritless&quot; for &quot;attacking a system that provides more openness and choice than others.&quot; Google&#39;s Senior Director of Public Policy, Wilson White, concluded the post with this note: &quot;This lawsuit isn&#39;t about helping the little guy or protecting consumers. It&#39;s about boosting a handful of major app developers who want the benefits of Google Play without paying for it.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-suit-211116918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">13888926-80a4-45a3-86b9-6cc3fdde71d1</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 21:11:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625714860</ingested><modified>2021-07-08T03:27:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/e4091510-131a-11eb-afff-9e5bdac4793b" width="2200" height="1466" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/e4091510-131a-11eb-afff-9e5bdac4793b" width="2200" height="1466" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jim Young / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google CEO Sundar Pichai is sworn in prior to testifying at a House Judiciary Committee hearing “examining Google and its Data Collection, Use and Filtering Practices” on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., December 11, 2018.

Following the launch of the OnePlus 9 and 9 Pro in March, some users told us about some areas where we could improve the devices&#39; battery life and heat management. As a result of this feedback, our R&amp;D team has been working over the past few months to optimize the devices&#39; performance when using many of the most popular apps, including Chrome, by matching the app&#39;s processor requirements with the most appropriate power. This has helped to provide a smooth experience while reducing power consumption. While this may impact the devices&#39; performance in some benchmarking apps, our focus as always is to do what we can to improve the performance of the device for our users.</p></blockquote><p>If you&#39;ve been following OnePlus for a while, you&#39;ll know the company is no stranger to this type of controversy. Back in the days of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-01-oneplus-3t-benchmark-cheating.html">OnePlus 3T</a>, the company included code in OxygenOS that would artificially boost the clock speeds of the phone&#39;s Snapdragon processor when running certain benchmark apps. <em>XDA</em> caught the company doing <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5-benchmark-cheating-reviews/">something similar with the OnePlus 5</a>.</p><p>On the face of things, the situation here is different. OnePlus is throttling the OnePlus 9 Pro and OnePlus 9 to save on battery life. And while most people won&#39;t notice unless they have another Snapdragon 888 device next to their phone, the company was still mispresenting the capabilities of those devices based on the fact they it throttle benchmarking apps.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-throttling-200547997.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">630dcf7f-1ed7-4b29-b7bb-324dcda8a7ae</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 20:05:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625689232</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T20:20:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/469fea50-df5d-11eb-9fa7-40b26c97f4e1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/469fea50-df5d-11eb-9fa7-40b26c97f4e1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[OnePlus]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OnePlus 9 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OnePlus 9 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok tests letting US users to apply for jobs with video resumes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-job-recruitment-tool-report-191359350.html">reports were accurate</a>: TikTok is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/find-a-job-with-tiktok-resumes">expanding into job recruitment</a>.

In the US alone, roughly 8 percent of the population comes down with the flu every winter. The company hopes this vaccine will prove more potent than the current 40 to 60 percent efficacy rate of conventional flu vaccines.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“We are pleased to have begun this Phase 1/2 study of mRNA-1010, our first mRNA seasonal flu vaccine candidate to enter the clinic. We expect that our seasonal influenza vaccine candidates will be an important component of our future combination respiratory vaccines,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said. “Respiratory combination vaccines are an important pillar of our overall mRNA vaccine strategy. We believe that the advantages of mRNA vaccines include the ability to combine different antigens to protect against multiple viruses and the ability to rapidly respond to the evolution of respiratory viruses, such as influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and RSV. Our vision is to develop an mRNA combination vaccine so that people can get one shot each fall for high efficacy protection against the most problematic respiratory viruses.&quot;</p><p>This vaccine has been generated using the same genomic techniques the company utilized to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/covid-vaccine-research-and-development-150052906.html">develop its COVID-19 treatment in 2020</a>. The technique works by exploiting the human body&#39;s own cells to reproduce snippets of viral DNA to instigate an immune response and prime the body against future infection. Since this method doesn&#39;t require the entire virus (either weakened or dead) but rather just a birt of its genetic code, mRNA vaccines could be applied to any number of deadly modern diseases including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mrna-tech-we-used-against-covid-could-help-us-finally-beat-malaria-153045965.html">malaria, TB — even cancer</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/moderna-submits-its-m-rna-based-flu-vaccine-for-clinical-trials-172548543.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">358fdb8b-5098-412b-92a4-48714f431ece</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 17:25:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625681450</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T18:11:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Infectious Diseases]]></category><category><![CDATA[Epidemic & Plague]]></category><category><![CDATA[Public Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pharmaceuticals & Drug Trials]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/506149b0-df46-11eb-bd9e-512445e5014c" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/506149b0-df46-11eb-bd9e-512445e5014c" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Medical syringes in the mini shopping trolley are seen in front of the Moderna logo displayed on a screen.

Let Sony and Microsoft duke it out for 4K dominance — Nintendo can show there’s still plenty to love about games in 1080p and below. Sticking with the same hardware also means developers don’t have to worry about splitting the Switch user base, an issue that’s plagued Nintendo systems over the last few decades. (Was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-29-nintendo-3ds-review-new-3ds.html">New 3DS</a> actually worth it?)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bmw-honda-production-chip-crisis-124350237.html">global chip shortage</a> may have foiled Nintendo’s plans to stuff better hardware in this Switch, as well. The system currently uses a custom version of NVIDIA’s Tegra X1 system-on-a-chip, which was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-17-nintendo-switch-upgraded-battery-life.html">quietly updated in 2019</a> to increase the console’s battery life. According to various reports, Nintendo was exploring docked 4K upscaling using NVIDIA’s DLSS technology, which uses AI processing to bump lower-resolution textures up to something that looks far sharper. But that technology would have required an updated Tegra chip that brought over some of the hardware from NVIDIA’s recent RTX GPUs. That’s not an impossible task, but it’s one that may have required more work than NVIDIA was able to accomplish during the hellscape of 2020 (at least, while keeping the final cost reasonable).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0370e9b0-df3e-11eb-bec7-1c955b9d7f3d" alt="Nintendo OLED Switch" data-uuid="7be3a59e-e8e7-35a0-9937-6d314a89ca4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>That doesn’t mean dreams of a 4K-capable Switch are dead; it’s just something we’ll have to wait a year or two to see. Nintendo would also need to add more RAM to the Switch so it could better handle the 1080p textures required for DLSS upscaling. That’s not easy to do with the system’s meager 4GB of RAM, so a future console would need 6GB or 8GB. And don’t forget, Nintendo also needs to balance delivering solid battery life with the Switch in handheld mode, so it needs to be careful about shoving in demanding new hardware.</p><p>For owners of the original Switch, or newcomers to the platform, this OLED model still seems like an enticing upgrade. The larger screen makes the system look more modern, with less of a chunky display bezel. OLED will also make games look dramatically better, especially while playing outside in direct sunlight. There’s also a wider kickstand, similar to the one of the Microsoft Surface tablets, which should make portable play a lot more stable. There’s also 64GB of internal storage, up from 32GB, and “enhanced audio,” which could just refer to better speakers. Nintendo isn’t getting very specific there.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/03704d70-df3e-11eb-bddf-b215b32ed725" alt="Nintendo OLED Switch" data-uuid="5007a9b5-8a73-3c44-bdfa-5f8e6622cc14"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>And if you’re really into online multiplayer, you’ll likely appreciate the Ethernet port built into the OLED Switch’s dock. (And if that’s the main draw for you, Nintendo says the dock is also compatible with the old Switch models.) Due to the larger screen, though, Nintendo says the OLED Switch may run into issues with some Labo kits and other games.</p><p>I get it, $350 is a lot to shell out for a slightly better Switch. That’s particularly true when you can get the disc-less PlayStation 5 for $399, or the full PS5 and Xbox Series X for $499. But for Nintendo diehards, the improvements are definitely tempting. Just don’t be surprised if the company ends up dropping the 4K-capable Switch during the 2022 holiday season.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-oled-switch-not-switch-pro-161744624.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97cc4a00-f020-47fd-a967-9f76ef814ff9</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 16:17:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625681630</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T18:14:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/036c07b0-df3e-11eb-bf6e-dcbe081479b3" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/036c07b0-df3e-11eb-bf6e-dcbe081479b3" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo OLED Switch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo OLED Switch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bungie will reveal what's next for 'Destiny 2' on August 24th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Destiny%202"><em><ins>Destiny 2</ins></em></a> fans will soon find out more about the future of the game.

Trump announced the legal bid at a press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey, promising the case would lead to an &quot;end of the shadow banning, a stop to the silencing and the canceling that you know so well.&quot; Trump and his lawyers, many of whom he said come from the tobacco industry, plan to file the lawsuits in the Southern District of Florida and hope to obtain class action status with each one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Trump alleges the tech giants violated his First Amendment rights and even calls Facebook a &quot;state actor&quot; in one of the suits.

The Linux Foundation will manage the project and form an Open 3D Foundation to foster development. Amazon is a founding member alongside tech heavyweights like Adobe, Huawei, Niantic and Red Hat.</p><p>While the original Lumberyard was based on the Crytek engine, the version you&#39;ll get as Open 3D Engine was rewritten and is free of possible patent headaches, according to Amazon. It also boasts a new, more photorealistic renderer as well as many of the other tools you&#39;d need to build a game or simulation, including an animation system, a content editor and visual scripting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is relatively untouched ground for developers. They don&#39;t always have to pay for engines, but they rarely have full freedom to modify the code for their own ends — and those that do often keep the modifications for themselves. Open 3D Engine not only allows extensive customization, but will encourage creators to contribute to the wider community. That theoretically strengthens the technology and helps it move faster than commercial tech like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unreal-engine-5-early-access-152553496.html">Unreal Engine</a> and Unity.</p><p>There is a financial incentive for Amazon, though — open source may be its best chance at fostering growth. Amazon hasn&#39;t had much success with in-house games built on Lumberyard, having <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-cancels-crucible-003348633.html">cancelled <em>Crucible</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-delays-new-world-august-31-202202548.html">delayed <em>New World</em></a>. The shift to Open 3D Engine could spur adoption and encourage studios to use AWS, Twitch and other services that hook into the platform. Amazon could reap the rewards of Open 3D Engine even if its dreams of becoming a AAA game creator never come to pass.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lumberyard-game-engine-open-source-150615764.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4de1c90-ce96-4616-8dc8-2867331543ad</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 15:06:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625672877</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T15:48:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/99a114e0-df3a-11eb-b7cf-1fcc6d2a5d4a" width="1600" height="1019" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/99a114e0-df3a-11eb-b7cf-1fcc6d2a5d4a" width="1600" height="1019" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A still from Amazon's Lumberyard video game.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon's Lumberyard game]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BMW's futuristic electric scooter is straight out of anime]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When we saw <a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2020/11/11/bmw-ce-04-scooter-concept/">BMW&#39;s CE 04 electric scooter concept last year</a>, it looked like something pulled straight out of a science fiction film.

Aimed at the urban commuter, the CE 04 features a 10.25-inch LCD screen (that&#39;s bigger than what&#39;s in most cars!), up to 81 miles of range, and a top speed of 75mph. It&#39;ll be available in 2022 for around $16,000.

It&#39;s a fresh new design that&#39;s meant to entice people who are interested in EVs, but may not have the money or space for an actual electric car. It can charge with a regular power plug or EV cables, and BMW claims it can quick charge after being completely drained in one hour and 40 minutes with a level 3 power connection. Still, even if you don&#39;t have the fanciest charging setup around, BMW says it can juice up in four hours and 20 minutes with a standard household socket.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While we&#39;re still waiting for more details on the CE 04&#39;s pricing and optional accessories, you can expect to see a reduced output model with a range of around 62 miles (100Km). That cheaper model will also spit out between 15hp and 30hp, whereas the standard one can reach up 42hp. Both versions should be well equipped for city traffic though, with the ability to reach 31mph in 2.6 seconds.&nbsp;</p><div id="f3767166ffce432ca6c1c72f14e34ae8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3VRmsR-SsRs?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bmw-ce-04-electric-scooter-144505285.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16a32cdd-9585-42af-88c7-12fc8d4a41f2</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 14:45:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625668804</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T14:40:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9fffe751-df2e-11eb-bdff-b4ada7bcdc22" width="2000" height="1093" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9fffe751-df2e-11eb-bdff-b4ada7bcdc22" width="2000" height="1093" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BMW CE 04]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BMW CE 04]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grubhub and Yandex bring autonomous deliveries to US college campuses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/grubhub">Grubhub</a> is teaming up with Russian tech giant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/yandex">Yandex</a> to deliver food to students and others on US college campuses with the help of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-yandex-autonomous-delivery-robots-testing-moscow.html">autonomous robots</a>.

Instead of playing mostly by yourself in one historical period, you&#39;d routinely join other players across &quot;multiple settings&quot; that would grow and evolve over time. You&#39;d have a reason to keep playing (and keep paying) for a long time where AC currently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-valhalla-siege-of-paris-dlc-200711445.html">relies heavily on DLC</a> and frequent sequels to stay fresh.</p><p>While there would be individual games tied to <em>Infinity</em> with their own look and feel, they&#39;d all be linked together, the sources said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/GZi5hT4dBeM8YITOsJeCn/an-update-on-assassins-creed-infinity-and-the-future-of-the-assassins-creed-franchise">confirmed</a> that <em>Infinity</em> exists, but wouldn&#39;t explain the game in detail. It&#39;s meant to please fans who want a &quot;more cohesive approach&quot; to the game universe, the company said.</p><p>Upheaval at the company might threaten the project, however. Ubisoft recently unified its Montreal and Quebec City teams to help Assassin&#39;s Creed flourish through shared talent. While that could strengthen the quality of each release, Quebec will lead the franchise — a problem when that studio and Montreal have had bitter rivalries at times.</p><p>More importantly, there are concerns Ubisoft hasn&#39;t fully addressed the misconduct claims that led to the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-valhalla-creative-director-misconduct-151932648.html">firing its chief creative officer</a> and certain studio leaders. A spokeswoman said Ubisoft had investigated all claims and taken appropriate actions, but <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s contacts said that managers accused of abuse remained in senior roles and that employees were reporting racism and sexism that wasn&#39;t being addressed.</p><p>That, in turn, could limit Ubisoft&#39;s resources for <em>Infinity</em>. While poaching from studios near Ubisoft Montreal is a problem, misconduct claims have also lead to more staffers jumping ship from that location. Simply speaking, Ubisoft might need to redouble its efforts to stamp out toxic behavior if it&#39;s going to retain the talent it needs to produce its best work.</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>Ubisoft, in response to claims of misconduct, said that it &quot; takes each and every allegation seriously and conducted a series of investigations over the last year led by independent third parties taking swift and appropriate actions based on their outcome, including warnings, removal of managerial responsibility or dismissal.&quot; While it declined to go into specifics, it said that &quot;any employee that had allegations and remain at Ubisoft has had their case rigorously reviewed by a third party and were either exonerated or underwent appropriate disciplinary actions.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-infinity-live-online-game-service-135340262.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9899cd9b-1e28-4283-a2f3-ff47215c03d4</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 13:53:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625673170</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T15:53:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/408ba320-df21-11eb-8dff-51d734b2c703" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/408ba320-df21-11eb-8dff-51d734b2c703" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Assassin's Creed Valhalla' field fight]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Assassin's Creed Valhalla' field fight]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's Mac Mini M1 is back on sale for $600 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">colorful new iMac</a> may be too flashy for some, and those people should look to the Mac Mini M1 for a similarly powerful desktop experience.

You don&#39;t get a 4.5K Retina Display like you do with the latest iMacs, but that&#39;s not a huge deal if you have a monitor that you already love — plus your preferred keyboard and mouse setup as well.</p><p>Aside from its compact size, this Mac Mini&#39;s biggest draw is the new M1 chipset, which has proven to be blazing fast on every machine <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">we&#39;ve tested</a> with it. Switching between apps is a breeze, systems wake almost instantaneously and playing Apple Arcade games won&#39;t make the Mac Mini break a sweat. It&#39;s also worth noting that the Mac Mini M1 comes with an 8-core GPU, which is slightly better than the 7-core GPU on the base iMac.</p><p>Apple focused on the internals here, so the exterior design of the Mac Mini hasn&#39;t changed. It&#39;s still a sleek square on which the back edge houses all of its ports: an Ethernet connector, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, one HDMI 2.0 connector, two USB-A ports and a headphone jack. That&#39;s another perk of the Mini when compared to the new iMac, which only has two or four Thunderbolt ports depending on the configuration. Overall, Amazon&#39;s sale is a good opportunity for those with aging desktops to get an M1 machine as a replacement for less.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m1-sale-600-with-coupon-amazon-124557506.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5fbf62f0-8480-4be5-841f-c27066cc6645</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 12:45:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625661983</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T12:46:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bentley's Flying Spur Hybrid can travel 25 miles in EV mode]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bentley-plugin-hybrid-ev-2026-094121635.html">announcing</a> a shift to hybrid and fully electric cars by 2026, Bentley has begun showcasing the existing vehicles getting an eco-friendly makeover. Following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-bentley-bentayga-hybrid-revealed-163000296.html">Bentayga Hybrid</a> SUV, the spotlight is now on the more powerful <a href="https://www.bentleymedia.com/en/newsitem/1234">Flying Spur</a> sedan.&nbsp;</p><p>Bentley&#39;s second plug-in hybrid features a 410 break horsepower (bhp) 2.9-liter V-6 with twin turbochargers, paired with a 134 bhp electric motor, for a combined 536 bhp. That&#39;s 95 bhp more than its SUV counterpart. While the luxury vehicle&#39;s 0-60mph acceleration time of 4.1 seconds and top speed of 177mph is just shy of the standard Flying Spur V8.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e8f69fc0-df1b-11eb-bef7-786d6bababbc" alt="Bentley Flying Spur Hybrid" data-uuid="ec36cc6b-432f-36c5-947a-467b955bc850"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bentley</div></figure><p>To improve emissions, the new engine uses fuel injectors and spark plugs centralized within each combustion chamber for &quot;optimal spray patterns.&quot; While the twin-scroll turbos and catalytic converts are positioned within the V of the engine.</p><p>Bentley says the Flying Spur packs a 14.1kWh battery to offer an expected all-electric range of around 25 miles, pending certification. With many city centres requiring hybrids to switch to full EV mode, those figures will be critical. Some car makers like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fiat-chrysler-plug-in-hybrids-electric-only-mode-161611941.html">Fiat</a> and BMW have even developed tech that can fully switch hybrids to all-electric drive in low emissions zones.&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to that feature, Bentley says the hybrid manages battery usage by automatically shifting between three drive modes, including EV, allowing it to store up energy for when you reach the city. The sedan&#39;s combined petrol-electric range is more than 435 miles.</p><p>Visually, little separates the new plug-in hybrid from the rest of Flying Spur range, apart from a charging port on the left rear wing and an understated hybrid badge on the front. As you&#39;d expect, this is a car for the uber-rich. Prices for the Flying Spur Hybrid are expected to start from an eye-watering £160,000 in its native UK, according to <a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/bentley/flying-spur/355476/new-bentley-flying-spur-hybrid-arrives-536bhp"><em>Auto Express</em></a>, with sales beginning this summer and deliveries to kickstart before the end of the year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bentley-flying-spur-hybrid-ev-121920123.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10d9ea49-5001-4a0f-9a5e-6e03f47b2b3f</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 12:19:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625660991</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T12:30:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1b38c30-df1e-11eb-917f-7da331f53099" width="3251" height="1925" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d1b38c30-df1e-11eb-917f-7da331f53099" width="3251" height="1925" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bentley]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Bentley Flying Spur plug-in hybrid drives down a highway with hills in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bentley Flying Spur]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian hackers breached a GOP contractor]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A state-sponsored Russian hacking group infiltrated the computer systems of a Republican National Committee (RNC) contractor over the weekend. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/russian-state-hackers-breached-republican-national-committee?sref=ExbtjcSG"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>originally revealed that the RNC suffered a breach at the hands of prolific hackers APT29, aka Cozy Bear, who are believed to be behind a spate of high-profile cyberattacks on the US and its allies.&nbsp;</p><p>However, GOP officials were quick to refute that report, interjecting that the actual victim was a third-party IT services provider known as Synnex.

Still, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html">the OLED Switc</a>h is the most grown-up-looking Switch so far, with smaller bezels, a new off-white dock and matching Joy-Cons. The core upgrade is — shockingly — the screen: a new seven-inch OLED panel that should offer crisper graphics when played as a handheld. However, the resolution hasn’t changed, so it’s been stretched a little wider than the original 6.2-inch LCD Switch.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7c4907c0-df0a-11eb-b7e7-9d56957bd6b0" alt="Nintendo OLED Switch" data-uuid="28c45b18-421b-3e11-a8ac-0189c30dd752"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure></a><p>I can run through the rest of the changes, as there aren’t all that many. There’s now 64GB of internal storage — another grown-up upgrade — while a wider, more solid-looking kickstand replaces the flimsy plastic tab on the original Switch. You can adjust this to multiple angles for more comfortable table-top / airplane-tray-table gaming. The new off-white dock also has an Ethernet port built-in, while the core OLED Switch has improved speakers. Otherwise, there’s no newer processor and, seemingly, no battery-life improvements. (The company hasn’t offered any battery estimates yet on its official site.)</p><p>The OLED Switch is not for current Switch owners looking to upgrade — although I don’t doubt some of us will buy one. It’s a refined version of the original (or maybe I’m easily tricked by monochrome color schemes), but seems expressly aimed at handheld players, who are the ones that’ll benefit from the bigger OLED screen.

The short-form video app has begun allowing some users to pay creators for custom clips in the vein of startup Cameo. With Big Tech <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-reels-remix-tiktok-duet-190201529.html">copycats</a> in hot <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-creators-fund-100-million-172643630.html">pursuit</a>, it seems TikTok isn&#39;t against the idea of borrowing features itself, as long as they help it to maintain its grip on Gen Z. For now, only users in Turkey and Dubai appear to have access to the test, according to social media posts spotted by <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/laurenstrapagiel/tiktok-appears-to-be-testing-a-cameo-like-shoutouts-feature?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"><em>BuzzFeed</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The new feature is reportedly called &quot;Shoutouts&quot; and essentially lets you request and pay for a video from a creator using TikTok coins, the in-app currency purchased with real money and used to tip others. It seems creators can set a rate for their services, with the final product delivered to your inbox. In all, your custom video could take longer than a week to arrive as TikTok appears to be reviewing the clips first. After all, it doesn&#39;t want the feature to become the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/content-creator-suing-thothub-copyright-onlyfans-160301130.html">OnlyFans</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>TikTok seemingly views shoutouts as way for users to request happy birthday greetings and pep talks from popular creators. Though, it&#39;s currently unclear how many followers a person needs to have in order to make money from shoutouts. Based on the ingenuity of its talent base, you can probably expect some of the results to be more creative than direct-to-camera chats.&nbsp;</p><p>TikTok isn&#39;t the only social app emulating Cameo. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-super-cameo-clone-021440553.html">Facebook is also working on &quot;Super,&quot;</a> a service that lets users pay to interact with influencers in live streams. Meanwhile, Cameo is doing gangbusters, according to its management. Last year, the video requests service raked in gross revenue of $100 million, 75 percent of which was paid to talent, reports <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/cameo-steven-galanis-celebrity-videos-1234908473/"><em>Variety</em></a>.

That means the next <em>Jurassic World</em> and the new <em>Halloween</em> movie will make their TV debut on the streaming service also owned by its parent company Comcast. According to <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/universal-moves-hbo-peacock-streaming-service-1235012751/"><em>Variety</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/universal-pictures-deepens-ties-to-peacock-streaming-service-in-new-movie-deal-11625603414"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Universal&#39;s films will appear exclusively on Peacock for streaming within four months after their theatrical release, as well as within the final four months of an 18-month window.&nbsp;</p><p>Those 10 months in between, the films will be licensed to around two to three additional partners, though none of them will have exclusive rights to the movies. Universal has yet to release the list of additional partners, and it&#39;s unclear if HBO is one of them. <em>Variety</em> says that by adopting the segmented TV release schedule, Universal is hoping to avoid over-saturation or making its films seem stale. In addition, streaming platforms are apparently willing to pay top dollar for popular movies these days in an effort to stand out from their ever-increasing number of rivals out there.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether the move leads to a boost in subscriber numbers for Peacock remains to be seen. Comcast made the streaming service available to more potential viewers just a month ago by releasing apps for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-june-24th-213039722.html">Amazon Fire TV</a> and tablets and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nbcuniversal-peacock-samsung-smart-tvs-213645435.html">Samsung&#39;s smart TVs</a>. Peacock also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-live-sports-premier-lacrosse-league-174844210.html">grew</a> its live sports portfolio recently and announced that it&#39;s streaming 44 Premier Lacrosse League games for the season that started on June 4th.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6605d081-37f3-475d-b5dc-c5e281d686db</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 07 Jul 2021 04:10:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625631033</ingested><modified>2021-07-07T04:10:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ccfc5a70-ded6-11eb-952f-1a21069181a3" width="1600" height="1048" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ccfc5a70-ded6-11eb-952f-1a21069181a3" width="1600" height="1048" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Universal Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jurassic World]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jurassic World]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Verizon modified a Ford F650 to provide first-responders with mobile 5G access]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Texas was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engadget-podcast-texas-storm-power-grid-133029237.html"><ins>hit by an extreme cold snap</ins></a> earlier this year and the state’s independent power grid failed, many people <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-cold-snap-outage-193054181.html"><ins>couldn’t use their phones</ins></a> to access the internet and get information about the situation as it developed. Climate change is making those types of previously once in a lifetime weather events a more frequent occurrence and it’s forcing carriers to adapt.</p><p>On Tuesday, Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) introduced the <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-frontline-unveils-thor">Tactical Humanitarian Operations Response (THOR) vehicle</a>. The carrier built THOR using a modified Ford F650 truck. The front of the vehicle has seats for a driver and five passengers, while the “command center” you see at the back has room for three individuals. THOR can bring 5G and satellite connectivity to an area where a natural disaster may have knocked network access out or there wasn’t any connectivity in the first place.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Verizon envisions THOR assisting first-responders and the military “under nearly any conditions,” be that wildfires out in California or following a hurricane in Florida, as just some examples. The company developed the prototype with help from the Pentagon’s NavalX and the SoCal TechBridge. Outside of connecting first-responders and military personnel, it also comes with a tethered drone that can be used for search and rescue operations and collecting information on a disaster.</p><p>This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a US carrier trot out an initiative like this.
