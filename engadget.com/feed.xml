Smartwatches have all but taken over the mainstream wearable space, but the humble fitness tracker remains an option for those who want a gadget to do one thing right all the time. Despite the headwinds, there are still a bunch of fitness bands out there to choose from. Engadget has tested many of them and picked out the best for most people.</p><h2>What do fitness trackers do best?</h2><p>The answer seems simple: Fitness trackers are best at monitoring exercise, be it a 10-minute walk around the block or that half marathon you’ve been diligently training for. Obviously, smartwatches can do that too, but there are some areas where fitness bands have the upper hand: focus, design, battery life and price.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When I say “focus,” I’m alluding to the fact that fitness trackers are made to track activity well; anything else is extra. They often don’t have the bells and whistles that smartwatches do, which could distract from their activity-tracking abilities. They also tend to have fewer sensors and internal components, which keeps them smaller and lighter. Fitness trackers are also a better option for those who just want a less conspicuous device on their wrists all day.</p><p>Battery life tends to be better on fitness trackers, too. While most smartwatches last one to two days on a single charge, fitness bands will last five days to one week — and that’s with all-day and all-night use.</p><p>When it comes to price, there’s no competition. Most worthwhile smartwatches start at $175 to $200, but you can get a solid fitness tracker starting at $70. Yes, more expensive bands exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space.</p><h2>When to get a smartwatch instead</h2><p>If you need a bit more from your wearable, you’ll likely want a smartwatch instead. There are things like on-watch apps, alerts and even more robust fitness features that smartwatches have and fitness trackers don’t. You can use one to control smart home appliances, set timers and reminders, check weather reports and more. Some smartwatches let you choose which apps you want to receive alerts from, and the options go beyond just call and text notifications.</p><p>But the extra fitness features are arguably the most important thing to think about when deciding between a fitness tracker and a smartwatch. The latter devices tend to be larger, giving them more space for things like GPS, barometers, onboard music storage and more. While you can find built-in GPS on select fitness trackers, it’s not common.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h3>Best overall: Fitbit Charge 5</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7aa23d72-1fb4-11ec-bbaf-4e7c2ddd9958" alt="Fitbit Charge 5 fitness tracker" data-uuid="e9ae33c2-cb2a-327c-9492-d769fe8b08c7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fitbit&#39;s Charge 5" href="https://amzn.to/3ax6MYI">Fitbit&#39;s Charge 5</a> has everything most people would want in a fitness tracker. First and foremost, it&#39;s not a smartwatch. That means it has a slightly lower profile on the wrist and lasts days on a single charge while tracking activity and sleep. It also has a full-color AMOLED display — a big improvement from the smaller, grayscale screen on last year&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Charge 4" href="https://amzn.to/3AE7BcR">Charge 4</a>. That display, along with a thinner design, make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-review-130043489.html">Charge 5</a> feel more premium than its predecessor.</p><p>But it also costs $180 — $30 more than the Charge 4 — and that&#39;s due in part to the design upgrades but also some additional features. The Charge 5 has EDA sensors for stress tracking and it will eventually support ECG measurements and Daily Readiness Scores (the latter is for only for Premium subscribers). Those are on top of existing features that were carried over from the Charge 4 — most notably, Fitbit Pay support and built-in GPS. The former lets you pay for coffee or groceries with a swipe of your wrist, while the latter helps map outdoor runs, bike rides and other activities. Built-in GPS remains the star of the show here — it&#39;s fast and accurate, making the Charge 5 the best option if you want a do-it-all wearable that’s focused on fitness.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ax6MYI" id="d1ca259d593643fdb9f4308e6ea3981a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Charge 5 at Amazon - $180</a><h3>Alternative: Garmin Vivosmart 4</h3><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/b4cf0fe0-9ad2-11ea-afff-9457f212280b" alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4 fitness tracker."><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>A more subtle-looking alternative is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:$100 Garmin Vivosmart 4" href="https://amzn.to/3bXCFek">$100 Garmin Vivosmart 4</a>. It’s thinner than the Charge 5 and fits in a bit better with bracelets and other jewelry you might wear regularly. But its attractive design is only part of its appeal — Garmin knows how to track fitness, and the Vivosmart 4 is proof that you don’t need to drop hundreds on one of the company’s fitness watches to get a capable device.</p><p>Like the Charge 5, the Vivosmart 4 tracks all-day activity and sleep and has a pulse ox sensor for blood oxygen saturation measurements. It has only connected GPS capabilities, and it has universal music controls that can control the playback of most anything. The band is also waterproof and can track basic swim workouts, plus it also has a battery life of up to seven days. While it’s similar to the Charge 5 in that the Vivosmart 4 works with both Android and iOS devices, it’s a bit more flexible as it syncs with Apple Health (the Charge 5 and other Fitbit devices do not).</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3bXCFek" id="f778f223975c4829ae1a977f02e45f03" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Vivosmart 4 at Amazon - $130</a><h3>Best budget: Fitbit Inspire 2</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d3f0ff0-8b10-11eb-aaad-d9712ec51fcb" alt="A smartphone with the Tile app and a black Fitbit are shown against a dark grey background."><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fitbit / Tile</div></figure><p>If you only have $100 to spare, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fitbit Inspire 2" href="https://amzn.to/2XZ8Eqi">Fitbit Inspire 2</a> is the best option. It strips out all the luxury features from the Charge 5 and keeps only the essentials. You won’t get built-in GPS, Fitbit Pay or Spotify control but you do get excellent activity tracking, automatic workout detection, smartphone alerts and plenty more. As the updated version of the Inspire HR, the Inspire 2 includes a heart rate monitor, which the device uses to keep track of all-day heart rate, active zone minutes, sleep stages and more.</p><p>The Inspire HR is thinner than the Charge 5 but it also has interchangeable bands, so you can switch up its style whenever you feel like it. Its design is also swimproof, and it should last up to 10 days on a single charge. Fitbit also recently added Tile-tracking to the Inspire 2, allowing you to find your misplaced band using the Bluetooth locator feature and the Tile mobile app. All of these features make it the best value fitness tracker you can get.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2XZ8Eqi" id="6251817b585f46ec89595360bea1021f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Inspire 2 at Fitbit - $100</a><h3>Alternative: Samsung Galaxy Fit 2</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/38b0a5e0-ed57-11ea-b3fa-b00fd774f28d" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit 2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:$60 Samsung Galaxy Fit 2" href="https://amzn.to/3vAtCHS">$60 Samsung Galaxy Fit 2</a> band is almost like a more affordable Garmin Vivosmart 4. The two trackers share the same skeletal design but the Galaxy Fit looks a bit more utilitarian — you can swap out its bands, though — something you can’t do on Garmin’s device.</p><p>We haven’t given the Fit 2 the full review treatment, but Engadget’s Cherlynn Low was impressed with the original Galaxy Fit: the Tizen-based interface is colorful and easy to use, and plenty of people will appreciate its durable, no-nonsense design. It tracks a bunch of workouts as well and even has auto-exercise recognition. That’s on top of its daily activity tracking and sleep monitor, all of which uses the built-in heart rate monitor to collect pulse data throughout the day.</p><p>The kicker for the Galaxy Fit 2 is battery life — the tiny tracker can last for up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-fit-2-announcement-202152684.html">15 days</a> on a single charge, and you can even extend it to 21 days if you change some settings. That’s much longer than most competing bands, so even if Samsung isn’t as comprehensive as Garmin or Fitbit is when it comes to fitness data collection and analysis, the Galaxy Fit 2 is a good option for those who want a basic tracker that they can safely forget to charge each night.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3vAtCHS" id="e23d4754b63442e3a65884849113b56e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Fit 2 at Amazon - $60</a><h3>Most fashionable: Withings Move</h3><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/3c14bb30-9ad3-11ea-bfff-f779e183b4b4" alt="Withings Move fitness tracker."><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>All of the previously mentioned fitness trackers are attractive in their own way (bonus points to those that have interchangeable bands), but they share a similar look.

It’s an analog watch with a couple of health monitoring features including step, calorie, distance and sleep tracking, connected GPS, auto-recognition for more than 30 workouts and a water-resistant design. But we really love it for its button-cell battery, which can last up to 18 months before needing a replacement.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3BOb6Py" id="d2b0ea86024142fca4c5fa82870d2943" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Withings Move at Amazon - $70</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ad1be40-0a29-3f30-89c3-c8f1a9034ccf</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:05:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634223910</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T15:05:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[news]]></category><category><![CDATA[fitnesstrackers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Withings]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[wearables]]></category><category><![CDATA[Samsung]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitbit]]></category><category><![CDATA[Garmin]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7aa28b90-1fb4-11ec-bbff-102b321bbc00" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7aa28b90-1fb4-11ec-bbff-102b321bbc00" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fitbit Charge 5 fitness tracker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fitbit Charge 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HTC’s Vive Flow is a $499 lightweight VR headset built for entertainment and wellness]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HTC is today launching a lightweight headset designed to split the difference between a standalone VR headset and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtwear-g-wearable-display-140057578.html">personal cinema</a>. The HTC Vive Flow is a pair of glasses weighing just 189 grams (6.6 pounces) which pair with a smartphone to let you play some VR content or simply watch TV. It’s marketed as both a piece of tech to keep you entertained and a device to help you improve your mental wellbeing.</p><p>Naturally, the company doesn’t want to talk too much about the technology inside Flow, preferring to focus on what it can do. What we do know, however, is that it has two “1.6K” displays running at a 75Hz refresh rate and offering a 100-degree field of vision. There’s no battery per-se, except for a tiny cell designed to make sure that it’ll shut down safely if Flow is severed from whatever power source you&#39;ve connected its USB-C cable to.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/35a60a60-2c2c-11ec-bef7-432109a2163d" alt="Image of the HTC Flow and its hard carrying case" data-uuid="49e9936a-fdbe-351b-980c-b02d65f09b54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HTC</div></figure><p>It’s in this regard that it’s set up more like a personal cinema than it is your standard VR headset, especially with the fairly narrow body. HTC spent a lot of time and effort shrinking the distance between the display and your eyes, and Flow uses a pair of diopter lenses up front. It means that short-sighted folks won’t need to wear their glasses when using Flow, since they can set the lenses up to suit their comfort level.</p><p>To ensure that Flow really is portable, HTC set a power budget of 7.5 watts, the upper limit for USB 3’s charging spec. It means you can run this thing off any compatible battery pack (or your phone, in a pinch) as well as a standard socket over a USB-C cable. Some of that juice goes to powering a small active fan in front of the nose, which pulls cold air over your face and pushes warm air out of the Flow’s top vents.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5c69e630-2c2c-11ec-8a7d-1011f9140487" alt="Promotional image for the HTC Vive Flow" data-uuid="beda1b78-c99d-3204-82d3-7fddc9e1f29e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HTC</div></figure><p>HTC also spent plenty of time talking about how the dual-hinge system will ensure that the Flow’s glasses-like frame will sit comfortably on anyone’s head. A pair of speakers embedded into the arms offer what we’re told is surprisingly high quality spatial audio, and beefy given their relative size. And since they sit on your head like regular glasses, you can wear them laying down should the need arise.</p><p>You can pair Flow with your smartphone over Bluetooth or Miracast (for watching protected content) and use the phone as a pointer inside VR content. That limits the number of experiences you’ll be able to enjoy with the gear, but you were hardly going to be able to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html"><em>Half Life: Alyx</em></a> on this thing anyway. A pair of camera lenses facing forward will, when the feature is ready, enable the Flow to track your hands for more immersive VR, too.</p><p>It&#39;s worth saying that this is not, and as I understand it, can never become an AR headset in its current form. Those lenses don&#39;t apparently offer much passthrough (beyond what&#39;s necessary for motion tracking) and this isn&#39;t designed for it anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>HTC says that the focus of Flow’s content on “wellbeing, brain training, productivity” and “light gaming,” with apps like <em>Color Connect VR</em>, <em>Space Slurpies</em> and VR meditation app <em>Tripp</em>. The headset will be able to access a special version of Viveport Infinity, offering a wide library of Flow-compatible content for a monthly fee of $5.99. The company added that if users wanted to meditate within the Flow towards the end of the day, a blue light filter will kick in to help ensure that you can get more restful sleep.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ae1d4620-2c2c-11ec-b9de-282854ccb5c7" alt="Image of the Diopter Lenses on the back of an HTC Vive Flow" data-uuid="fdb30deb-7d6e-3129-839b-4235c390625f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HTC</div></figure><p>If you’re looking to get hold of an HTC Vive Flow, then pre-orders are opening from today, with shipping expected to begin in November. The price is $499, and for that you get the glasses and a soft carrying case thrown-in, but I’d strongly advise you to pre-order if you want one. Doing so entitles you to receive the flask-like hard carrying case, as well as seven pieces of additional VR content thrown in gratis.</p><p>Naturally, Flow has become something of a worst-kept secret in technology after many of these <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-flow-headset-images-leak-050326367.html">details were leaked ahead of time</a>. One of the obvious sticking points is the higher price compared to the Quest 2, although HTC was clear to dispel the notion that the products were equals. Flow, after all, is a not a standalone headset, and HTC believes that the lighter, more elegant hardware will win it fans in the health and fitness market.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-flow-lightweight-vr-headset-150014421.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5fde36c0-3cc3-472e-976e-08d9eaecb658</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634205007</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T09:50:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7adf6780-2c2b-11ec-affe-342a18f49884" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7adf6780-2c2b-11ec-affe-342a18f49884" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HTC]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Promotional image of the HTC Flow being used for meditation.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Flow]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[What to expect from Apple’s October 18th ‘Unleashed’ event]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-unleashed-macbook-pro-event-date-161136786.html"><ins>On October 18th</ins></a>, Apple will hold its second event of the fall and likely last event of the year.

Apple will reportedly turn back the clock on its flagship laptop, undoing many of the design features that have defined the line since late 2016. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-2021-macbook-pro-may-mark-the-return-of-the-mag-safe-connector-091548032.html"><ins>MagSafe</ins></a> may be back on the table, as well as an HDMI port and SD card slot. Oh, and the Touch Bar will apparently get the axe, with a standard set of function keys set to replace the OLED strip.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Beyond those changes, the new MacBook Pro is expected to feature thinner bezels. According to display analyst Ross Young, it could even come with a mini-LED panel capable of refreshing its screen at 120Hz. Ross suggests that’s a feature both models could include, but knowing Apple, it may be something that’s only available on the top-tier 16-inch model or an add-on that costs extra. Additionally, there have been reports of the 14- and 16-inch models supporting maximum resolutions of 3,024 x 1,964 and 3,456 x 2,224, which would be a major upgrade over the current 13- and 16-inch MacBook Pros.</p><div id="d3aa476fb791429ea70b3813a8048251"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, new 14&quot; and 16&quot; MacBook Pro&#39;s will have miniLEDs and we believe they will also be 120Hz refresh.</p>— Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1447967733971398665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Internally, the MacBook Pro will reportedly include Apple’s latest system-on-a-chip, possibly called the M1X.

In addition to delivering faster performance than the M1, the new chip could come with support for up to 32GB of RAM, making it a much better fit for work like coding and video editing.</p><p>Speaking of the M1X, it could tie into the other announcements Apple has planned for October 18th. In August, Gurman said Apple was working on a redesigned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m-1-x-rumor-194549101.html"><ins>Mac mini</ins></a> that will include the new processor and add additional ports. At the time, he noted the desktop would launch sometime within the “next several months.” Recent reports suggest that a new Mac mini isn’t a guarantee for next week, but Apple could still surprise us. We know from Gurman and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that Apple is also working on a redesigned MacBook Air, but the company reportedly won’t announce that device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/kuo-macbook-air-mass-production-third-quarter/">until sometime next year</a>.</p><h2>macOS Monterey</h2><h2></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/163fd870-da94-11eb-9fdf-182584dd7911" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="macOS Monterey Facetime Shareplay" data-uuid="791bda7b-5cb8-379e-a721-0396b520f4bb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Given the timing of the event and the likely focus on Mac hardware, Apple will almost certainly announce a release date for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macos-monterey-182454905.html"><ins>macOS Monterey</ins></a>. The company previewed the next version of its desktop operating system at WWDC 2021, showing how features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-delays-ios-15-shareplay-184450766.html"><ins>SharePlay</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-universal-control-ipad-macbook-imac-184045949.html"><ins>Universal Control</ins></a> will build on the enhancements it introduced with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-big-sur-review-180036335.html"><ins>Big Sur</ins></a> in 2020. We got a chance to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html"><ins>preview the update</ins></a> this past summer and found it was a mostly subtle upgrade to Apple’s desktop OS. Still, we wager Mac fans will be excited to find out when they can download the software.</p><h2>Everything else</h2><h2></h2><p>We could also see the company announce a new set of AirPods to replace the current <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-03-apple-airpods-review-2019-more-of-the-same.html"><ins>second-generation model</ins></a>. Apple hasn’t updated its original wireless earbuds since 2019 when it released a minor update that added support for inductive charging. Taking a page from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html"><ins>AirPods Pro</ins></a>, the new model is expected to feature an updated design with shorter stems, but they won’t include more premium features like ANC. In the lead-up to next week’s event, we’ve seen leaked images of the third-generation AirPods with both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-generation-leak-205121774.html"><ins>silicone ear tips and without</ins></a>. So it’s not clear just how heavily Apple plans to lean into the AirPods Pro design.</p><p>We’ll note here AirPods haven’t been a frequent feature of Apple’s hardware events. Outside of when it unveiled the earbuds back in 2016, Apple has announced all subsequent models, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-28-apple-airpods-pro-announced-active-noise-cancellation.html"><ins>AirPods Pro</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airdpods-studio-announced-specs-pricing-133623490.html"><ins>AirPods Max</ins></a>, through press releases. We can see the company doing the same here with the new “basic” model. One last thing the company could mention at the event is that Apple Music is coming to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-14-it-looks-like-apple-music-may-be-coming-to-playstation-5"><ins>PlayStation 4 and PS5</ins></a>. Given that you can already access <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-app-playstation-4-5-launch-availability-113246540.html"><ins>Apple TV from Sony’s consoles</ins></a>, it’s not a jump for the streaming service to become available there as well.</p><p>So there you have it, that’s everything we see Apple potentially sharing on October 18th. As always, the company could surprise us, so you’ll want to visit Engadget on the day of the event. We’ll have comprehensive coverage of the company’s latest announcements.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-what-to-expect-october-18-unleashed-142518973.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a0e2422b-e193-49a7-959d-8bb796f9ac53</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 14:25:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634221675</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T14:28:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d37e0460-3eeb-11eb-b7f9-449e864b9135" width="1957" height="1213" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d37e0460-3eeb-11eb-b7f9-449e864b9135" width="1957" height="1213" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's latest MacBook Pro with an M1 chip.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Monument Valley 2’ gets a new chapter four years after its debut]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Four years after <em>Monument Valley 2</em> hit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-05-monument-valley-2-available-on-ios-now.html"><ins>iOS</ins></a> and <a href="http://html/"><ins>Android</ins></a>, Ustwo Games has added a new chapter.

Star Trek has been described as “competence porn” by many online, in how it depicts people who are insanely good at their jobs and work together well.</p><p>The first two seasons haven’t always showcased the crew at their finest. We’ve seen Boimler and Mariner lose the Klingon diplomat they were supposed to be escorting, Freeman get into a pissing match with the captain of another Starfleet vessel, and the crew fail its (rigged) assessment test <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-eight-132048849.html">spectacularly</a>. At times the show is very much like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Peacock;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:The Office" href="https://fave.co/3p0RCnc"><em>The Office</em></a>, more interested in the personal lives and antics of its employees than the actual business at hand.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/87bb5510-2c5b-11ec-a3b3-b0c1472d91e9" data-uuid="d5b031d9-7c14-36be-bff2-32e8861c873c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>However, even <em>The Office</em> would occasionally remind you that the staff of Dunder Mifflin were good at their jobs, particularly Michael Scott. Michael was a terrible manager, but one hell of a salesman. And this episode of <em>Lower Decks</em> put the spotlight on Carol Freeman, whose fine work over the past two years is being rewarded with a promotion to a better ship. The <em>USS Cerritos</em> is a California-class ship, a real workhorse of a vessel that doesn’t get a lot of respect. That the <em>Cerritos</em> even became important at all is completely due to circumstance in encountering and surviving the newly empowered Pakleds. But it’s given Freeman a lot of time in the spotlight, with her tasked <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-six-130040781.html">a few episodes ago</a> with negotiating a cease-fire with the Pakled government. (It was a ruse, but that’s not her fault.)</p><p>Last week I thought this episode would wrap up that storyline, given that we now know the Pakleds were getting help from a Klingon captain, one who is no longer alive thanks to the actions of a lower-decker. Instead, this episode focuses on Freeman’s possible promotion, her senior staff’s reaction to it, and the futures of our lower decks ensigns.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9eca58f0-2c5b-11ec-8eff-e34a6827c4bf" data-uuid="6aea66cf-ea15-3bc5-bb15-f59c4e9648c9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>This is all happening against the backdrop of a first contact mission. The <em>USS Cerritos</em> mostly specializes in second contact missions — we’re told this in the very first episode. That means they come in and handle all the annoying administrative stuff after flagships like the <em>Enterprise</em> come in and establish initial relations. Now, the <em>Cerritos</em> gets to take part in the more important <em>first</em> impression, but only as backup to the <em>USS Archimedes</em>.</p><p>Sitting on the bench ends up serving the <em>Cerritos</em> well when a solar flare plus an unstable planetoid ends up disabling the <em>Archimedes</em> and putting it on a crash course with the planet below. Freeman is ready to sacrifice herself in order to save the other ship, but Rutherford and company have a better plan, one that can prevent fatalities on both vessels. But they’ve only got 20 hours, so the whole crew has to chip in. That means Ransom piloting, Billups supervising the hull removal, and Tendi giving Mariner a much-needed pep talk. The latter might not be necessary to the functioning of the ship, but it is important to the show because it pushes the two women toward the emotional resolution they need.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/52d72e90-2c5c-11ec-b79d-f78ef28c8970" data-uuid="b79e5e9d-7e4f-311b-814f-94ae5add132d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>We also get to meet the crew of cetacean ops, two beluga whale lieutenants named Kimolu and Matt. But it’s Boimler who has to save the day, because the clamp they need to release isn’t made to be turned by flippers. (I really appreciate the accessibility joke here, because Starfleet has often been cited over the decades as an OSHA nightmare.) Needless to say, the crew succeeds (this isn’t <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_III:_The_Search_for_Spock">a movie</a>, <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Generations">after all</a>, so we’re not <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek_Beyond">losing the ship</a>). After the bravery shown by the entire crew of the <em>Cerritos</em>, particularly Boimler and Rutherford, it’s hard to imagine that season three won’t start off with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-nine-130037874.html">a few promotions</a>.</p><p>But first, there’s the matter of Freeman’s transfer, which she has decided to decline in favor of staying with a crew that has proven itself capable of being truly excellent. Unfortunately, that Pakled storyline comes to bite us all one more time, leading us into the show’s very first cliffhanger, and the very first season-ending cliffhanger in the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cbs-alex-kurtzman-star-trek-deal-165454180.html">Kurtzman-era</a> of Trek programs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cd664340-2c5b-11ec-9fb1-c9505d21fef7" data-uuid="8b66e319-927f-30c8-a141-43fa2772693a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> had a lot to prove when it debuted last year: It was the first animated show since the ‘70s, and the franchise’s first attempt at a primarily comedic series. It also had to overcome the initial impressions of it as being akin to <em>Rick and Morty </em>or <em>Family Guy</em>. The quality of the first season started a bit rough but improved as time went on, ending on the fantastic action-packed episode, “No Small Parts.” Season two’s “First First Contact” ups the game in several ways, not just in its element of danger but also in how the show is willing to use big storylines to push the characters forward as the seasons progress.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-ten-first-first-contact-130034227.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">40be6aa8-28a3-4c91-9c2b-257f6721fe59</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 13:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634154430</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T19:47:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/317f9160-2c5c-11ec-96d7-940ee0f88cc7" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/317f9160-2c5c-11ec-96d7-940ee0f88cc7" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["First First Contact" -- Epi#210 --  Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner and Lauren Lapkus as Jennifer the Andorian of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

In a statement, the company said that it had recruited 13 universities across nine countries, who had collected 2,200 hours of footage from 700 participants. This footage was taken from the perspective of the user, which can be used to train these future AI models. Kristen Grauman, Facebook’s lead research scientist, says that this is the largest collection of data explicitly created for this focus.</p><p>The footage was centered on a number of common experiences in human life, including social interaction, hand and object manipulation and predicting what’s going to happen. It’s, as far as the social network is concerned, a big step toward better computing experiences which, until now, have always focused on sourcing data from the bystander’s perspective. Facebook has said that the data sets will be released in November, “for researchers who sign Ego4D’s data use agreement.” And, next year, researchers from beyond this community will be challenged to better train machines to understand what exactly humans are doing in their lives.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, there is the angle that Facebook, which now has a camera glasses partnership with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-hands-on-160048150.html">Ray Ban</a>, is looking to improve its own capabilities in future.

Between this device and its smaller 5-inch sibling, it received more upgrades from the previous generation, including a faster octa-core processor. It also has a 13-megapixel wide-angle camera that&#39;s a huge improvement over the previous version&#39;s one-megapixel sensor. The smart display uses digital panning and zooming to follow you around during calls, and it worked well enough when we tested it out. It even works with every video calling platform the device supports, including Skype and Zoom.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from its faster processor and better camera, we praised the Echo Show 8 for its minimalist design and its 1,280 x 800-pixel resolution display. It lacks the 3.5 mm jack of its predecessor that will let you connect it to a speaker, but it already has a powerful bass and impressive volume. The device&#39;s overall sound quality is also better than its smaller sibling&#39;s, since it has two speakers instead of one.&nbsp;</p><p>We found the Echo Show 8 a great digital photo frame that&#39;s capable of displaying current time and weather conditions during our tests. In addition, we found it helpful in the kitchen, thanks to its large library of recipes with step-by-step instructions from sources that include the <em>Food Network</em> and <em>Allrecipes. </em>And in case you want to use the smart display to watch videos, you can do so, as well, since it supports video streaming from Amazon Prime, Netflix and Hulu.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-100-deal-113512009.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eaacdba4-175e-4b3e-abaa-4e46dc11c1f6</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 11:35:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634209166</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T10:59:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/32763c10-2ccd-11ec-bdef-ac95ca51e4c2" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/32763c10-2ccd-11ec-bdef-ac95ca51e4c2" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nicole Lee / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 8]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 8]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Apple Watch Series 7, reviewed]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple still dominates the world of wearables.

It&#39;s a welcome and much overdue change, opening up the educational possibilities of Pocket Gallery to far more people.</p><p>Google Arts &amp; Culture has other virtual experiences, including <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/project/360-videos">360-degree videos and more</a>. Along with the update, Google also unveiled a <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/pocketgallery/qAURWqbxXZuImw">new exhibition</a> in the collection done in collaboration with <em>Réunion des musées nationaux - Grand Palais</em> in France.

According to a paper in the journal <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03869-6"><em>Nature</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-04-01-zombie-white-dwarf-dying-star.html">white dwarf</a> star and planet around 6,500 light years away provides a preview of what will happen to our own solar system in approximately 5 billion years.&nbsp;</p><p>When a yellow dwarf star like our sun exhausts its helium supply, it expands into a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-30-detailed-image-of-gruis-red-giant-confirms-theory.html">red giant</a> and incinerates its inner planets (bye-bye, Earth, Mars, Venus and Mercury). It then contracts from its own gravity into a white dwarf, a dim Earth-sized star with about half its original mass. Though the fate of inner planets is sealed, scientists aren&#39;t exactly sure what happens to planets farther away, like Jupiter and Uranus.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5c880e327dcd4bb3b0bd6d880bacad03"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/eQaLfSE" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Using the Keck II telescope at the W. M. Keck observatory in Hawai&#39;i, a team of researchers spotted a planet around 1.4 times the size of Jupiter orbiting a dim white dwarf star (about 60 percent the size of the Sun) in a Jupiter-like orbit. They discovered it using a technique called gravitational microlensing (thanks, Einstein), possible when a target and a nearer star align with Earth. The nearer star bends the light from the subject, allowing scientists to observe it with a telescope.</p><p>The team tried to find the planet&#39;s associated star, but eventually concluded that it must be a white dwarf too faint to directly observe. Scientists previously discovered a different Jupiter-like planet around a white dwarf, but its orbit was much closer — so it wasn&#39;t a great analog to our own solar system.&nbsp;</p><p>The finding indicates that planets with wide orbits are probably more common than inner planets. It also shows that some of our solar system&#39;s worlds may survive the Sun&#39;s death. &quot;Earth’s future may not be so rosy because it is much closer to the Sun,” co-author David Bennett said in a statement. &quot;If humankind wanted to move to a moon of Jupiter or Saturn before the Sun fried the Earth during its red supergiant phase, we’d still remain in orbit around the Sun, although we would not be able to rely on heat from the Sun as a white dwarf for very long.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/planet-orbiting-a-dead-star-previews-the-fate-of-our-own-solar-system-091015077.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7369a91-8e2e-4915-835f-a93b3a3e8a82</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 09:10:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634202567</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T09:09:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1d684710-2cc7-11ec-bffb-fe281a508c2f" width="2560" height="1557" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1d684710-2cc7-11ec-bffb-fe281a508c2f" width="2560" height="1557" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[W.

It was only supposed to last for two years after the buds were first sold in October 30th, 2019, which means the program was going to come to a close in a couple of weeks. As first noticed by someone on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/q7kov9/psa_apple_silently_extended_the_airpods_pro/">Reddit</a>, though, the tech giant has quietly updated its program&#39;s information page to extend its availability. &quot;The program covers affected AirPods Pro for 3 years after the first retail sale of the unit,&quot; the <a href="https://support.apple.com/airpods-pro-service-program-sound-issues">updated page</a> reads, giving people the chance to exchange their faulty buds within the next year.</p><p>Apple previously said that a &quot;small percentage&quot; of units manufactured before October 2020 may be affected by the issue. The program covers buds exhibiting cracking or static sounds in loud environments, or while the user is exercising or talking on the phone. It also covers units with faulty Active Noise Cancellation that show irregularities, such as the loss of bass or an increase in background sounds. According to a few <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/q7kov9/psa_apple_silently_extended_the_airpods_pro/">commenters</a> on the Reddit post, however, even their buds that were manufactured later than October 2020 were exhibiting sound issues. While those models are technically not covered by the program anymore, the users were still able to get them replaced by getting in touch with Apple.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-extends-repair-program-crackling-air-pods-pro-081854549.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">85c498c9-eeb1-433b-aab6-23d03349642a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 08:18:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634199540</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T08:19:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/62418e60-2cbc-11ec-bfa6-6c3a5ccd6654" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/62418e60-2cbc-11ec-bfa6-6c3a5ccd6654" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volvo reveals its first vehicle made of fossil-free steel]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago, Volvo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-cars-fossil-free-steel-142019740.html">teamed up</a> with Swedish steel producer SSAB to develop a type of steel it can use for its vehicles that doesn&#39;t use fossil fuels. Now, the automaker has <a href="https://www.ssab.com/news/2021/10/ssabs-fossilfree-steel-featured-in-volvo-groups-vehicle">revealed</a> what it says is the world&#39;s first vehicle made of fossil-free steel: A four wheeled fully electric load carrier made for quarrying and mining. In addition to having no greenhouse gas emission, it&#39;s also autonomous and can follow a pre-programmed route to transport materials at a job site.</p><div id="57fea85c64de4b4bbaba68608ac677ec"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UZ1XXXvnwU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>SSAB produces fossil-free steel by replacing the coal used during the manufacturing process with hydrogen from electrolysis. As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2021/10/13/this-is-the-worlds-first-fossil-free-steel-vehicle-autonomous-electric-and-a-volvo/?sh=44ad69c57a68"><em>Forbes</em></a> notes, though, the whole vehicle isn&#39;t exactly fossil-free, since the steel used for its components provided by third-party suppliers, such as its electric motor, were made using traditional means. Still, Volvo Group CTO Lars Stenqvist told the publication that &quot;majority of the steel&quot; in the vehicle is fossil free. He said three tons of the carrier&#39;s 8.2-ton weight is made of green steel from SSAB, and those eight tons include other heavy components like the vehicle&#39;s tires.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Volvo plans to start a small-scale production for the vehicle next year and to scale up production, depending on the availability of steel from SSAB. The Swedish manufacturer is hoping to start mass-producing its fossil-free steel in 2026, so we may see more Volvo vehicles made using the material by that time.</p><p>Martin Lundstedt, President and CEO Volvo Group, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This initiative with SSAB sets the benchmark for a fossil-free future. Just as the nations of the world come together at COP26 to address climate change, so too must organizations and industries work in collaboration to develop innovative new solutions for a greenhouse gas emission free future. Volvo Group is committed to pioneering partnerships such as this with SSAB to develop attractive, safe and efficient new vehicles and machines that pave the way for a more sustainable transport and infrastructure system adopted for the future.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/volvo-first-vehicle-fossil-free-steel-055542393.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">33db3fbd-b517-4bc7-8541-7fa15aca126a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 05:55:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634215158</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T12:39:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/35b64780-2caf-11ec-b5af-c36e4b669756" width="1600" height="1018" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/35b64780-2caf-11ec-b5af-c36e4b669756" width="1600" height="1018" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Volvo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Volvo]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Volvo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook’s latest effort to curtail leaks immediately leaked]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is ramping up its fight against leakers following the disclosures of whistleblower Frances Haugen.

The company is making some internal groups private, and will remove employees “whose work isn’t related to safety and security,” according to the report. “Sensitive Integrity discussions will happen in closed, curated forums in the future,” the company told employees in a memo.</p><p>On one hand, the fact that news of the change immediately leaked would seem to back up that the company is in fact more leaky than it has been in years past. But it could also signal increasing unrest among employees, some of whom are reportedly concerned that walling off teams that work on important issues could ultimately do more harm than good.</p><p>It also underscores just how much Facebook is still reeling from Haugen’s disclosures. In addition to the Senate hearing last week, Haugen is expected <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/tech/facebook-whistleblower-january-6-select-committee/index.html"><ins>to brief</ins></a> the select committee investigating the Jan. 6th insurrection, as well as <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-whistleblower-to-be-invited-to-eu-parliament/"><ins>European lawmakers</ins></a> investigating the company.

While that&#39;s something that will make fixing the OLED Switch on your own more difficult, iFixit suspects it could help with WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity issues.</p><p>Speaking of repairability, iFixit gave the OLED model a score of seven out of 10. That’s one less than the company awarded the original model. The OLED Switch features a non-modular storage module that’s soldered to its motherboard, making easy repairs and upgrades on that front something you can’t do.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-oled-teardown-210513147.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">22f59da5-db57-4c7b-82e9-772fb6611199</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 21:05:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634158633</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T20:57:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/281ba730-2c66-11ec-b7ff-712c08a13ad4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/281ba730-2c66-11ec-b7ff-712c08a13ad4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch OLED]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch OLED]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter's Spaces Spark Program will pay creators to broadcast live audio]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has launched a new three-month accelerator program to help up-and-coming Spaces creators.

But according to <a href="https://drewmcweeny.substack.com/p/what-the-hell-is-voir">writer and film critic Drew McWeeny</a>, who&#39;s working on one episode of the series, VOIR will feature standalone explorations about different aspects of movies.&nbsp;</p><div id="978ce756f0454e58b5ea082b28252426"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">From executive producer David Fincher…<br><br>VOIR, a new documentary series of visual essays celebrating cinema, from the mind of one of film’s modern masters.<br><br>Premiering at AFI Fest and coming soon to Netflix. <a href="https://t.co/gqHqlvbxZF">pic.twitter.com/gqHqlvbxZF</a></p>— NetflixFilm (@NetflixFilm) <a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixFilm/status/1448351600473411588?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>&quot;We’re not trying to sell you anything, and we’re not interviewing anyone about what Marvel movies they’re doing,&quot; McWeeny <a href="https://drewmcweeny.substack.com/p/what-the-hell-is-voir">wrote in his newsletter, Formerly Dangerous</a><em>. &quot;</em>We’re each tackling a totally different idea, something that intrigues us or upsets us or that has to do with our connection to the movies.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Much like <em>Love, Death and Robots</em>, the animated sci-fi series from Fincher and Tim Miller (<em>Deadpool</em>), VOIR episodes will range from 10 to 30 minutes.

Now, streamers and their trusted helper will be able to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-continued-fight-against-hate-and-harassment">temporarily mute people for minutes</a>, hours or the length of an entire livestream. According to Eric Han, head of Tiktok&#39;s US Safety team, muting a person will remove their entire comment history from the stream. And of course, you could also just turn off comments entirely or filter out specific keywords. Together with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-live-stream-kindness-discovery-tools-133912505.html">Tiktok&#39;s last batch of &quot;kindness&quot; updates </a>for livestreamers, the platform is aiming to create a safer environment for creators.</p><p>Han says the prompts TikTok added in July — which pop up to make you think twice about posting an &quot;unkind or harmful&quot; comment — have led almost 40 percent of people editing or withdrawing their comment entirely. That&#39;s not too surprising, as Twitter found a similar feature also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-anti-bullying-prompts-expansion-173049219.html">led to reduced bullying</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Given Tiktok&#39;s meteoric rise as a relatively young social network, it&#39;s apparently learned quite a bit from the struggles of older outfits like Facebook and Twitter. Based on its Q2 <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/tiktok-transparency-report-2021-q-2?lang=en">Community Guidelines Enforcement Report</a>, the company says it&#39;s also getting better at weeding out improper videos. Han says 73.3 percent of harassment videos were removed before there were any user reports, whereas that figure was 66.2 percent in the previous quarter. Similarly, 72.9 percent of videos showing hateful behavior were removed in the second quarter, compared to 67.3 percent previously.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-livestream-mute-temporary-harassment-184929315.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf7fb092-eeb9-4f03-bb59-4c505749554d</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:49:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634150384</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T18:39:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-02/2f6fe710-4ddf-11ea-b3ff-ca9d067be64b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-02/2f6fe710-4ddf-11ea-b3ff-ca9d067be64b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anatoliy Sizov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tyumen, Russia - January 21, 2020: TikTok and Facebook application  on screen Apple iPhone XR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TikTok and Facebook application  on screen Apple iPhone XR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A live-action 'System Shock' TV series is on the way]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nightdive Studios’ immersive sim franchise <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/system%20shock"><ins>System Shock</ins></a> franchise is being turned into a live-action TV show.
