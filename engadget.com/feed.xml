Just how powerful will these phones be? Will they represent a good value? And does Google have any surprises up its sleeve? Here&#39;s what you can expect from the presentation, including a few last-minute leaks.</p><h2><strong>The specs: A return to flagship phones</strong></h2><h3></h3><p>Unlike with past phone launches, Google has been happy to share basic details of the Pixel 6 family months in advance. Both the base Pixel 6 and the larger, brawnier Pixel 6 Pro will mark Google&#39;s return to high-end phones after the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html"> Pixel 5</a> &#39;break,&#39; with premium glass designs. They&#39;ll offer upgraded cameras with improved low-light performance (150 percent more light than in the past), and they should tout &quot;all day&quot; battery life despite support for battery-hungry 5G.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The centerpiece, however, will be the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html"> Tensor chip</a> inside both Pixel 6 models. Google hasn&#39;t officially divulged full specs for Tensor as of this writing, but it&#39;s the company&#39;s first custom system-on-chip. The design uses its namesake AI processing to achieve things that were &quot;previously impossible&quot; on typical SoCs, such as juggling multiple AI tasks or processing live video.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/66b4d530-2c47-11ec-b6ff-b422faa324cc" alt="Google Tensor chip inside Pixel 6" data-uuid="d42d876f-6dd8-316d-8660-c95f981d763d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>However, Google hasn&#39;t said much about the exact specs of the Pixel 6 line or the range of Tensor-assisted features. Expect the company to share many more gritty technical details for the Pixel 6 at the event, although we wouldn’t count on enough info to make easy comparisons between Tensor and rival mobile chips.</p><p>You might not have to wait long to get the full scoop. Well-known leaker Evan Blass<a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446818179636924419"> spotted</a> Carphone Warehouse promo pages that appear to spoil much of what Google intends to announce. The standard Pixel 6 will likely compete against &#39;entry&#39; flagships like the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html"> Galaxy S21</a> and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html"> iPhone 13</a> with a 6.4-inch flat 90Hz screen, a 50-megapixel main camera and a 12MP ultra-wide shooter. The Pixel 6 Pro, meanwhile, should be the definitive top-of-the-range model with a 6.7-inch curved 120Hz display and a third 48MP telephoto lens. You may also see 30W wired charging, 23W wireless charging and reverse charging to top up your earbuds or other phones.</p><p>As for Tensor? That retail listing claimed up to 80 percent better performance than the Pixel 5 (not difficult given the 5&#39;s middling<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-03-qualcomm-snapdragon-865-765.html"> Snapdragon 765G</a> chip), but the real star may be Tensor&#39;s photographic prowess. Google reportedly plans multiple AI-driven camera tricks that include a Magic Eraser to get rid of photobombers, Face Unblur to keep people in focus and a Motion Mode for action photography. These aren&#39;t completely novel concepts (anti-photobombing has been present in Huawei and Samsung phones for a while), but they&#39;re new to Pixels and might perform better with Tensor involved.</p><h2>A focus on services and support</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0e78bb60-2c4d-11ec-bcfc-ce631a8414bc" alt="Google Pixel 6 in peach at an angle" data-uuid="0fcfa6ee-54cb-3102-8d66-d37a9dd1b865"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google might also break new ground in <em>how</em> it sells the Pixel 6. <em>This is Tech Today</em>&#39;s M. Brandon Lee<a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1447248490321514500"> obtained</a> what he says is evidence Google will make the Pixel 6 available as a part of a &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-pass-for-pixel-6-pro-194143011.html">Pixel Pass</a>&quot; that combines monthly phone payments with an extended warranty,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-one-vpn-191231627.html"> Google One</a> cloud storage,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-23-android-app-subscription-service.html"> Play Pass</a>, optional Google Fi service and either YouTube Music or YouTube Premium. Effectively, Google would counter<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-one-subscription-bundle-apple-music-apple-tv-plus-announced-174601467.html"> Apple One</a> by including virtually everything you need in a single subscription, not just internet services.</p><p>You could also enjoy better software support regardless of what you pay. Those Carphone Warehouse pages echoed longstanding rumors that Google would offer &quot;at least&quot; five years of security updates to Pixel 6 owners. That&#39;s more than the three to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-four-years-security-updates-152303907.html"> four years</a> you often find in the Android world, and roughly on par with Apple. It&#39;s not clear if you&#39;ll get full operating system updates for those five years, but you might not have to worry about patchable vulnerabilities for the practical life of your Pixel.</p><h2>Price and release date</h2><h3></h3><p>There&#39;s little doubt the Pixel 6 will cost more than its predecessor. Where the Pixel 5 was an upper-mid-range phone, its sequel is an upscale device. Google has even made clear the Pixel 6 Pro will be a &quot;premium-priced product.&quot; But how much more will you have to pay?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f4bc2c40-2c63-11ec-bffd-0bd9f16468e3" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro colors" data-uuid="aa404728-7d68-3a3a-9211-7996af1922b9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>That&#39;s a difficult call. One Reddit user<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/q2qcge/official_price_of_the_pixel_6_649_in_germany_with/"> spotted</a> a German listing that mentioned a €649 (about $750) price for the base Pixel 6. A<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayOD9qDsSq0&amp;t=297s"> source</a> for <em>This is Tech Today</em>, meanwhile, quoted a price of €899 (roughly $1,050) for the 6 Pro. We&#39;d be cautious about these prices, as they could change and might not convert neatly even if they&#39;re accurate. Still, Google is apparently returning to top-tier pricing.</p><p>Like it or not, Google will also borrow a cost- and waste-cutting measure from its rivals: it&#39;s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-will-not-include-charger-200203294.html"> leaving the charger out of the box</a>. That&#39;s not too dire an omission when there&#39;s a real chance you&#39;ll have a USB-C charger hanging around, but it could be frustrating if you&#39;re either new to USB-C devices or saddled with a slow power brick. Factor that into the price before you rush to check out.</p><p>The German listing and other leaks have pointed to a Pixel 6 release sometime the week of October 25th. We&#39;d expect a broad international launch, for that matter. Where the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html"> Pixel 5a</a> was limited to the US and Japan due to supply constraints, the leaks so far already hint that Google wants to make the Pixel 6 as ubiquitous as possible.</p><h2><strong>Don&#39;t expect many surprises</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/074ce1b0-2c69-11ec-b3d1-d5e90fd89d5c" alt="Google Pixel 6 colors" data-uuid="31f08d5e-4a25-3c41-91fe-01197b5cfb8e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>We wouldn&#39;t bet on Google announcing much else besides the Pixel 6 and its accompanying software. Google&#39;s marketing for the event has revolved exclusively around its new phones. It&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ll see any other gadgets, and they&#39;ll definitely be secondary if they do appear.</p><p>That&#39;s not to completely rule out new hardware. It has been more than a year since Google debuted its<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-review-2020-160030712.html"> higher-end Pixel Buds</a>, and other devices like<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-google-nest-wifi-review.html"> Nest WiFi</a> haven&#39;t been updated in a while. There&#39;s just not much need for Google to revamp products beyond the Pixel line — what&#39;s there is still relevant and functional.</p><p>There&#39;s also the possibility of new or upgraded services. If Google really does introduce a Pixel Pass, it might want to sweeten the deal by offering more for the money, whether it&#39;s a brand new service or perks like more cloud storage. We haven&#39;t seen rumors to this effect so far, but Google also<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-free-unlimited-storage-ends-june-1st-114514222.html"> kept unlimited photo uploads</a> for Pixel owners when it capped everyone else in June. The company knows that services sell hardware, and that may be crucial for the Pixel 6.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-google-pixel-6-event-130025254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ed07266-c5cf-42dd-9baa-a0a0903ba796</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 13:00:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634304474</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T13:28:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/50fe6e70-ff8f-11eb-ba7f-37ef7ae7cec5" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/50fe6e70-ff8f-11eb-ba7f-37ef7ae7cec5" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro in multiple colors]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro in multiple colors]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon slashes up to 26 percent off monitors from Dell and LG]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:deal of the day" href="https://amzn.to/3mTgcnm">deal of the day</a> includes a bunch of monitors and Chromebooks on sale for up to 26 percent lower than their usual price. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Dell&#39;s 27-inch QHD curved gaming monitor" href="https://amzn.to/3j52pc6">Dell&#39;s 27-inch QHD curved gaming monitor</a>, for instance, will set you back $270, which is an all-time low for the product on the website.

In yesterday’s newsletter, I explained how Apple was thriving in the world of wearables, but not everyone wants so many notification pings and a watch that needs charging daily. There is still very much a place for simpler wearables, and as we’re approaching holiday season, most of them are also less pricey than the high-end options from Apple, Samsung and Garmin.</p><p>Fortunately, we have Valentina Palladino on staff. She’s written about wearables for years, even before joining the Engadget team. She&#39;s now laid out what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html https://www.engadget.com/...">fitness trackers are capable of in 2021</a> and whether you should go for one or shop around smartwatches instead.

According to <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/14/tesla-officially-launches-insurance-using-real-time-driving-behavior-texas/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, though, the insurance available to Texans is quite different than the one owners can get in The Golden State: It calculates for a customer&#39;s insurance premium using their real-time driving behavior. Their credit, age and gender that are typically used by other insurance providers apparently don&#39;t matter to Tesla. The automaker says it won&#39;t even look at customers&#39; claim history and driving records.</p><p>Instead, Tesla will look at their &quot;safety scores,&quot; which is a feature it introduced with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">Full Self-Driving Beta</a> version released in September. That could make things quite tricky, since the premium that needs to be paid can change every month based on the conditions the driver encounters on the road. Every forced collision warning and forced Autopilot disengagement will affect their score. Following other vehicles from an unsafe distance, braking too hard and turning corners aggressively could lower their score, as well. Safety score is still a beta feature at this point, and Tesla said it should improve over time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Owners can now <a href="https://www.tesla.com/insurance">apply for a quote</a>, wherein which the automaker will assume a 90 safety score to start their policy.

One of those changes is layered clothing, which it&#39;s been working on <a href="https://twitter.com/bloxy_news/status/1286711089883828225?lang=en">since at least 2020</a>. It allows any type of character model to be outfitted with layered clothing items. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/roblox-avatar-updates-rdc-2021/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> explains that the feature ensures clothing items will fit avatars and will drape around them naturally, whether they&#39;re human- or dinosaur-shaped.

Forkner, Boeing&#39;s former chief technical pilot involved in the company&#39;s 737 Max testing, was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-boeing-737-max-chief-technical-pilot-indicted-fraud">indicted</a> for fraud by a grand jury in Texas. Due to his position with the company, he was in charge of coordinating with the Federal Aviation Administration to determine the kind of training a pilot needs to fly a particular plane. The indictment <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/14/boeing-pilot-involved-in-737-max-jetliner-testing-is-indicted-in-texas-.html">accuses</a> him of deceiving the agency&#39;s Aircraft Evaluation Group (FAA AEG) when it evaluated and certified the 737 Max model. If you&#39;ll recall, two 737 Max planes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-12-boeing-software-update-737-max.html">crashed</a> within months of each other in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.</p><p>Forkner allegedly provided the FAA with &quot;materially false, inaccurate, and incomplete information about a new part of the flight controls for the Boeing 737 MAX called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).&quot; In both crashes, the AEG determined after an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-18-boeing-737-max-faa-certification-flaws.html">investigation</a> that MCAS, a system designed to push the plane&#39;s nose down in certain situations, activated during the flight. The planes that crashed — Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 — nosedived almost as soon as they took off.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the Department of Justice, Forkner discovered an important change to MCAS in November 2016, but he allegedly withheld that information from the AEG. As a result, the FAA removed all reference to MCAS in the pilot training materials for the 737 Max. Acting US Attorney Chad E. Meacham for the Northern District of Texas said in a statement that the former chief pilot&#39;s actions were financially motivated:</p><blockquote><p>“In an attempt to save Boeing money, Forkner allegedly withheld critical information from regulators. His callous choice to mislead the FAA hampered the agency’s ability to protect the flying public and left pilots in the lurch, lacking information about certain 737 MAX flight controls. The Department of Justice will not tolerate fraud — especially in industries where the stakes are so high.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Earlier this year, Boeing agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boeing-2-5-billion-conspiracy-charge-737-max-crashes-073650876.html">pay $2.5 billion</a> to settle the criminal charge that it had conspired to defraud the FAA. It also agreed to work with the FAA&#39;s fraud section for any ongoing and future investigations. As for Forkner, he was charged with two counts of fraud involving aircraft parts and four counts of wire fraud. He&#39;s now facing a sentence of up to 100 years in prison.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/boeing-chief-technical-pilot-737-max-fraud-charge-052259455.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">366fde33-757d-4953-87b0-62cb1bb4200c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 05:22:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634275388</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T05:23:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/49bdf3a0-201c-11ea-ba2b-57b11595aff2" width="8256" height="5504" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/49bdf3a0-201c-11ea-ba2b-57b11595aff2" width="8256" height="5504" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Robert Michaud via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Grounded Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft fleet of Southwest Airlines in storage at Victorville, CA. on May 4, 2019]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[737 MAX Southwest]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alienware celebrates its 25th birthday with a redesigned flagship gaming desktop]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/alienware">Alienware</a> began operations 25 years ago in a garage near Miami, and the Dell-owned brand is celebrating the milestone anniversary with a stylish gaming PC. The latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-aurora-desktop-intel-11th-gen-150009385.html">Aurora system</a> has a redesigned chassis that has extra internal space and more efficient airflow, and it should run more quietly.</p><p>The open-air Legend 2.0 chassis increases the internal volume by 50 percent compared with Aurora R12 or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-m15-m17-rtx-30-gpus-174537703.html">R10</a> without major changes to the overall size of the machine, Alienware says. You won&#39;t need any tools to open up the shell, so you&#39;ll have easier access to the components. There&#39;s an optional transparent side panel, so you can look inside and see a motherboard lit up with up to eight zones of AlienFX lighting. In addition, Alienware is also offering an optional magnetic cable cover to keep the back of the system in order.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/56f0be50-2ac3-11ec-89eb-86fd214c2a98" alt="Alienware Aurora with optional rear magnetic cover to keep cables tidy" data-uuid="4ee405a9-7111-3ce8-ace4-1e8d6598c77b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Alienware</div></figure><p>As part of the redesign, Alienware focused on improving the airflow. Every system has two 120mm fans, an intake and an exhaust. Depending on the configuration, Alienware may include one or two more fans: first, a second intake and then, if needed, a top exhaust. Since this is an Aurora system, there are of course liquid cooling options too.</p><p>Along with keeping your system cool while you&#39;re running games at max settings, Alienware says the fans can make the PC quieter. Compared with the previous generation system, the brand claims the new Aurora is up to 16 percent quieter when idle and up to nine percent less noisy during CPU-intensive tasks. While you&#39;re overclocking, the PC can make up to 15 percent less noise.

Amazon couldn&#39;t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-european-commission-antitrust-report-135254227.html">misuse seller data</a> to compete against those sellers, for example, while Apple wouldn&#39;t be allowed to unfairly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-apple-app-store-search-rank-changes.html">rank its apps above others</a> in the App Store.&nbsp;</p><p>The senators characterized AICO as a modernization of antitrust law. It tackles the &quot;exclusionary conduct&quot; you see in leading platforms, Klobuchar said. Penalties would be steep, including fines of up to 15 percent of a company&#39;s revenue during the period when it broke the law.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The necessary House equivalent to the bill recently cleared that wing&#39;s Judiciary Committee and is waiting for a vote. Both bills stand a better-than-usual chance of passing thanks to both bipartisan support and a Biden administration focused on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-smaller-acquisitions-tech-giants-091043343.html">improving competition in technology</a>. The Senators have kept Biden&#39;s camp &quot;informed&quot; about work on the bill, Klobuchar added.</p><p>Industry lobbying groups like the Chamber of Progress (which counts tech firms like Amazon and Google in its ranks) have unsurprisingly balked at the bill. They contend the measure wouldn&#39;t be effective, and might even hurt favorite products. Not that this opposition will necessarily carry much weight. Senators have characterized this period as Big Tech&#39;s &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html">big tobacco moment</a>&quot; — that is, it&#39;s finally being held accountable for harmful behavior. Politicians across the spectrum appear eager to keep tech companies in check, and AICO may be one of their best near-term opportunities to rein in those corporate giants.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senate-american-innovation-choice-online-act-213803248.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3f7f783-391e-4b87-8a5e-fab83b74c70a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 21:38:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634247013</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T21:30:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d83f6970-2d2f-11ec-979b-77c4db0019a7" width="4363" height="2909" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d83f6970-2d2f-11ec-979b-77c4db0019a7" width="4363" height="2909" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 14: Sen.

The findings come from a report a team of researchers from the<a href="https://csmapnyu.org/"><ins>Center for Social Media and Politics at New York University</ins></a> shared with<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/14/technology/distortions-youtube-policies.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. In the immediate aftermath of the US election on November 3rd, the researchers recorded a dramatic increase in the number of YouTube election fraud videos shared on Twitter. That month, those clips represented approximately one-third of all election-related videos shared on the platform.</p><p>After December 8th, the day YouTube said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-removes-videos-with-us-election-fraud-claims-154726251.html"><ins>remove videos</ins></a> that claimed widespread errors and fraud changed the outcome of the contest, there was a dramatic drop in misleading election claims on Twitter. In that time period, the ratio of election fraud videos shared on Twitter from YouTube dropped to below 20 percent. That ratio fell again following the US Capitol riot when YouTube said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-election-fraud-video-bans-175750369.html"><ins>hand out strikes</ins></a> to any channel spreading misinformation about the results of the election. By the time President Biden swore the Oath of Office on January 20th, only around five percent of all election fraud videos on Twitter were coming from YouTube.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The researchers saw that same trend play out on Facebook. Before YouTube’s December 8th policy decision, about 18 percent of all videos shared on the platform were related to election fraud theories. By Inauguration Day, that number fell to four percent. To compile their findings, the team at New York University collected a random sampling of 10 percent of all tweets each day and then isolated the ones that linked out to YouTube videos. They did the same on Facebook using the company’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-11-facebook-buys-crowdtangle-content-tracking.html"><ins>CrowdTangle</ins></a> tool.</p><p>If nothing else, the findings highlight the outsized role YouTube plays in how information is shared in our current moment. As the most ubiquitous video platform on the internet, the company has an enormous amount of power to shape political discourse. Its policies can do both great harm and good. “It’s a huge part of the information ecosystem,” Megan Brown, a researcher at the Center for Social Media and Politics told <em>The Times</em>. “When YouTube’s platform becomes healthier, others do as well.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/new-york-university-youtube-misinformation-report-212302307.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2be47c4b-3671-432d-9f21-0411d326eb6a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 21:23:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634246584</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T21:23:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/877972b0-017b-11ea-add6-088504b9b34b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/877972b0-017b-11ea-add6-088504b9b34b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anatoliy Sizov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tyumen, Russia - April 30,2019: YouTube App icon channel on iPhone XR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[YouTube App icon channel on iPhone XR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US Army delays Microsoft's $22 billion HoloLens deal]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>American soldiers won&#39;t be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-wins-10-year-contract-supplying-ar-tech-to-the-us-army-193910504.html">training with HoloLens headsets</a> for a while. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-army-pushes-back-date-microsoft-goggles-says-fully-committed-219-bln-deal-2021-10-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsofts-22-billion-augmented-reality-headset-deal-us-army-gets-delayed"><em>Windows Central</em></a> report the US Army has delayed the deployment of the HoloLens-based Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) by a year, to September 2022. <em>Janes</em><a href="https://www.janes.com/defence-news/c4isr-command-tech/latest/us-army-and-microsoft-working-to-mature-ivas-technology-delays-operational-testing-and-fielding">understood</a> the delay was prompted by the need to bump operational testing from July this year to May 2022 to &quot;further mature&quot; the mixed reality technology.</p><p>The Defense Department&#39;s Inspector General <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2021/Oct/13/2002872906/-1/-1/1/D2022-D000AU-0013.000.PDF">launched</a> an audit earlier in October to determine whether or not Microsoft&#39;s system would meet requirements. It&#39;s not clear if the audit is linked to the delay.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This didn&#39;t mean the military-oriented HoloLens was in trouble. The Army maintained it was &quot;fully committed&quot; to the nearly $22 billion IVAS contract, and had conducted tests as recently as September. The branch planned to &quot;regularly&quot; conduct tests through its fiscal 2022, which ends September of next year.</p><p>IVAS is meant to serve as both a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-06-us-army-shows-hololens-use.html">combat assistant and training tool</a>. Infantry will see squad positions and other vital data in the field, complete with night vision — they&#39;ll ideally have the kind of situational awareness previously reserved for video games. In training, the headsets can supply data to help instructors improve specific techniques.</p><p>The delay won&#39;t do much to allay criticism of the HoloLens deal from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-23-microsoft-workers-demand-end-to-hololens-contract-with-army.html">inside Microsoft</a>. Employees have long objected to Microsoft directly supporting the military and &#39;gamifying&#39; war, especially as workers didn&#39;t have input on the decision. Microsoft isn&#39;t likely to change its tune, though. The company sees IVAS a way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-25-microsoft-ceo-defends-hololens-army-contract.html">aid and protect the troops</a> rather than an offensive weapon — and losing the contract would clearly hurt both Microsoft&#39;s bottom line and momentum for HoloLens at large.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-army-delays-microsoft-hololens-deal-202233405.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6261edbb-a91a-4c29-bef7-b4c30f307f7d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 20:22:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634300546</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T12:22:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/292ed390-2d24-11ec-affb-925da7ecb655" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/292ed390-2d24-11ec-affb-925da7ecb655" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Courtney Bacon/US Army]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US Army soldier using Microsoft HoloLens headset prototype]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US Army soldier using Microsoft HoloLens headset prototype]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chrome OS adds more natural voices for 'Select-to-speak' accessibility feature]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dyslexia affects as much as <a href="https://dyslexia.yale.edu/dyslexia/dyslexia-faq/"><ins>20 percent of the population</ins></a> and is one of the most common learning disabilities.

Matches run for up to 20 minutes and will take place across all seven of <em>Battlefield 2042</em>&#39;s maps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="11774d2a7a8c4d25a8c985fbfbaa1c2b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nkMiPwL8G1w?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Survival is key here. You only have one life, but one of your three teammates can resurrect you if you&#39;re killed. Once your entire team is wiped out, it&#39;s game over. Still, if you&#39;re sneaky enough, you can win a match without firing a shot. Some satellites will already be on the ground at the start of a game, and more will drop in as the round progresses, so you&#39;ll need to adjust your strategy as you go.</p><p>Before the start of a round, you and your teammates can kit yourselves out with gadgets. Players can use money earned in previous matches (primarily by making it out with data drives) to buy gear like a scanner that shows data drive locations, a healing upgrade and a Squad Redeploy Call-in. The latter lets you revive dead squad mates; otherwise, you&#39;ll need to find a Redeploy Uplink somewhere on the map to bring back your buddies.</p><p>All of the XP you earn will go toward your overall Battlefield 2042 progression, which will boost your player level and unlock weapons. Teams are made up of unique characters — players will need to find specialists and loadouts that work in harmony to increase their chances of success.</p><p>Hazard Zone isn&#39;t quite a battle royale mode, since you don&#39;t need to be the last squad standing to win. Instead, it&#39;s objective-based and actually sounds a little like the main mode of Ubisoft&#39;s recently announced (and delayed) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-recon-frontline-battle-royale-180404978.html"><em><ins>Ghost Recon Frontline</ins></em></a>. As with the other <em>Battlefield 2042 </em>modes, Hazard Zone supports 64 players on Xbox One and PlayStation 4. On PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC, up to 128 players will square off on larger maps.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-hazard-zone-mode-details-191513433.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">195b4c0f-8779-4c3a-bb58-10075461af76</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 19:15:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634238698</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T19:11:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9ec3b740-2d21-11ec-bef7-08105d7dfb5a" width="1200" height="627" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9ec3b740-2d21-11ec-bef7-08105d7dfb5a" width="1200" height="627" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA DICE]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Battlefield 2042]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tinder thinks you should bring a stranger as a date to your next wedding]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tinder wants to help you find a date for the next wedding you plan to attend.

The journalist disclosed a Department of Elementary and Secondary Education web app flaw that let anyone see over 100,000 teachers&#39; Social Security numbers in site source code, and Parson interpreted this as a &quot;political game&quot; meant to &quot;embarrass the state&quot; — that is, a malicious hack.</p><p>The governor has already referred the case to the Cole County Prosecutor, and even has the Missouri Highway State Patrol investigating. An attorney for <em>The Post-Dispatch</em> maintained that the reporter &quot;did the responsible thing&quot; by sharing the flaw with the government to get it fixed. The lawyer also helpfully refreshed Parson on his internet lingo. A hacker is someone who &quot;subverts&quot; security with sinister intent, not a reporter trying to bolster security by sharing publicly available information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This flaw wasn&#39;t recent, either. University of Missouri-St. Louis professor Shaji Khan told <em>The Post-Dispatch</em> that this kind of vulnerability had been known for &quot;at least&quot; 10 years, and that it was &quot;mind boggling&quot; the Department would let these problems linger. Audits in 2015 and 2016 had highlighted data collection issues at both the Department and school districts.</p><p>No, prosecutors probably won&#39;t file charges. It&#39;s a bit difficult to convict someone whose &#39;hack&#39; effectively amounted to clicking &quot;view page source&quot; in their browser. However, this highlights an all-too-familiar problem with politicians that don&#39;t understand tech. It doesn&#39;t just lead to embarrassments, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-republicans-letter-to-2017-yahoo-ceo-211537563.html">letters to long-gone CEOs</a> — it can discourage responsible security disclosures and put thousands of people at risk.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/missouri-governor-says-security-181152203.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9e47711b-fc23-4eb8-9e5b-5d88cb4ed8c9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 18:11:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634235117</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T18:12:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/c9f60f10-d608-11ea-a7f9-39dc6ff5cc68" width="3332" height="2217" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/c9f60f10-d608-11ea-a7f9-39dc6ff5cc68" width="3332" height="2217" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jacob Moscovitch via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JEFFERSON CITY, MO - MAY 29: Gov.

Now, when you get to the bottom of a set of results, the company’s search engine will instead automatically load the next page for you, allowing you to continuously scroll until you find a website you want to visit.</p><p>You should see the change on both your mobile web browser and the Google app for iOS and Android.

The change follows a redesign of mobile search Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-mobile-search-redesign-213110432.html"><ins>released at the start of 2021</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While most usually find what they’re looking for quickly, Google notes some people view as many as four pages of search results before they click through to a website. The company suggests the move to continuous scrolling should be particularly helpful to those who tend to ask more open-ended questions of its search engine. It’s also a tweak that brings the platform more in line with modern feed-style apps like Instagram and TikTok.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-search-continuous-scrolling-171307808.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2bc164ca-74c6-44fc-93db-5dc8ac143ee8</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 17:13:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634231591</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T17:13:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Internet & Networking Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/11c76ea0-1a84-11eb-bfef-701ecbd78495" width="5300" height="3533" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/11c76ea0-1a84-11eb-bfef-701ecbd78495" width="5300" height="3533" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google closeup logo displayed on a phone screen, smartphone on a keyboard is seen in this multiple exposure illustration, the company's symbol is globally recognized.

One year after suffering a decisive defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad, a Nazi officer named Oberführer Wolfram Von List finds a mysterious artifact that binds him to an entity called Kortifex, allowing him to summon an army of the undead. It’s up to you and as many as three other players to battle through the ruins of Stalingrad and stop him.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you play through a match and complete objectives, you’ll find items called Sacrificial Hearts. You can offer these at an Altar of Covenants to access randomized upgrades that will tweak your playstyle. One of those upgrades will reload your weapons while they’re holstered, while another will allow you to turn zombies into temporary allies.</p><p>Any experience you earn while playing Zombies will count toward <em>Vanguard’s </em>Batte Pass, which also shares progression between multiplayer and <em>Warzone</em>. The mode will also support cross-platform play between different consoles. As mentioned above, <em>Vanguard</em> launches on November 5th. It will be available on PlayStation 4, PS5, PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-vanguard-zombies-trailer-170042898.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52a41ac8-7361-43d5-9663-b0f03736c6c2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 17:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634227935</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T16:12:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0b3f6340-2d06-11ec-bd5e-79d6311161c3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0b3f6340-2d06-11ec-bd5e-79d6311161c3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Activision]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Vanguard Zombies]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Vanguard Zombies]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nanoleaf Lines are customizable smart light bars]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nanoleaf-essentials-bulb-lightstrip-154053040.html">Nanoleaf</a> knows that its users sometimes crave something a bit more minimal than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nanoleaf-adds-triangles-to-its-colorful-shape-light-panels-103342521.html">LED light panels</a> that stretch across their wall.

Each “Line” is 10.96-inches (27.85cm) long, and can join to its siblings at either end, or at a 60-degree angle. The company says that you can “paint your space with lines,” creating “grand geometric shapes” and “sleek linear layouts.”</p><p>But beyond the new style of design, this is still the same Nanoleaf setup that you already know and love, letting you paint with light. Each Line has two color zones, and you can plug in dynamic lighting scenes, sync with your music and mirror the colors on your computer’s display. In addition, the hardware will act as a Thread Border Router to help connect smart gear nearby that can also harness the same protocol.
