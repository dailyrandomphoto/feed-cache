The M1 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-upscaled-133046858.html">a powerful chip</a> designed by Apple that can handle most day-to-day tasks with ease and speed. The chip boasts an eight-core CPU (with four performance and four efficiency cores) and an eight-core GPU.

On the connectivity front, there are two Thunderbolt ports and a pair of USB-A ports, along with HDMI 2.0, WiFi 6 and gigabit Ethernet support. There&#39;s a 3.5mm headphone jack too.</p><p>Unlike with an M1 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">MacBook</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">iMac</a>, you&#39;ll need to connect your own display, keyboard and mouse, which might not leave a lot of space among those ports for other peripherals. You won&#39;t be able to upgrade the storage or RAM either. However, the base Mac Mini should still be capable enough for many users.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m1-amazon-good-deal-143337984.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8d5b3630-d30c-4e77-a022-2f1b67e2883e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 14:33:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628604827</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T14:14:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/b90d6ba0-e088-11ea-bf7d-559c3cbc732c" width="1600" height="1069" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Oh hey, Xiaomi has its own creepy robot dog now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-second-largest-phone-brand-q2-2021-141814474.html">Xiaomi </a>has today announced the CyberDog, an open-source quadruped robot intended for developers to “build upon” and create applications for.

It may not be the most high-powered Chromebook out there, but it has essential features that most users need at a price well under $500. At launch, the Flex 5 came in at $430, but it often went on sale and could be found for $330 on rare occasions. But Amazon has it for even less right now — only $310 — which is $120 off and the best price we&#39;ve seen.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook at Amazon - $310" href="https://amzn.to/3xvrtNX">Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook at Amazon - $310</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When you get to the $300 mark in the Chromebook space, you&#39;re often asked to sacrifice when it comes to power. That&#39;s not the case with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review-170023587.html">Flex 5</a> — it runs on a 10th-gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Those specs should be more than enough for most people, especially considering a majority of Chromebook work will be done in a browser. We found the Flex 5 was more than capable of running numerous Chrome tabs at once with few hiccups. We also appreciated its ability to do so for at least eight hours before needing to be recharged.</p><p>When it comes to design, the Flex 5 doesn&#39;t take too many risks and that&#39;s ok. It&#39;s not the slimmest or the lightest laptop, but at 0.66-inches thick and three pounds, it won&#39;t be hard to shuffle from room to room in your home or tote with you to school. It&#39;s also a convertible, which gives you more flexibility in how you use it. The 13-inch 1080p touchscreen will serve most people well, be it for work or entertainment purposes, and we especially liked its backlight keyboard.</p><p>Overall, it&#39;s hard to find a Chromebook that ticks so many boxes at this price point. Sure, Lenovo made some sacrifices when it comes to RAM and storage capacity, but those are to be expected when you&#39;re looking at sub-$500 Chromebooks. The Flex 5 combines a solid 2-in-1 design with a good amount of power at a wallet-friendly price point, and that&#39;s more than we can say for other Chromebooks coming in at $300.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-deal-310-amazon-135551711.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c75c7733-dda9-47cd-a4f9-cd651db8fc28</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:55:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628605893</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T14:31:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81af6eb0-b70c-11ea-b58f-83ed1eddec2c" width="1600" height="928" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/81af6eb0-b70c-11ea-b58f-83ed1eddec2c" width="1600" height="928" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[laptop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xiaomi's Mi Mix 4 packs an under-screen camera in a ceramic body]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just days after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-next-gen-under-screen-camera-usc-030044965.html">Oppo</a> unveiled its latest under-screen camera solution, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-second-largest-phone-brand-q2-2021-141814474.html">Xiaomi</a> is now launching a new flagship phone with a similar, if not the same, feature. The Mi Mix 4 is the Chinese company&#39;s slimmest ceramic unibody smartphone yet, featuring a 6.67-inch 2,400 x 1,080 screen that stealthily hides a 20-megapixel selfie camera underneath a near-indistinguishable patch of pixels — it&#39;s the same 400ppi density as the rest of the panel, albeit with smaller pixels and transparent circuitry thanks to advancements in AMOLED production.</p><p>If the selfie photos on the Mi Mix 4 turn out to be just as good, if not better, than Oppo&#39;s samples from last week, then it&#39;s no surprise that Xiaomi went with this under-screen camera tech. The Mix series has always been about pushing the boundary of form factor design, with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-25-xiaomi-mi-mix.html">first</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-11-xiaomi-mi-mix-2-ceramic-unibody-price.html">two</a> models — both designed by Philippe Starck — offering super slim screen bezels along three sides. They were some of the first ceramic smartphones, too.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-25-xiaomi-mi-mix-3-slider-hands-on.html">Mi Mix 3</a>, Xiaomi finally got rid of the chin by moving the selfie camera to a slide-up module. I wasn&#39;t a fan of that design, though, as it felt more fragile.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a31d1130-f9da-11eb-befd-dbdcfab3877c" alt="Xiaomi Mi Mix 4" data-uuid="fc37a598-9bdd-3f22-9b98-954c312b6d7b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>Now that the under-screen camera is seemingly reaching maturity, it serves as a sensible evolution path to the Mi Mix 4. Still, CEO Lei Jun added that if you really care about your selfies, you should stick to phones with punch-hole cameras; but for him, the under-screen camera is good enough.</p><p>The screen itself is otherwise very much the same as what many other recent flagships are offering: 10-bit color, P3 gamut, Dolby Vision, HDR10+, 120Hz refresh rate and 480Hz touch sampling rate. It&#39;s protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass Victus. Like many recent Xiaomi phones, the Mi Mix 4 provides stereo sound tuned by Harman/Kardon, which should go well with that vibrant screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e8ef87c0-f9de-11eb-8dff-b48a3049e120" alt="Xiaomi Mi Mix 4 heat sink" data-uuid="1a7aad1c-17c6-3e77-9e59-9efb2d7a579c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Xiaomi</div></figure><p>The Mi Mix 4 also happens to be the first smartphone sporting Qualcomm&#39;s latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Snapdragon 888+</a> 5G processor, taking the clock speed up to 3GHz while being cooled by several layers of graphene and graphite. LPDDR5 RAM options range from 8GB to 12GB, whereas UFS 3.1 storage goes from 128GB to 512GB.</p><p>Much like the iPhone 12 series, the Mi Mix 4 also packs UWB (ultra-wide band), but instead of tracking tags, Xiaomi is using this for a feature dubbed &quot;Point to Connect.&quot; Simply point your Mi Mix 4 to a compatible Xiaomi smart device like a TV, smart speaker (like the freshly-announced Xiaomi Sound) or air conditioner, and the relevant app will show up.&nbsp;</p><p>The company will also offer a small UWB hub for existing TVs, and this will launch via a beta program in China on August 20th.

Now, thirty years and change since its heyday, Retro Games is making a “mini” version of the computer and games console. Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-29-commodore-64-mini-releases-in-2018.html">Retro Games’</a> last machine, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-06-c64-mini-review.html">“mini” version of the Commodore 64</a> that can’t use the Commodore name, this will be branded as THEA500 Mini.</p><p>Retro Games has said that the console will include 25 titles from the vast (and excellent) Amiga library including <em>Another World, Worms, Simon the Sorcerer</em> and <em>The Chaos Engine</em>. The full list of titles hasn’t been released, but if<em> Bart vs. The Space Mutants</em> and <em>Dalek Attack </em>aren’t on there, I will<em> cry</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8255fdc9c2c4481aa0dc4f8721a22fb7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yKUgEOpr4Qs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Much like pretty much every other retro console, a glossy software layer will smooth out the rougher edges of this software. Users will be able to save and resume titles part-way through play, and you’ll be able to side-load titles you (ahem) own over the included USB port.</p><p>Rather than simply emulating the vanilla Amiga 500, the hardware will also run the Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) layers found in the Amiga 500 Plus, a short-lived revision released in 1991. You’ll also be able to harness the advanced graphics architecture (AGA) of the much-pricier flagship model, the Amiga 1200.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a90f4f0-f9da-11eb-a5ff-8a575ca64846" style="height:1500;width:2000;" alt="Looks more like a CD controller to me." data-uuid="8678ab84-5e83-391d-bc35-b091c51d21c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Retro Games / Koch Media</div></figure><p>Hardware-wise, it’s likely to be a similar sort of moulded-plastic-around-a-mini-board situation as found in THEC64 Mini. But on the accessories front, it’ll ship with the Amiga’s famous two-button mouse, and a joypad that, to my eyes, seems to be based on the Amiga CD32’s gamepad rather than the 500’s (which, to be fair, was more famously a joystick-led machine).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b98770a0-f9da-11eb-afeb-0f39e83c0602" style="height:1600;width:2000;" alt="Image of Retro Games&#39; THEA500 Mouse" data-uuid="267551d5-b8f5-3fb8-9572-04db9063f33a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Retro Games / Koch Media</div></figure><p>THEA500 Mini will launch at some point in early 2022, and is expected to cost $140 (£120, €130) when it arrives. The only misgivings I have at this point is that Retro Games’ previous work with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-23-c64-mini-launches-in-us-october-9.html">THEC64 Mini</a> made that a hard product to love in several ways.

The latest updates will make YouTube videos created by kids private by default, allow minors or their parents to request the removal of their images from Google Image results, turn SafeSearch on by default and more. The move is part of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-parental-controls-tweens-teens-supervised-accounts-160050870.html">recent push</a> by Google to protect kids and give parents more control over what they see.</p><p>Many of the updates are dedicated to YouTube and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-youtube-kids-website.html">YouTube Kids</a>. The key change is aimed at young creators aged 13 to 17, changing the default upload setting to the most private option available. That means by default, the video can only be seen by select users unless the creator changes it to public. &quot;We want to help younger users... make an intentional choice if they’d like to make their content public,&quot; Google wrote.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google is also expanding its so-called digital well-being tools for YouTube. It&#39;ll turn on break and bedtime reminders by default for all kids aged 13 to 17 while turning off autoplay by default. At the same time, it&#39;s adding an autoplay option on YouTube Kids while, at the same time, turning it off by default in the app. Parents will also be able to choose a &quot;locked&quot; default autoplay setting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Knowing the accurate age of our users across multiple products and surfaces, while at the same time respecting their privacy and ensuring that our services remain accessible, is a complex challenge.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, Google said it will be removing &quot;overly commercial content&quot; from YouTube Kids, like a video that &quot;only focuses on product packaging or directly encourages children to spend money.&quot; It also updated the disclosures that appear on “made for kids” content when a creator identifies a video as containing paid promotions.</p><p>On Search, Google promised to give minors &quot;more control over their digital footprint.&quot; To that end, it&#39;s introducing a new policy allowing anyone under 18, or their parents or guardians, to request the removal of their images from Google Image search results. That change is designed to &quot;help give young people more control of their image online,&quot; Google wrote. It will also turn SafeSearch on for all existing users under 18 and make it the default for teens setting up new accounts. Currently, it&#39;s just turned on for teen accounts managed by Family Link.</p><p>In other apps, Google will disable location history for all users under 18 without the ability to turn it on. It&#39;s launching a safety section in Play that will show parents which apps follow Google&#39;s Families policies and disclose how they use the data they collect in greater detail. On the advertising side, it will &quot;block ad targeting based on the age, gender, or interests of people under 18,&quot; the company wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Google stressed that it wants to work with &quot;kids and teens, parents, governments, industry leaders, and experts in the fields of privacy, child safety, wellbeing and education to design better, safer products for kids and teens.&quot; Taken as a whole, the new changes should help prevent young people from seeing harmful content while blocking exploitive ads. In practice, however, it may take some time to shake out any bugs and ensure that advertisers are following the rules — so as always, it&#39;s best to keep a close eye on your kids&#39; digital habits.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-unveils-major-safety-changes-for-kids-on-search-you-tube-and-more-130051206.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5bf4dd96-ebf4-4e64-ab95-922fc031e23a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 13:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628582422</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T08:00:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/d7482380-cf3b-11e9-bf59-af0045c94c3d" width="4166" height="2628" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/d7482380-cf3b-11e9-bf59-af0045c94c3d" width="4166" height="2628" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chesnot via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PARIS, FRANCE - APRIL 10:  In this photo illustration, the logo of the Google and You Tube Kids applications are displayed on the screen of an Apple iPhone on April 10, 2018 in Paris, France.

It&#39;ll normally set you back $150, but Amazon is having a sale right now that knocks $20 off the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple TV HD" href="https://amzn.to/3CBAA3p">Apple TV HD</a>, bringing it down to $130.

It&#39;s still a little black box capable of streaming 1080p video from a variety of sources including Apple TV+, Netflix, Disney+ and others. It runs on Apple&#39;s A8 processor, comes with 32GB of onboard storage and the back edge houses a power port, one USB-C port, one HDMI connector and an Ethernet port. These specs make it a good basic set-top box, but it has some Apple-ecosystem features that set it apart. It supports AirPlay and HomeKit-enabled viewing of camera feeds, plus you&#39;ll be able to listen privately using AirPods.</p><p>The update earlier this year brought the latest Siri remote to the Apple TV HD. This is a big deal because the previous Siri remote just wasn&#39;t that great to use, and Apple finally fixed some of its major problems. The new remote is larger and has a revamped directional pad that makes controlling the set-top box much easier. The pad is also touch-sensitive, making scrolling through carousels of content much smoother. There&#39;s even a power button on the remote now that lets you turn on and off your TV.</p><p>While a slick new remote probably isn&#39;t enough to warrant buying a whole new streaming device, the new Siri remote certainly sweetens this deal on the Apple TV HD.

My favorite was <em>Gargoyles</em>. I have a special place in my heart for <em>TaleSpin</em>, but <em>DuckTales</em> was the undisputed king of the lineup. One hundred episodes and a movie with plenty of race cars, lasers, airplanes, robots, super suits, caveducks and, of course, Scrooge’s Lucky Number One Dime.</p><p>Plenty of cartoons from the ‘80s have seen reboots in the past decade, but few have failed to outshine the original or gain a real fandom. So when a <em>DuckTales</em> reboot was announced, I was admittedly a bit wary, though the cast announcement certainly was enough to get my jaded self at least a little excited, with David Tennant as Scrooge McDuck and Beck Bennett as Launchpad McQuack.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d075d6f106c449379cad76113ab9bf4d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZek9PFMYOw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The show debuted in July 2017 and I have to say they nailed it. It straddled the line between giving fans all the little in-jokes and callbacks to the original show they loved, but also introducing new characters (like tech mogul Mark Beaks) and plotlines to make the show feel fresh and modern. Huey, Dewey and Louie were given different color-coded outfit designs, distinct personalities and separate character arcs. Mrs. Beakley was upgraded from Scrooge’s housekeeper to also being a former secret agent he used to work with. And Webby was aged up and made more adventurous, so she could hold her own on any journey and even make a few friends along the way.</p><p>The show’s biggest strength was how heavily it drew from its source material, not just the original series but the original Carl Barks comics that inspired it in the first place. <em>DuckTales</em> (2017) marks the first animated appearance of Huey, Dewey and Louie’s mother (and Donald’s sister) Della. She was also modernized, made into an adventuring pilot with a short temper, not unlike her brother’s. The show also referenced other Disney Afternoon shows like <em>TaleSpin</em>, <em>Chip ’N’ Dale’s Rescue Rangers</em> and <em>Goof Troop</em>. It was truly a love letter to fans, but one with a solid plot and some wicked humor that today’s kids could still enjoy.</p><div id="1589be216df64eb3b3b8ddc37fda0fca"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XWCCzD7TTI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The show came to an end earlier this year, with the third season hitting <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/P0ab6Y">Disney+</a> back in March. While the first season dealt with Magica DeSpell and season two was all about the Moon, season three pit Clan McDuck against the evil agency F.O.W.L. The creators knew this would be the last season, so it also pulls double duty on tying up stray plotlines and checking off their bucket list. That included bringing back Darkwing Duck and setting up a possible spinoff show, telling us the story of how Scrooge met Donald and Della, and even giving us a pseudo-sequel to <em>TaleSpin</em>.</p><p>Family was also a constant theme in the last season, with the show delving into Della’s newfound parenthood as well as where Webby ultimately sits within the family. I didn’t quite cry during the finale, but I came close. One thing that kept me going in the end was the knowledge that the story would continue in some form, not just in comics but in a weekly podcast featuring all the original voice actors. Seven episodes of <a href="https://youtu.be/2cDUgXVUpks"><em>This Duckburg Life</em></a> are available (yes, it is a parody of Ira Glass), and a nice thing about the program is that it contains no spoilers for the cartoon so you can check it out even before you binge the show on Disney+. The episodes are fairly short, less than 15 minutes, which is fine because DuckTales has always been good at packing a lot of adventure into its 22-minute runtime.</p><div id="35a997b9f4d04be78621a0b8a4d2c527"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nOxxw8zu-sM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ducktales-2017-reboot-podcast-disney-plus-110100145.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4812f19-9fde-4f7d-b045-a71c65429268</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 11:01:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628542213</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T20:50:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8ceff200-f94f-11eb-9fb3-78de7ce2f8bf" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8ceff200-f94f-11eb-9fb3-78de7ce2f8bf" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DUCKTALES – “The Last Adventure!” – The future of adventuring hangs in the balance as the Duck family uncovers earth-shattering secrets in a final standoff with the Fiendish Organization for World Larceny (F.O.W.L.).

The search giant will now only offer two editions; one with USB-A and USB-C, both of which will pack NFC to enable it to be used by most mobile devices. That should reduce any confusion that would-be purchasers had with the current lineup, where some models packed the Near Field standard, and others did not. Google’s Christiaan Brand said that the company was going to focus on the “easier and more widely available NFC capability” going forward, although support and warranties for the existing Bluetooth keys would be “honored per their terms.” The new keys are now available on the Google Store.</p><p>Titan keys were initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-25-google-titan-security-key.html">launched in 2018</a> as Google’s take on the sort of hardware security key made by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yubicos-latest-security-key-uses-nfc-or-usbc-for-authentication-121635229.html">Yubikey</a> and others.

Starting September 1st, you&#39;ll be able to contact Amazon directly with a property damage or personal injury claim, and then Amazon will connect you with the seller.

And if you&#39;re the type of person who wants to show off, you can let the whole class see you. The company says it will also cap class sizes to ensure instructors can help every participant.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Outside of the camera feature, the app includes a &quot;FitFam&quot; social media component where you can add friends to see their schedules and stats, as well as invite them to classes you want to try. Pricing will depend on how much you plan to use the app. Monthly memberships <a href="https://www.barrys.com/barrys-x-faq/">start at $39</a>. The entry-level package includes access to four classes every 30 days. If you already pay for an in-studio membership, you can buy a $20 add-on that gives you access to the app&#39;s on-demand content. Another option is to pay for classes individually, though that will set you back $20 per session.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/barrys-x-fitness-app-054517166.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b65914f5-4f7c-44e7-bba6-da82aae22a32</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 05:45:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628569964</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T04:32:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/30a8d740-f955-11eb-bfda-3b13c0f79e1d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/30a8d740-f955-11eb-bfda-3b13c0f79e1d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barry's]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Barry's X]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Barry's X]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's new 5-nanometer chip is designed for smartwatches]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-the-industrys-first-5nm-processor-powering-the-next-generation-of-wearables">unveiled</a> the Exynos W920, a new processor designed specifically for smartphones and wearables.

The new slate of writers includes  Saladin Ahmed, Jonathan Hickman, Molly Ostertag, Scott Snyder and James Tynion IV, with other writers and artists to be announced at a later date.&nbsp;</p><p>As with other Substack writers, comics creators will send their work out in a newsletter format and charge subscribers directly for their work. During the first year, they&#39;ll be paid by Substack which will take most of the subscription revenue, and after that, the platform will take a 10 percent cut. Creators will retain ownership of all their materials.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tynion IV, who recently won the Eisner award for his work on DC&#39;s <em>Batman</em> and other titles, said he&#39;ll work on Substack exclusively. &quot;This wasn’t an easy decision,&quot; he told the <em>NY Times</em>. &quot;In order to invest my time in new material, I needed to choose. I could not do both.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>DC had presented me with a three-year renewal of my exclusive contract, with the intent of me working on Batman for the bulk of that time. I was grateful of the offer, but I couldn’t help but look at the success of my original, creator owned titles and wonder if it was the right choice.</p></blockquote><p>Substack first got into comics back in June when it signed Marvel&#39;s <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> writer Nick Spencer. Spencer reportedly spearheaded the idea and was the liaison between Substack and newly signed creators. On top of comic book stories, they&#39;ll publish, essays, how-to guides and other content on the platform.</p><p>Until recently, Substack has mostly focused on newsletters covering politics, technology and more. Comics, meanwhile, have been around forever on the web, but have largely been funded by ads and merchandise sales. By joining with Substack, creators will be able to engage directly with readers in a model that more closely resembles comic book sales.&nbsp;</p><p>In his Substack <a href="https://jamestynioniv.substack.com/p/a-whole-new-era">launch post</a>, Tynion said that he effectively turned down a three-year renewal of his DC Batman contract when Substack signed him &quot;to create a new slate of original comic book properties directly on their platform, that my co-creators and I would own completely,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I’m going to dedicate my whole brain to building a bunch of really cool stuff on my own terms, without having to get permission from any publisher to make it.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/substack-signs-a-slate-of-big-name-comics-creators-042310705.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8c2076b1-2951-485b-bed3-36bb179b84a8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 04:23:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628569389</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T04:23:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Visual Arts]]></category><category><![CDATA[Books & Publishing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Humanities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ef8e670-f98d-11eb-b7fd-6a26f1e6ec6a" width="1523" height="989" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ef8e670-f98d-11eb-b7fd-6a26f1e6ec6a" width="1523" height="989" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Michael Avon Oeming]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Substack signs a slate of big-name comics creators]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Substack signs a slate of big-name comics creators]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
