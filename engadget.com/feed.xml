But the company has a number of models under its belt, ranging from affordable to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-yh-l700a-anc-headphones-130036800.html">premium and pricey</a>. Following its <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/tw-e3a/index.html">TW-E3A</a> true wireless earbuds, Yamaha has announced <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/tw-e3b/index.html">the TW-E3B</a>: a set that it describes as its smallest and lightest option yet.&nbsp;</p><p>While that may be true, based on the product images, the TW-E3B still has considerable size compared to the truly tiny options like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">Jabra&#39;s Elite 3</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Buds 2</a>. Nevertheless, they&#39;re 25 percent smaller than the TW-E3A, which is an improvement. Besides the size, debossed logos and charging indicator lights on the case, the overall look of the new model is quite similar to that of it&#39;s predecessor. There are more color options available on the E3B, but overall, Yamaha didn&#39;t opt for a complete redesign here.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0ea73150-200b-11ec-bbfa-d2d2f7455ba7" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="Yamaha TW-E3B" data-uuid="d6dc6a62-9c3e-3925-9306-c0b5dae569b9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Yamaha</div></figure><p>Battery life is the same: six hours on the buds with three additional charges in the case for 24 hours total. The new version is still IPX5 rated for water and sweat resistance while on-board controls return to assist with audio playback, calls and activating your chose voice assistant. Yamaha brought back Listening Care, a feature that the company says will still give you &quot;full-range sound&quot; at lower volumes to help preserve your hearing. Like the TW-E3A, the TW-E3B works with Yamaha&#39;s app for Android and iOS that gives you a degree of customization for certain settings.&nbsp;</p><p>The TW-E3B will be available in late October for $99.95 — $30 less than the TW-E3A&#39;s debut price. When it arrives, you&#39;ll be able to choose from black, grey, green, blue, pink and purple color options. The TW-E3A is still available at a discount, <a href="https://usa.yamaha.com/products/audio_visual/headphones/tw-e3a/index.html">going for $49.95</a>. That&#39;s less than half of the original asking price of $129.95.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-tw-e3b-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-130041196.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c61fd4f-2d6d-4b05-b027-6055458798d3</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 13:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632800515</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T03:42:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/278eecd0-200b-11ec-b5f7-dfe48ee88784" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/278eecd0-200b-11ec-b5f7-dfe48ee88784" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yamaha]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Yamaha TW-E3B]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Yamaha TW-E3B]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[IKEA launches customizable Sonos speaker lamp with swappable shades]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>IKEA and Sonos will release a new, more customizable version of their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-ikea-symfonisk-review.html">Symfonisk</a> speaker lamp on October 12th. The furniture giant will sell the new model&#39;s lamp base and shade separately, allowing you to mix and match parts to ensure the final product fits the vibe of your home. You can choose between a black or a white lamp base, which the companies had designed to be slightly smaller than its predecessor. Stjepan Begic, product owner at IKEA of Sweden, said they decided to make make the base smaller after finding out that a lot of people use the Symfonisk lamp on their nightstand.&nbsp;</p><p>You can also choose between two types of shades: textile or glass. Both are available in black and white, as well. In addition, this model supports a wider range of bulbs thanks to its added E26/E27 socket, whereas the previous generation only fits E12 (E14 in the UK) bulbs. When it comes to the speaker itself, Sara Morris, Principal Product Manager at Sonos, said it provides a &quot;wider and more room-filling sound.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The companies launched the first Symfonisk products back in 2019, giving you the chance to purchase  Sonos-level quality speakers without the Sonos-level price. These new lamps are priced similarly to the previously generation, which originally sold for $179. The base, which houses the WiFi-connected speaker itself, will set you back $152, confirming previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-sonos-speaker-lamp-swappable-shade-symfonisk-picture-frame-194040016.html">reports</a> about the then-unannounced product. A textile cover will cost you $24, while a glass one will set you back $35. In all, you&#39;ll be paying $169 for a lamp with a textile shade and $179 for one with glass.</p><p>The new Symfonisk lamp will be available in IKEA&#39;s brick-and-mortar stores and online in the US and select European markets when it launches in October. It will eventually make its way to all of IKEA&#39;s markets next year.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b5bca3b0-203f-11ec-bdda-8493f2a4ceed" style="height:1062;width:1600;" alt="IKEA SYMFONISK" data-uuid="30517883-93b3-3fe5-8cac-5df29831ce57"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ikea</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ikea-customizable-sonos-symfonisk-130025280.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8636336-f8d4-403f-aa94-9b7fb09edbb3</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 13:00:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632822500</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T09:48:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/754d07d0-2039-11ec-b7e7-6c6d89b43e97" width="1600" height="1045" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/754d07d0-2039-11ec-b7e7-6c6d89b43e97" width="1600" height="1045" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ikea]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ikea]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ikea]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's 2019 Fire HD 10 tablet drops to a new low of $96]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-new-fire-hd-10-tablets-plus-kids-pro-130029307.html">new Fire HD 10 tablets</a> at the end of last month and now it seems the company is trying to get rid of previous models in a one-day closeout sale. The main device is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:64GB, 2019 Fire HD 10" href="https://amzn.to/2WoMLQQ">64GB, 2019 Fire HD 10</a>, which is nearly half off at $96. That&#39;s even better than its Prime Day price of $100 that we saw back in June, and considering the 2021 version of the tablet isn&#39;t too different, this is a good way to get one of the most capable Fire tablets for less.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2WoMLQQ" id="7e3062dc414b4cdbac8d4b674161e91e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 2019 Fire HD 10 (64GB) at Amazon - $96</a><p>The 2019 model and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:latest Fire HD 10" href="https://amzn.to/2XOLD9n">latest Fire HD 10</a> have a lot in common: both have 10.1-inch 1080p touchscreens, although the new version&#39;s is 10 percent brighter, and both run on 2.0GHz octa-core processors. The max amount of built-in storage you can get on either is 64GB, but both can be expanded with a microSD card slot. The 2019 version can hold up to 512GB of storage while the new model has a 1TB capacity. Both also have a 12-hour estimated battery life and both charge via USB-C.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Arguably the biggest differences between the two are in design and RAM. The 2021 model has a slightly more refined design with thinner bezels, and it comes in new colors as well as configurations like the &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Productivity bundle" href="https://amzn.to/3kNalAb">Productivity bundle</a>,&quot; which includes one year of Microsoft 365 and a keyboard case. Also, the previous version had 2GB of RAM while the new model has 3GB.&nbsp;</p><p>The increased RAM will likely make the biggest difference in the overall experience of the new Fire HD 10 compared to its predecessor. But if you&#39;re willing to skip that extra gigabyte of memory and the other small upgrades, the 2019 Fire HD 10 remains a solid budget tablet.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-2019-fire-hd-10-tablet-daily-deal-closeout-sale-125310342.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">08c4a820-c70f-4b95-b267-efeec8c1d11d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 12:53:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632833593</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T12:53:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/928c5e30-0a56-11eb-8458-6931e194f994" width="1600" height="1127" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/928c5e30-0a56-11eb-8458-6931e194f994" width="1600" height="1127" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon&#39;s 2019 Fire HD 10 tablet drops to a new low of $96]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox Series X/S consoles now support Dolby Vision for gaming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been quite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-dolby-atmos-vision-120027655.html"><ins>a long time coming</ins></a>, but Xbox Series X/S consoles now support Dolby Vision for gaming.

The company is well-known for its collection of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-skullcandy-indy-true-wireless-earbuds-announced.html">true wireless</a> and noise-cancelling gear that offers solid performance for much less than a lot of the competition. Today, Skullcandy is announcing two more sets of true wireless earbuds — the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Grind Fuel" href="https://fave.co/3zQlEvz">Grind Fuel</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Push Active" href="https://amzn.to/3CTJb0x">Push Active</a> — both of which offer a compelling set of features starting at $80. The company is also debuting its own voice platform, Skull-IQ, that allows you to do much of what your phone&#39;s voice assistant can handle, but with more of an audio focus. Get ready to say &quot;Hey Skullcandy&quot; a lot.&nbsp;</p><p>With Skull-IQ, Skullcandy has built a voice platform specifically catered to controlling music and its earbuds — and presumably its future headphones. In addition to a new command, you&#39;ll have the ability to play/pause, skip tracks, adjust volume, answer/reject calls, activate Stay Aware mode (ambient sound) and summon your device&#39;s built-in assistant. The company says it has also cooked up something novel. Skullcandy explains that it&#39;s the first to offer access to Spotify via voice command. Plenty of other companies give you one-tap ability to launch the service (these do that as well), but Skullcandy says it&#39;s the first to allow you to do it by speaking. Lastly, the company promises more features are coming in the future via over-the-air updates through the Skullcandy app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2f31b1f0-1ff4-11ec-b3ba-35f32af269a5" alt="Skullcandy Push Active" data-uuid="e5564356-fe4c-3183-90ae-23e3ce5083e5"><figcaption>Skullcandy Push Active</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skullcandy</div></figure><p>In terms of the new earbuds, some specs are the same for both models. Obviously, there are design differences as the Grind Fuel is a more &quot;traditional&quot; true wireless earbud while the Push Active is an over-the-ear hook option for a more secure fit. However, both feature the new Skull-IQ voice setup as well as &quot;supreme sound,&quot; that Stay Aware mode and what Skullcandy describes as noise-reducing mics for calls. The two new models are both IP55 rated sweat and water resistant with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/skullcandy-packs-tiles-location-tech-into-its-latest-wireless-earbuds-135549248.html">Tile tracking tech</a> built-in. They are also both equipped with on-board controls and a quick-charge feature that will give you two hours of listening time after 10 minutes in the case.&nbsp;</p><p>The Grind Fuel offers a few things the Push Active doesn&#39;t. Wireless charging and personalized sound via an in-app audio test are the two main ones. The Grind Fuel also has 9 hours of battery life on the buds with another 31 hours in the case. The Push Active will last 10 hours on a charge, while the case packs 34 more hours. Battery life isn&#39;t quite the same for both, but it&#39;s pretty close.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Push Active" href="https://amzn.to/3CTJb0x">Push Active</a> will cost $79.99 while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Grind Fuel" href="https://fave.co/3zQlEvz">Grind Fuel</a> is $99.99. Both are available now from the Skullcandy website and other retailers.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/skullcandy-skull-iq-voice-platform-true-wireless-earbuds-120021910.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a181e758-aee7-4163-a147-d78ee523e155</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 12:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632831150</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T12:12:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f6c89220-1fee-11ec-b9fe-816b6e6e4628" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f6c89220-1fee-11ec-b9fe-816b6e6e4628" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Skullcandy]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Skullcandy Grind Fuel]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Skullcandy Grind Fuel]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung recruits Vanilla Ice to fight climate change]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-copy-and-paste-brain-neuromorphic-chips-185359994.html">Samsung</a> wants you to increase your freezer&#39;s temperature to lower our collective carbon footprint, and it has enlisted Vanilla Ice&#39;s help to convince you. The rapper has re-released his 1990 hit song <em>Ice Ice Baby</em> as <em>Reduce Your Ice, Ice Baby</em>, both to call on everyone to adjust their freezer&#39;s temp and to promote its new Bespoke Refrigerator range. &quot;Turn down the freeze, and I&#39;ll glow. Jus&#39; one degree, I raise the temp like a vandal, climate friendly, wax a chump like a candle,&quot; Vanilla Ice raps in the song.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on a study the tech giant conducted using European Commission data, if every household in Europe alone increases its freezer&#39;s temperature by one degree Celsius, it could lower humanity&#39;s carbon emissions by over a million tons annually.

Being one of the the most popular music production suites, getting up and running natively on Apple silicon is pretty important for Ableton. The company <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/release-notes/live-11-beta/">notes</a> that, if you&#39;re already on the beta track, the autoupdater will not automatically download the M1 version — you&#39;ll need to grab the installer from Centercode.</p><p>There are a few other small improvements to Live as well. The most obvious will be the new Shifter device which is a real-time pitch shifting effect. It&#39;s monophonic, but has features like an LFO, glide, envelope and delay for further manipulating your sound.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are also two new Max for Live tools: Align Delay and MIDI Shaper.

So, an app that lets you play a synthesizer simply by humming a melody was clearly going to grab my attention.</p><p>Dubler first debuted last year as a packaged deal: a custom designed USB microphone and an app that turned your beatboxing, singing or any other audio really into MIDI data. With the launch of <a href="https://vochlea.com/products/dubler2"><ins>Dubler 2</ins></a>, Vochlea is making the special mic optional. The new app allows you to quickly and easily calibrate it to work with any microphone or audio source of your choice. But I want to be frank about something right off the bat: Dubler works best with its own special microphone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5a030940-2000-11ec-9ffc-f6fa10fa4a59" style="height:1126;width:2000;" alt="Microphones" data-uuid="16f78177-c6fa-3158-9f18-d0478aebb6a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>When I tested Dubler using both an SM57 and an SM58 run through a Focusrite 2i4 the results were decidedly mixed. The MIDI data was always a little messier, there was more noticeable latency and the pitch tracking just wasn’t as good. The latency was mostly an issue when using Dubler to trigger drums. With the buffer size in my audio settings at 128 samples it was almost impossible to keep a rhythm as the drum hits came just a little too slow and kept throwing me off.</p><p>If you use the dedicated mic sold by Vochlea, though, the story is a bit different. In fact, Dubler 2 is quite impressive. There is basically no noticeable latency. Pitch tracking is surprisingly accurate. And the resulting MIDI data is reasonably clean… or at least as clean as the source. Which I suppose is one of the first things I should lay out: If you can’t carry a tune, Dubler is only going to be so useful. My vocal skills are borderline nonexistent under the best of circumstances. But the onset of fall allergy season has made things <em>significantly </em>worse. (I would describe my current vocal style as chain-smoking donkey.) Could I get Dubler to spit out something resembling a melody? Sure. But it wasn’t always easy and I had to clean up a lot of MIDI after the fact.</p><p>So, I did what any smart person would do: Enlist the help of their sister who has spent a good chunk of her life singing and training with vocal coaches.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c3753510-2000-11ec-b97d-fdcea689eb34" style="height:1344;width:2000;" alt="Dubler 2" data-uuid="10c516aa-dabe-3f3e-a20a-04ec29c09b39"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vochlea</div></figure><p>The difference was immediately obvious. Where Dubler often struggled to figure out what was going on with my flat unsteady humming it was generally able to follow my sister’s vocal histrionics without much issue. You can tell Dubler to automatically snap notes to a particular scale which I highly recommend regardless of your skill level. But even in chromatic mode the app was able to pretty accurately identify notes my sister sang and even follow along the vibrato of her voice fairly well.</p><p>To get truly usable results out of Dubler though, you’ll need to learn to use it properly. While it’s fun to belt out a melody or clumsily beatbox your way through a drum part there are a lot of tricks to making the most of the app. For one, you’ll need to tailor your vocal sounds so that the app can recognize them easier. This is especially true of the drum triggers. Simple beatboxing is probably going to trip up the software unless you’re really good. Sounds like “ti” “ts” and “ta” will often get mixed up, so it’s better to use more distinct sounds that you might not reach for if you were actually trying to beatbox, like “ka”. It’s also best if you keep the number of triggers you use to three or four. You can program up to eight, but it’s hard to make varied enough sounds for it to be useful.</p><p>The same is true for melodies too. If you just hum with your lips closed, Dubler will struggle more to tell when you’ve changed notes and you’ll end up with messier data. It’s better to go with percussive sounds like “da” to help separate notes from each other.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d960a080-2000-11ec-afbf-7b4bb02daee6" style="height:1344;width:2000;" alt="Dubler 2" data-uuid="8066bc2e-c70b-38d5-9c9c-ba8a6e56fba1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vochlea</div></figure><p>You can also put Dubler in chord mode which I actually found was a fun and interesting way to come up with new progressions when I was feeling stuck. But perhaps my favorite feature is the ability to turn vowel sounds into MIDI CC information. That means that if you held a note and slowly shifted it from an “ooo” to an “aaa” you could cause the filter to open up. It’s difficult to control these features though, and it was better for creating strange and interesting noises than actual music.</p><p>If you’re vocally inclined then Dubler holds a lot of promise as a musical sketch pad. I sometimes struggle to turn what I hear in my head into melodies on a keyboard or guitar and humming it might be the quickest and easiest way to get an idea out.</p><p>While the ability to use the app with your own mic is appealing, right now the calibration seems like it could use a little work. That being said, my microphones are old and have seen a lot of abuse. And it’s not like the SM57 is known for its perfect vocal fidelity. I’d probably have better luck if I had SM7B fresh out of the box to test with. But I had to make due with what I had. And, what I had, wasn’t as good as Vochlea’s Dubler Studio mic when it came to capturing clean MIDI data. The software is pre-tuned for that mic and there’s fewer variables to contend with.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/82735c90-2000-11ec-a7f7-0b9493bc251d" style="height:1126;width:2000;" alt="Dubler Studio mic" data-uuid="55e66fac-5178-3ad5-b7ad-c2250280c9a9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Which leads us to our final point: price. Dubler is not cheap. And that’s not surprising. While Vochlea isn’t the first or only company to try turning audio into MIDI, it’s still not a simple task. So you’d have to be pretty committed to the idea of singing to control your synths to drop <a href="https://vochlea.com/products/dubler2"><ins>$329</ins></a> on the Dubler Studio Kit or even the $249 for the app on its own ($78 to upgrade if you own the original Dubler already). For someone like myself, it’s a tough sell. But for a vocalist who wants to start dabbling in the world of music production and synthesizers (even just for idea generation) without having to learn a whole new instrument I can certainly see the appeal.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dubler-2-can-turn-any-microphone-into-a-midi-controller-090002585.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c8f537ce-ae87-49f8-abc1-a8c6b1f316c7</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 09:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632795460</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T02:17:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c3753510-2000-11ec-b97d-fdcea689eb34" width="2000" height="1344" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d9607640-1ffc-11ec-b2ff-7f18ca371ef5" width="2000" height="1344" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vochlea]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dubler 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dubler 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Super Nintendo World Japan confirms Donkey Kong expansion for 2024]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210928.html">confirmed</a> that it will expand its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/super-nintendo-world-tour-044932014.html">Super Nintendo World</a> theme park at Universal Studios Japan with a new Donkey Kong section.

This new segment would bring its total length to over 45,000 km or 28,000 miles.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As its name implies, the 2Africa initiative&#39;s goal is to provide internet connectivity to people living in Africa, which is currently the least connected continent. This extension adds landing sites in India (Mumbai), Pakistan (Karachi), Oman (Salalah and Barakah), UAE (Kalba and Abu Dhabi), Qatar (Doha), Bahrain (Manamah), Iraq (AlFaw), Kuwait (Kuwait) and in Saudi Arabia (Khobar).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/924b1ea0-2028-11ec-bd6a-ef3f4228caaa" style="height:900;width:1600;" alt="2Africa" data-uuid="2771bdb7-847b-3b92-8939-06281bf3b9c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">2Africa</div></figure><p>In Facebook&#39;s announcement, Kevin Salvadori, the company&#39;s VP of networking infrastructure, said the full structure would serve more people than the consortium first intended. While the original 2Africa project was only meant to provide connectivity to 1.2 billion people, the addition of Pearls would allow the cable to serve a total of 3 billion people. He wrote:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The past 18 months have highlighted the importance of connectivity as billions of people around the world rely on the internet to work, attend school, and stay connected to people they care about. We continue to invest in subsea cables in Africa and beyond, as communities and businesses flourish when there is widely accessible internet.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-2-africa-longest-subsea-cable-in-the-world-070058568.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">56369d48-82b4-472c-8722-8e0327cb035f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 07:00:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632812117</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T06:55:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb911c70-2024-11ec-bb63-97c6c5bf26de" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb911c70-2024-11ec-bb63-97c6c5bf26de" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[2Africa]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[2Africa]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[2Africa]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Meet is testing live translated captions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-webcam-brightness-web-155518924.html">Google Meet&#39;s</a> latest beta feature could help make video conferences with foreign clients, partners, students and employees go more smoothly.

One potential savior was Microsoft, which had negotiated to acquire the app in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-not-buying-tiktok-233257859.html">lost its bid to Oracle</a>. At the <a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021">Code conference</a>, CEO Satya Nadella offered new details on the negotiation, telling journalist Kara Swisher it was &quot;the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever worked on,&quot; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-calls-failed-tiktok-talks-strangest-thing-ive-ever-worked/"><em>Geekwire</em></a> has reported.</p><p>It was a chaotic series of events that started when Trump threatened to force Chinese company ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US owner, citing privacy and security concerns. Microsoft stepped in as a potential buyer, though the company in the end struck a deal with Oracle and Walmart that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-oracle-walmart-sale-shelved-142133736.html">scrapped</a> by President Joe Biden&#39;s administration in February 2021.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>TikTok originally came to Microsoft, Nadella emphasized, seeking a cloud and security partner to help it pilot the delicate political landscape between China and the US. &quot;That&#39;s kind of how it started,&quot; he said. &quot;But I was pretty intrigued. I must say, it&#39;s a great property. Obviously, everyone has seen that growth and what have you, and I guess the rest is history.&quot;</p><p>In fact, just yesterday, TikTok reached <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-tiktok-1-billion-monthly-active-users-154034999.html">a billion users</a> and did so in less than four years. For perspective, it took Instagram almost eight years after its initial release and nearly six years after it was acquired by Facebook in 2012 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-20-instagram-1-billion-users.html">pass the 1 billion user threshold</a>.</p><blockquote><p>President Trump, I think had sort of a particular point of view on what he was trying to get done there, and then just dropped off,” he said. “I mean, it was interesting. There was a period of time when I felt that the [administration] had some particular set of requirements, and then they just disappeared.</p></blockquote><p>Swisher persisted with the subject, asking Nadella about Microsoft&#39;s negotiations with Trump. “President Trump, I think had sort of a particular point of view on what he was trying to get done there, and then just dropped off,” he said. “I mean, it was interesting. There was a period of time when I felt that the [administration] had some particular set of requirements, and then they just disappeared.”</p><p>In fact, Microsoft was in the middle of negotiations with ByteDance when Trump dropped a bomb, telling reporters that he&#39;d rather ban the app than allow it to be sold to a US company, according to a book by Microsoft President Brad Smith. That &quot;threw into disarray the careful negotiations we had pursued with ByteDance” to buy TikTok’s business in the U.S. and the three other countries, he wrote. Trump only relented and allowed a deal to happen after Nadella called him personally.</p><p>After Oracle&#39;s winning bid, ByteDance said that Trump had &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-trump-oracle-walmart-155348189.html">ghosted</a>&quot; the site, effectively going silent after ordering the company to divest its US TikTok assets.</p><p>Though it came away empty-handed, Microsoft did learn a few things about complex foreign negotiations around tech. &quot;It’s possible to run a foreign technology service in a domestic data center with strict security, privacy, and digital safety controls in a manner that provides appropriate transparency to local government officials,&quot; said Smith.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-calls-tik-tok-deal-strangest-thing-ive-ever-worked-on-052616118.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">631c6caa-a498-457f-b151-41c8f7b2506c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 05:26:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632806768</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T05:26:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0f19e090-201c-11ec-bcb4-b30e56a2829e" width="2310" height="1686" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0f19e090-201c-11ec-bcb4-b30e56a2829e" width="2310" height="1686" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anushree Fadnavis / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft, gestures as he attends Microsoft's 'Young Innovators' Summit' in New Delhi, India February 26, 2020.

Facebook’s head of safety is scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/9/protecting-kids-online-facebook-instagram-and-mental-health-harms">hearing</a> on the subject Thursday.</p><p>Now, Facebook seems to be hoping that releasing more of its underlying research could help address concerns from lawmakers and others. In a separate statement <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/">published</a> Sunday, the company’s top researcher suggested that <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> had mischaracterized its research. Clegg went a step further Monday, saying that the reporting based on documents “leaked by someone who clearly feels they have some points to make.”</p><p>“If you read the decks, and then compare it with some of the assertions that, you know, Instagram is toxic for all teens and so on, I don&#39;t think any reasonable person … would say that the research sustains that claim,” Clegg said. “When the dust settles people will see that we&#39;re just sincerely trying to kind of — like external researchers — are trying to work out what the complex relationship is between individuals, given their own individual circumstances, and their lives and their use of social media.”</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the company would release “two decks” that were central to <em>The Journal</em> report, but didn’t elaborate on the timing of the release.</p><p>But the decks alone are unlikely to quiet Facebook’s critics. For one, Facebook’s own rebuttal of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reporting appears <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">to undermine</a> the significance of its own research. “This research, some of which relied on input from only 40 teens, was designed to inform internal conversations about teens’ most negative perceptions of Instagram,” Facebook VP Pratiti Raychoudhury wrote. “It did not measure causal relationships between Instagram and real-world issues.”</p><p>It also raises questions about how Facebook will present the data it does make public. Last month, the company released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html">a report</a> on “widely viewed content” on its platform. The report was meant to rebuff criticism that News Feed favors polarizing content. But researchers outside the company quickly poked holes in the report, and said it was emblematic of Facebook’s larger transparency issues, particularly when it comes to working with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-data-transparency-researchers-170021370.html">outside researchers</a>.</p><p>Which is why it’s notable that Clegg would invoke “external researchers” in his defense of the company. If Instagram isn’t actually harmful to most teens, as the company is claiming, then researchers not on Facebook’s payroll may be positioned to credibly make that point. Yet researchers say the company has made data increasingly difficult to access. And in some cases, the company has actively blocked outsiders from studying its platform, like when it recently disabled the personal Facebook accounts of researchers at New York University and then provided <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-letter-facebook-nyu-ad-observatory-014113346.html">“misleading”</a> explanations about its reasons for doing so, according to the FTC. (Incidentally, the researcher at the center of that controversy is testifying in a separate Congressional<a href="https://republicans-science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/investigations-oversight-subcommittee-hearing-disinformation-black-box"> hearing</a> this week.)</p><p>They may seem like unrelated issues. But if Facebook had better relationships with researchers outside the company, and made more of its own findings public it might be better able to head off internal critics who “have some points to make.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-safety-research-212546087.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7fac7da-2314-48c0-a67a-2db264a54e1c</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 21:25:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632784654</ingested><modified>2021-09-27T23:17:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-07/5f6af1a0-a99b-11e9-bcad-c7fa8d54ceaf" width="4090" height="2727" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/5f6af1a0-a99b-11e9-bcad-c7fa8d54ceaf" width="4090" height="2727" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Platiau / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A visitor takes a picture of the Instagram application logo at the Young Entrepreneurs fair in Paris, France, February 7, 2018.

According to <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/babylon-5-reboot-the-cw-j-michael-straczynski-1235075236/"><em>Variety</em></a>, The CW has ordered a reboot of the seminal sci-fi series. What’s more, original creator J. Michael Straczynski is attached to the project.</p><p>That’s good news because Straczynski penned 92 of the 110 episodes that make up <em>Babylon 5</em>. At the moment, there are relatively few details on the production, but what we do know is that it’s being billed as a “from-the-ground-up reboot.” None of the original actors from the series, including Bruce Boxleitner, are currently attached to the project, but that may change. With its sometimes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/babylon-5-original-4-3-ratio-video-150022687.html">dated visuals</a>, it can be hard to see what makes <em>Babylon 5 </em>so special.

For one thing, video calls (on what Skype calls the &quot;call stage&quot;) are getting a visual overhaul. New layouts and themes are on the way. You&#39;ll be able to see yourself on the main view while you&#39;re on a call, though you can hide your feed if you&#39;d rather not look at your own face.</p><p>Video feeds are being rearranged into a grid to avoid relegating folks to a minimized view. Instead everyone on the call, including those who aren&#39;t sharing video, will be visible.

You can also opt only to include people who are sharing video in the grid or switch the video stream off completely. Audio-only participants can use one of the app&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/skype-custom-background-images-193644673.html"><ins>background replacement images</ins></a> while on a call, rather than grey nothingness.</p><p>More colorful themes are in the pipeline, with features including gradients for buttons and for users without avatars. Meanwhile, &quot;the beauty of the left side panel screams art, balance and lightness,&quot; says Skype, giving perhaps its best Apple impression.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1e5a8570-1fc5-11ec-beff-297b5e4c87b1" style="height:3087;width:3550;" alt="Redesigned Skype Meet Now invite, with a name and avatar for the call" data-uuid="96cbe954-01b8-332d-a6ac-911f3e15a217"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skype</div></figure><p>Skype is also redesigning <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-03-skype-meet-now-zoom.html"><ins>Meet Now</ins></a>, which allows people to join calls without signing up or installing the app. Invitation links are getting a new look, as invitees will see the name and avatar of your call. The service says it will soon support all browsers as well.</p><p>In addition, Skype is working on performance. It claims it has boosted performance &quot;in key scenarios&quot; by almost a third on the desktop app and by over 2,000 percent on Android. Also new or on the way are custom notification sounds, and an updated reactions window that lets you respond more quickly by searching or using pinned reactions.</p><p>Elsewhere, you can use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-16-office-lens-on-windows-10-support-office365.html">Office Lens</a> on the Skype mobile app to share scanned documents, photos and videos. A new feature called TwinCam will let you add a video feed from a second device to your call. That could be handy if you want to show off your pet, or let students see your textbook and your face at the same time. Just scan a QR code with your iOS or Android device to get started.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8aecab60-1fc4-11ec-a4fd-06187d52d3e8" style="height:700;width:1453;" alt="Skype TwinCam feature" data-uuid="4f701542-20af-3a43-97e5-517269214cb7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skype</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/skype-colorful-redesign-features-twincam-191644761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4423367b-d07c-4126-b4bb-d1959829c5f8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:16:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632770207</ingested><modified>2021-09-27T19:16:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ab343820-1fc4-11ec-a6fd-b94b59815f3f" width="3190" height="1890" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ab343820-1fc4-11ec-a6fd-b94b59815f3f" width="3190" height="1890" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Skype]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Skype redesign on a MacBook Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Skype redesign on a MacBook Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Democratic lawmakers say Facebook 'must completely abandon' Instagram Kids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mere hours after Facebook said it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pausing-work-on-instagram-kids-app-124639135.html"><ins>pausing work on Instagram Kids</ins></a>, a group of Democratic lawmakers has called on the company to instead completely abandon the project.
