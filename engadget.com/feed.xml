It might use the buds as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eargos-latest-smart-hearing-aids-bring-a-much-needed-hearing-test-160001810.html">hearing aids</a>, but it could also use the motion sensors to correct your posture. A prototype would even include a thermometer to check your core body temperature, according to leaked documents.</p><p>The features wouldn&#39;t show up in 2022 and might not be available at all, the sources said. Apple declined to comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple would face numerous hurdles to marketing AirPods as health gadgets. The company would likely require regulatory clearance for at least some features. A US Food and Drug Administration ruleset due in 2022 might make that possible, but it could still take months to approve the earbuds. Even Bose had to wait a long time before it could sell its FDA-cleared <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aids-152746656.html">SoundControl hearing aids</a>.</p><p>There are technical challenges, too. Right now, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a> won&#39;t last longer than 4.5 hours for listening (with noise cancelling on), and 3.5 hours for calls — that just wouldn&#39;t be practical for health wearables that might need to sit in your ears all day. They&#39;d also need to be comfortable for long periods and adapt to varying types of hearing loss.</p><p>It&#39;s easy to see why Apple might expand the AirPods&#39; usefulness, though. As with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">the Apple Watch</a>, health could be a selling point that grow the audience beyond the enthusiast core. It might also court a relatively underserved market of people who may have mild or moderate hearing loss, but either can&#39;t afford most hearing aids or don&#39;t like the limited functionality and drab designs that often define the category.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-health-device-leak-132037664.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">066803f7-d9d7-4501-b5dd-e0b0ebdef386</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:20:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634131150</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T13:19:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/989a1f60-12da-11eb-a5ff-730eaab52657" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/989a1f60-12da-11eb-a5ff-730eaab52657" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro in ears]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro in ears]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 review: It’s all about the screen]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="aeb9b088196a4fa4b92deb78f14e315f"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3F54aFTMhLU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The main difference between Apple’s Watch Series 7 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">the Series 6</a> is just a larger display, but it makes an outsized impact on a device as small as a watch. Apple also generally enlarged the UI, making things easier to read and navigate. To make better use of the bigger canvas, the company also added some new watch faces and a full QWERTY keyboard for replying to messages.</p><p>The other changes to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:the Series 7" href="https://amzn.to/3iXCNxT">the Series 7</a> are less obvious, like a new SiP (system-in-package), faster charging and overnight respiratory tracking. For those coming from the last generation, this might not feel like a significant upgrade. But the larger display does make a meaningful impact for anyone that’s upgrading from a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-review-watchos-7-price-specs-comparison-172542713.html">Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-24-apple-watch-series-5-review.html">Series 5</a> or older.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design and hardware</h2><p>Even though its screen is bigger, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-release-date-price-172920553.html">the Series 7</a> still manages to retain basically the same footprint as its predecessor. It’s a hair heavier than the Watch SE and Series 6, which makes sense since its case is slightly larger. Unlike previous generations, which came in 40 and 44mm sizes, this year you can choose between 41mm and 45mm. The difference is barely noticeable at first.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9761caa0-2b96-11ec-bffd-fddd7431d5dc" alt="An off-angle view of the Apple Watch Series 7 on a person&#39;s wrist, showing the screen&#39;s refracted edge and the watch&#39;s dial and button." data-uuid="bbaa17ff-6cb2-39cc-a85d-29dc0859f8b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Once I turned the screen on, though, I was struck by its roominess. This was when this main design change became obvious. Apple used a refractive edge here to make it seem like the display curves slightly along the sides and it helps the face feel even more expansive. The bezels have been whittled down to just 1.7mm (0.07 inch) compared to last gen’s 3mm.</p><p>Oh, and a quick shout here to its durability: It’s the first Apple Watch to be certified IP6X for dust resistance. Since I’m in reviewer mode, I&#39;ve been very careful to avoid situations where I might damage the device. But I’ll admit I’ve already dropped the Series 7 once and it survived without a scratch, thanks to Apple’s crystal covering that the company says is more crack resistant than on the Series 6.</p><p>Now, you’re probably not comparing an Apple Watch to Android or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">Wear OS</a>, but in case you were curious, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 4</a> is noticeably lighter than the Series 7. It also has a round face and thinner body. But really, if you’re an iPhone user, you’ve probably never even thought about a Galaxy watch.</p><h2>A big screen difference</h2><p>Depending on which Apple Watch you’d been using before, the jump in screen size may be less obvious. It’s increased more than 50 percent from the SE and 20 percent from the Series 6. Either way, the more spacious UI is helpful. Buttons for entering my passcode stretched out over the edges, and I didn&#39;t need to aim as carefully to strike the right keys. It&#39;s easier to hit the right settings in the control center, too, and I can see more of my friends’ messages at once. My heart rate and time passed during workouts are more readable as well. Those with visual impairments will also appreciate that there are new larger font size settings available.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed648510-2c26-11ec-9fdf-6858672c9558" style="height:1112;width:1639;" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" data-uuid="3230d43e-c6c7-3d6c-a561-ba7d52b65502"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Though most buttons are between 12 and 27 percent larger, app icons are still squished together. That’s a problem for those of us who use the grid view for all apps, but not so much if you’re in list view.</p><p>The extra space also means Apple was able to introduce a full QWERTY keyboard for replying to messages by typing or swiping on the screen. Compared to handwriting, dictating or emojis, a keyboard offers a bit more flexibility, especially when the system correctly picks up your swipes. But because it’s so cramped, the accuracy rate is <em>maybe</em> 60 percent, and I still preferred using dictation. Plus, the new screen may be big, but it’s definitely not big enough to make tap typing possible. Still, it’s a good option to have.</p><p>In addition to enlarging most of the elements across the UI, Apple also added new faces that can display more information at once, like the Modular Duo. There’s also a Contour style that pushes the clock’s digits all the way to the edge where they warp and “melt” over the sides like in Salvador Dali’s <em>The Persistence of Memory</em>. The remaining two are a Portrait face that we already saw in the watchOS 8 beta, and World Time, which is helpful for interacting with people in other countries. I used Modular Duo the most, though it’s not very attractive, and when I wanted something prettier I just switched to one with my face as the wallpaper instead. (Just kidding: I use the “Artist” design or a cute animal background.)</p><section data-eng-breakout="2b903d05d74b4e6b8d04e467648d0717" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed648510-2c26-11ec-af5f-1b44504099ed" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" data-uuid="9a8809c7-0765-3935-a87b-005d625b5f40"></section><p>The new Modular Duo screen is the most useful. It lets you place two expanded complications on top of each other, while still showing the time and an additional small complication at the top. You can choose to show the world clock with a timer or your favorite stock’s performance with Apple Music, for example. I went with a Spotify controller and the Weather forecast. Though the latter worked well, showing me hourly temperature and sunlight data on the screen, the Spotify complication was, in a word, trash. It just shows the words “Tap to play music,” and I’d have to waste a tap and a second to pull up playback controls.</p><p>A second doesn’t sound like much, but when I’m out running or juggling my groceries, I don’t want to waste that time holding up my arm and watching my screen for more than a fraction of a second. I’m not going to harp on this because this is more of a Spotify problem than an Apple Watch issue, but given how many people use the music app, it would do both companies good to make this complication work better. I’d love to see more useful complications from other apps too.</p><p>One last note on the Series 7’s screen: Though its actual peak brightness hasn’t changed, Apple has tweaked the system so that the Always On display is up to 70 percent brighter when you’re indoors. This way, it’s easier to read if you have your hand hidden below a table while you’re at a meeting.</p><h2>Battery life, charging and performance</h2><p>That pretty much sums up all the screen-related updates on the Series 7. But there are a few other noteworthy upgrades. The most significant of these is that it charges faster, and in about 10 minutes, I got close to 10 percent capacity. It reached almost 100 percent in under an hour with the new cable that Apple includes in the box. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch SE only got to about 60 percent in an hour.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f7478130-2b96-11ec-a1fb-7ab26f0589b0" alt="The new QWERTY keyboard on the Apple Watch Series 7." data-uuid="e57f1f38-3af0-34ef-a52d-80d4e446db6b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>You’ll need both the new charger and the Series 7 to get these faster charging speeds, by the way. It’s the coils on both the watch and the wireless disc that enable the higher rate, so this isn’t something you can get just by running out and buying a new accessory. As someone who’s constantly forgetting to charge my watch until I&#39;m about to run out the door, I appreciate the faster speeds. That said, I still wish smartwatches in general lasted longer and took less time to charge.</p><p>Speaking of the battery, the Series 7 promises the same runtime as its predecessor, which is to say, about 18 hours. I generally found myself getting about half a day more from the new watch than the SE, despite the lack of an Always On display on the SE. The Series 7 usually stuck around for a day and a half, almost two, with the screen set to Always On, and tracking between three and five workouts. I also used the device to send plenty of messages and map my walks while I ran errands with the GPS on. That endurance is impressive given the larger screen, but it’s worth noting that I haven’t used the watch for sleep tracking yet.</p><p>The battery efficiency can be partly attributed to Apple’s new S7 system-in-package (SIP), which is based on the same processor as the S6. In general, I didn’t feel much of a difference between the Series 7 and the SE when launching workouts or getting Siri to text my friends. The Apple Watch has been and continues to be a responsive device that feels as fast as, if not faster than, its Android counterparts.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/18adc460-2b97-11ec-88fb-058d5a0b0624" alt="The battery page on the Apple Watch Series 7." data-uuid="adae6ef5-c9d1-303b-a7c9-285d3100dd7d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p></p><h2>Sleep tracking, watchOS 8 and other updates</h2><p>One area where Apple continues to lag the competition is sleep tracking. While companies like Fitbit and Samsung can use their wearables’ heart rate monitors to detect what sleep zone you’re in, Apple still doesn’t offer that. And you’ll need to make sure you have the Sleep Focus mode on (either manually or by setting a schedule) before the Watch will log your slumber. The others are all able to automatically tell when you’ve gone to sleep and don’t need you to set a schedule. In fact, Fitbit has been doing it since 2015.</p><p>The Series 7 does usher in a new feature that logs your respiration rate while you sleep, and then tells you your breath-per-minute rate the next morning. Cool. Respiratory tracking is something that’s coming via watchOS 8 and isn’t exclusive to the Series 7, and the same is true of features like the new Mindfulness app, guided meditation sessions, redesigned Photos app, SharePlaying Fitness+ workouts and more. This means they’re less likely to sway your decision on whether to get the Series 7 if you already have an Apple Watch. The main things exclusive to the Series 7 are the Modular Duo and Contour watch faces, larger font sizes and buttons, and the QWERTY keyboard.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b370030-2b97-11ec-b7f3-7e614289c1b4" alt="The all apps page in grid view on the Apple Watch Series 7." data-uuid="8da67b38-07aa-3973-a561-f883c426c7b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p></p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>Though the differences between the Series 6 and 7 seem minor, it&#39;s worth a reminder that most people who own last year’s model likely aren’t looking to upgrade yet anyway. For anyone else who’s looking for a new smartwatch, the Series 7 will be a satisfying purchase, especially if you’ve never used one before. WatchOS is a capable and comprehensive system that can help you track your workouts, automatically log your sessions, prompt you to be more active and mindful of your mental health all while being a great extension of your smartphone. It’s not the best at sleep-tracking, though, so if that’s a priority you might prefer a Fitbit. Despite its relatively high starting price <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:of $400" href="https://amzn.to/3iXCNxT">of $400</a>, what Apple offers is currently the best in the market, especially for the iOS ecosystem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">61cd880b-921f-4f77-b6e6-955ff0f333d9</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:00:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634130711</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T13:11:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/76dc4a80-2b96-11ec-a6a6-1afca201cc47" width="1900" height="1267" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed61c5f0-2c26-11ec-bfff-fc22ded728bb" width="1861" height="1090" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600 is a $329 GPU for 1080p gaming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of July, AMD announced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-unveils-the-radeon-rx-6600-xt-gpu-designed-for-1080-p-gaming-033049778.html">Radeon RX 6600XT</a>, a video card the company billed as its 1080p flagship. For its final GPU release of 2021, it has unveiled the Radeon RX 6600. It&#39;s a video card that offers 28 compute units, a 2,044MHz game clock and up to 8GB of GDDR6 memory. On paper, that makes it only slightly less powerful than the RX 6600XT, which comes with 32 compute units, a 2,359MHz game clock and 8GB of GDDR6 RAM.</p><p>On average, AMD claims the RX 6600 is 23 percent faster than NVIDIA’s last generation RTX 2060 and about on par with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-release-date-185849067.html">RTX 3060</a> while delivering better per watt performance. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the company says players can expect an average of 70 frames per second at max settings in 1080p. In less visually demanding titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-release-date-may-7-2021-224214298.html"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitman-3-epic-games-store-exclusive-150053170.html"><em>Hitman 3</em></a><em>,</em> you can expect on average more than 100 frames per second, according to AMD.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Notably, AMD didn’t say how the RX 6600 performs in esports titles like <em>Valorant </em>and <em>Overwatch</em>. Presumably, it should be able to put up the kind of frame rates you need to drive a single Full HD monitor at 240Hz or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-nvidia-360hz-esports-display-gsync-asus-rog-swift-360.html">360Hz</a>. The more interesting tidbit about the RX 6600 is that it can play some games at 1440p. In <a href="https://www.engadget.com/far-cry-6-release-date-gameplay-trailer-182030303.html"><em>Far Cry 6</em></a>, for example, AMD says it’s possible to get a very playable 62 frames per second at the higher resolution.</p><p>The RX 6600 will also ship with ray-tracing support out of the box. Here the company claims you can get more than 60 frames per second while playing <em>Far Cry 6</em> at both 1080p and 1440p, provided you also take advantage of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unity-nvidia-dlss-support-game-engine-164535941.html">DLSS-like</a> FidelityFX Super Resolution upscaling technology. Ray-tracing performance has consistently been a weak point among AMD’s RDNA 2 GPUs, so we’ll have to see if the RX 6600 lives up to the claims.</p><p>One other point AMD was eager to get across is that RX 6600 only needs 132 watts of board power.

The Mac Mini M1 has an eight-core CPU and an eight-core GPU, plus a 16-core Neural Engine that handles machine learning tasks.

This was just after the advent of the company’s first iPhone Pro models with pro level features, like surgical-grade stainless steel and, er, three cameras. Fast-forward to now, just after the launch of the iPhone 13 series, and I still don’t have my USB-C iPhone. Fortunately, there are engineers that like a challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>On his YouTube channel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology student Ken Pillonel teased an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-usb-c-i-phone-becomes-a-reality-thanks-to-a-robotics-engineer-113556672.html">iPhone X with a USB-C port</a>, promising a full video later on how it was done.

Yes, this is not something most of us should attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s certainly possible for Apple to do the same, given the iPad Pro and new mini have USB-C ports.

Game director Andrei Van Roon and lead game producer Jeremy Lee wrote in their <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/disabling-all-chat/">announcement</a>, though, that at the moment, negative interactions outweigh the positives due to the rise of in-game verbal abuse this year.</p><p>Teams will still see the other&#39;s emotes and CTRL+1-2-3-4 spam, and the change doesn&#39;t affect the chat function between allies at all. Riot knows there&#39;s still verbal abuse going on within team chats, and that the move won&#39;t eliminate the behavior from the game completely. The developer deems team chats too important to disable, however, since that&#39;s what people use to strategize and coordinate their actions.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22722747/league-of-legends-all-chat-removed-patch-riot-games"><em>Polygon</em></a>, the reaction to the change has mostly been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/q6oi8k/riot_is_disabling_all_chat_in_all_matchmaking/">negative</a>, with people mentioning the fun experiences they&#39;ve had bonding with players from opposing teams. Some even claim that most toxic behavior happens within team chats instead. van Roon has since clarified on Twitter that the plan is to test the change for a couple of patches, starting with patch 11.21, and then ask players for feedback. Riot could choose to keep or reverse the change based on the feedback it gets, though it could also keep it in some regions where the response to it is largely positive</p><div id="42e00b0745464fc590f599ad1d946567"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A few more all chat test details:<br>- Plan is to test for a couple of patches, then survey player opinion<br>- Potential responses then include keeping the change, reverting it entirely, keeping it in regions positive on it and reverting elsewhere, changing which queues it applies to</p>— Andrei van Roon (@RiotMeddler) <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler/status/1447963125060276225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-disables-cross-team-chat-league-of-legends-103543917.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">57f223fc-7939-4f64-85ce-b883d9cc1dfd</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 10:35:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634120391</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T10:20:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bf2706e0-2c04-11ec-992f-5f3f1d0ade89" width="1600" height="935" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bf2706e0-2c04-11ec-992f-5f3f1d0ade89" width="1600" height="935" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[League of Legends]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[League of Legends]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Security flaws at NFT marketplace OpenSea left users' crypto wallets open to attack]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After finding itself embroiled in a controversy over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opensea-nate-chastain-nft-buying-incident-163044364.html">insider trading</a>, NFT marketplace OpenSea is getting some more bad press. The site had a critical security vulnerability that could have allowed hackers to steal users&#39; entire crypto wallets, according to security research firm Check Point Software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Check Point said it first noticed reports of stolen crypto wallets triggered by airdropped NFTs, prompting the firm to investigate OpenSea. That revealed critical security discoveries &quot;that, if exploited, could have led hackers to hijack user accounts and steal entire crypto wallets of users, by sending malicious NFTs,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The attack relied on user inattention and the fact that OpenSea already generates a lot of pop-ups. If the victim received and viewed a malicious NFT sent by a hacker, it triggered a pop-up from OpenSea&#39;s storage domain, requesting a connection to the victim&#39;s cryptocurrency wallet. Clicking on the popup gave the hacker access to the wallet and allowed them to generate another popup. If the user also clicked on that without noticing a note describing the transaction, the attacker could theoretically steal all their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It seemed that a lot of things needed to go wrong for the attack to work, and it&#39;s not clear if it was actively exploited. Check Point said it disclosed the vulnerability as soon as it found it, and OpenSea said it implemented a fix &quot;within an hour of it being brought to our attention.&quot; The company said it&#39;s &quot;doubling down on community education around security,&quot; by adding a blog series and taking other measures.&nbsp;</p><p>The security research firm said that given the rapid pace of innovation, &quot;there is an inherent challenge in securely integrating software applications and crypto markets.&quot; Bad actors are also drawn to crypto like wasps to <em>pain au chocolat</em>, so it&#39;s likely we&#39;ll hear about similar attacks in the near future.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/open-sea-vulnerability-exposed-crypto-wallets-to-attack-security-researchers-say-100028216.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">462e6101-7c8c-4890-bc68-0745484c031d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 10:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634118971</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T09:56:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2d0bd7f0-124f-11ec-9d5b-406f59cf7dbc" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2d0bd7f0-124f-11ec-9d5b-406f59cf7dbc" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OpenSea logo displayed on a phone screen and representation of cryptocurrencies are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on August 26, 2021.

Netflix has acquired the global streaming rights for all 26 episodes of the anime, and they&#39;ll be available for streaming starting on October 21st, just a few weeks before the November 19th debut of the live series&#39; first season. The <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> anime first premiered in Japan in 1998 before making its way to the US via Adult Swim three years later.

Right up there with the MPC and the Technics SL-1200. They’ve been used by the likes of MF Doom, Madlib and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-21-hip-hop-producer-j-dillas-beat-making-gear-headed-to-smithsonia.html">J Dilla</a>, and are a favorite among lo-fi hip hop artists everywhere. They’ve also been used by plenty of other musicians like Panda Bear, Four Tet, Oneohtrix Point Never and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/radiohead-and-epic-games-team-up-for-the-kid-a-mnesia-exhibit-215738766.html">Radiohead</a>. But, the original SP-404 was released in 2005. And even though it was succeeded by the 404SX and the 404A, those were extremely minor updates that did things like switch from the aging and slow CF Card format to SD. The new SP-404MKII, though, finally updates the classic sampler for the modern age without sacrificing what made the OG so alluring.</p><p>Physically, the 404MKII is very similar to past versions of the 404. There are four knobs across the top; a circular window below them, flanked by six effects buttons; and pads on the bottom for triggering samples. The MKII does look better than the A, at least. The 404A was designed to fit in with the rest of Roland’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-08-roland-system-8-review.html">AIRA</a> line — that means stark black accented with garish red and green. It’s… a look. But not one that everyone (myself included) can get behind. The new version is a much more subdued gray and black, with white and muted orange accents.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e655dc22-2b99-11ec-bd2e-300f8eed39bb" alt="Roland SP-404MKII" data-uuid="297f989a-8c44-35bc-af54-931097124bc6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Beyond pure aesthetics, though, there are some huge upgrades in the MKII. The two most obvious differences are the detailed OLED screen that has replaced the old-school seven-segment LEDs, and the move from a 12-pad layout to a 16-pad one.</p><p>The screen represents the biggest change to the SP experience. Editing samples on an OG 404 could be painful. The three-digit LEDs gave you only generic start and end points, and because of the high resolution needed to create perfect loops, the range was very small. That would lead to having to crop a sample multiple times to take off all the excess. The OLED on the SP-404MKII is high enough resolution to show the actual waveform as it’s being edited. You can zoom in and out as needed to crop as little or as much as you want. I would go as far as to say that recording and editing samples on the MKII is not only easier, but actually kinda fun.</p><p>The 16 pads give you access to more samples and patterns to construct your beats out of. Also, the four-by-four grid has become something of a standard. It’s the layout used by Akai on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-live-ii-review-153032772.html">MPC</a>, on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-01-serato-pioneer-ddj-xp2.html">Pioneer’s DJ gear</a>, on the Native Instruments <a href="https://www.engadget.com/maschine-plus-native-instruments-virtual-instruments-groovebox-155725975.html">Maschine</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-daw-hands-on-review-upgrades-explained-160047192.html">Ableton’s</a> Drum Rack and even some of the larger members of the SP family like the 808 and the 606.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e6381af1-2b99-11ec-aef9-bb59674b367a" alt="Roland SP-404MKII" data-uuid="d7915590-1719-3af6-80e1-0e4a1b635278"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are other more subtle changes as well. For one, those 16 pads on the front are all velocity sensitive, a first for the SP line. That said, it’s almost impossible to get full velocity out of them without just turning on fixed velocity. Some finger drummers especially may prefer to turn fixed velocity on to keep melodic and percussion elements consistently mixed, but it can also leave things sounding a bit robotic and unnatural. Just something to keep in mind.</p><p>Roland added MIDI out to the back of the SP-404MKII as well. The previous versions had MIDI IN only. Now the 404 can be used to sequence external gear, or even be hooked up to a PC to control your DAW via USB-C. That makes the 16-pad layout even more important, because it’ll map better to whatever you’re connecting it to most likely. Oh. and that USB port can also be used to stream audio to your PC.</p><p>This also marks the first time that Roland has ditched RCA in favor of ¼-inch jacks for the audio ins and outs on an SP. Now, this is a net positive but there is a down side. Often an SP is being used to sample directly from vinyl and most turntables use RCA. That means there will be an intermediary step to getting loops from a record to the 404. But, it does make it easier to sample directly from an instrument. Synths, drum machines, guitars and basses all generally use ¼-inch plugs. And, since the ins and outs on the MKII are balanced, it should be less susceptible to noise and interference.</p><section data-eng-breakout="0ff984f5f11048709b8c78139a78d03f" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e655dc24-2b99-11ec-bfcb-c7d1b2efe790" alt="Roland SP-404MKII"></section><p>In addition to the ins and outs around back, there’s a pair of headphone jacks on the front (one ⅛-inch, and one ¼-inch) and a ¼-inch audio input. That jack is switchable from mic to “guitar” or instrument level signals. You can feed audio through the SP-404MKII live so you can use it as a submixer and jam or sing along to your creations. And there are a host of input effects tailored specifically for that application. There’s a pretty decent guitar amp sim that covers everything from clean funk to thrash metal, an auto pitch correction effect, and a vocoder. For the latter, you can connect a MIDI keyboard to play chords and melodies.</p><p>In general, the MKII offers a lot more in the effects department than past models. In addition to the input effects, there’s a pair of bus effects. You can apply one, both or neither to each pad. Put a compressor on your drums, EQ on your bass and both on your rhodes if you want. And there are a pair of background effects, too.</p><p>If you dive into the settings you’ll find Bus 3 and 4 where you can apply master effects. In that same menu is where you can also customize the “direct” effects that are assigned to the six buttons around the display. So, for example, if you don’t like or use the resonator, you can swap in the new cassette simulator, which is what I did. (Though the button will continue to be labeled “resonator” no matter what you do.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e6320071-2b99-11ec-8a36-5ec440d23b13" alt="Roland SP-404MKII" data-uuid="1e39058d-425f-382f-83e1-4889248b8032"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The selection of effects is pretty large, too, and it definitely leans into the lo-fi vibe that SP users are generally looking for. In addition to the new cassette simulator (which has a cute, but questionably useful catch feature that simulates the tape getting stuck momentarily), there’s also a lo-fi effect, a bit crusher and the vinyl simulator from both the 303 and the 404. Many SP users swear by the 303 simulator, and I can’t say I blame them. The 404 version is just a bit too extreme and the noise is too constant and frankly kind of annoying even at low levels. The 303 version, however, is amazing.</p><p>If there’s one complaint I have about the effects, it’s that none of them are really subtle. The filter + drive, for example, is great and one of the many things people make heavy use of on the 404, but the drive is <em>intense</em>. Even on one it makes a huge difference in the sound of a loop. And by 10 it’s already introducing ringing feedback. By 100 it’s just noise. (Not that that’s necessarily a bad thing.)</p><p>One of the things that people really like to use those effects for is resampling beats and even mixing down full tracks to individual pads. (That’s how strong the appeal of the 303 vinyl sim and compressor are.) You can even use the MKII’s new DJ mode to blend between two beats while applying those effects. That said, I haven’t really put this through its paces.</p><section data-eng-breakout="55f5fb9fff58424db54b4aaae31f4da3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e6320074-2b99-11ec-b4fa-1fd82d97c78c" alt="Roland SP-404MKII"></section><p>Resampling is also incredibly easy. For one, there’s a clearly labeled resample button, which the original 404 had as well, so it was never particularly unintuitive. But there’s also now a Skip Back feature (though, you have to assign the subpad to in the utility menu), which recalls the last 25 seconds of audio performed either on the device or from the inputs and saves it to a pad. This is great for capturing live performance and moments of inadvertent genius.</p><p>And you can capture those moments anywhere you want basically. While the 404 isn’t exactly the smallest device in the world, it fits in a bag easily enough. And you can still power it with six AA batteries like previous models. And just like the previous versions the SP-404MKII is affordable. In fact, Roland cut the price by $50 so a brand new SP will only set you back $500 when it goes on sale in November.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e6486ea0-2b99-11ec-be2f-b91eba36b642" alt="Roland SP-404MKII" data-uuid="2d6a757f-bbb8-3e29-965d-25fb8387630a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>That makes it a perfectly reasonable purchase for a first-time producer or someone  looking to dabble in sampling. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/circuit-rhythm-review-a-solid-and-affordable-sampler-groovebox-130026004.html">Novation Circuit Rhythm</a> is $100 cheaper, but I think the effects on the SP are better and the screen makes for a much more pleasant chopping experience. Honestly, the screen alone is probably worth the extra hundred bucks.</p><p>There are even more affordable options like the Elektron Model:Samples, but you can’t actually record and edit samples on that, only play them back. And there are no standalone MPCs in this price range. The $799 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-15-akai-mpc-one-sampler-beat-production-namm.html">MPC One</a> is the cheapest member of the family, but it’s also a lot more complex than all these other devices; it’s closer to a DAW in a box than a sampler.</p><p>One thing those all have over the SP, though, is a step sequencer. That probably isn’t a huge deal to most people already eyeing a 404. But it’s something to keep in mind if rhythm isn’t your strong suit.</p><section data-eng-breakout="1580557368ae4106afa33d05aa3e6f07" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e6381af3-2b99-11ec-a96b-1b6753d883d8" alt="Roland SP-404MKII"></section><p>Considering that I’ve had it for less than a week and this is my first time using an SP device, I’m hesitant to call this a proper review and slap a score on it. But the SP-404MKII is undeniably fun to use and it’s quickly becoming my favorite entry-level sampler.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roland-sp-404-mkii-hands-on-dragging-an-iconic-sampler-into-the-modern-age-070043439.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f792e4e5-926b-463d-8c7e-ebda70f98844</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 07:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634127522</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T12:18:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e6475d32-2b99-11ec-bff9-2850785fbfaf" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e655dc21-2b99-11ec-bffb-83a8c34ddafd" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roland SP-404MKII]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roland SP-404MKII]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bowers & Wilkins' new Zeppelin speaker was built for streaming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Bowers &amp; Wilkins has launched a new version of its iconic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-08-bowers-and-wilkins-zeppelin-wireless.html">Zeppelin speaker</a>, and the company says it was re-imagined for the streaming age. The audio device manufacturer describes the <a href="https://www.bowerswilkins.com/new-zeppelin">new Zeppelin</a> as &quot;smarter and more flexible&quot; than its predecessors, with built-in support for Amazon&#39;s Alexa voice assistant, so users can simply ask it to play whatever they want instead of using its physical buttons. In addition, B&amp;W plans to give it multi-room capability in early 2022 through a software update.

The company has used it to unify the look and feel of its apps and services across various platforms. According to Verkoeyen, Google shifted its open source iOS Material component libraries into maintenance mode earlier this year after it conducted a “deep evaluation” of what it means to build a “hallmark” Google experience on iOS. What it found was that many of the custom elements it started building nearly a decade ago to fill gaps in UIKit’s design language are no longer necessary.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“With the introduction of SwiftUI and significant UIKit improvements in iOS 14+, it’s never been easier to build a great branded experience with a tiny amount of code,” Verkoeyen said.&nbsp;</p><p>With the shift to UIKit, Verkoeyen expects his team will spend less time building custom code, which should hopefully lead to faster and more frequent releases. Additionally, the use of UIKit should allow the company to more tightly integrate its software into iOS. However, those benefits may pale in comparison to the fact the company’s apps may end up looking more at home on Apple devices.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-material-design-uikit-171651054.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42af7c33-97f5-4c1c-9a7b-d3b998ec27ca</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 12 Oct 2021 17:16:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634059015</ingested><modified>2021-10-12T17:16:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-05/4b726be0-9aa6-11ea-b7ef-c6c327e6cecf" width="3704" height="2469" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-05/4b726be0-9aa6-11ea-b7ef-c6c327e6cecf" width="3704" height="2469" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Trutschel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - APRIL 22: The logo of the online map service Goolge Maps is shown on the display of a smartphone on April 22, 2020 in Berlin, Germany.

The initial Hexamove lineup includes two models: Lite and Pro. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/v-moda"><ins>V-Moda</ins></a> says you&#39;ll get up to six hours of use on a single charge. The included charging case will bump up the playback time by 18 hours in total. The hexagonal earbuds have 6mm drivers that deliver what V-Moda describes as &quot;powerful bass, vibrant mids and pristine highs,&quot; though there&#39;s no <a href="https://www.engadget.com/v-moda-m-200-anc-headphones-announced-price-specs-shipping-080007207.html"><ins>active noise cancellation</ins></a>.</p><p>The Hexamove Lite buds are available in three colors: red, white and black. There are three fitting options as well. As for Hexamove Pro, there are six custom fitting options (though it&#39;s only available in black or white). V-Moda says you&#39;ll be able to mix and match fins, ear-hooks and three in-ear fittings to discover the right combo for your ears. You can also attach the earbuds to a neck strap and stabilizer to prevent you from losing them. In addition, you&#39;ll be able to customize audio on the Pro earbuds using the equalizer tool in the V-Moda app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The brand says both models are IPX5-rated for sweat, water and dust resistance.

The invitation for the virtual &quot;Unleashed&#39; presentation doesn&#39;t provide many clues, although many unofficially expect Apple to introduce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-new-macbook-pro-2021-m-1-x-152614042.html">14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro</a> based on souped-up M1X processors.</p><p>The new portables are rumored to be significant redesigns that also harken back to the &quot;good old days&quot; of Apple&#39;s pre-2016 models. While they&#39;d have cutting-edge designs, they&#39;d also bring back <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-2021-macbook-pro-may-mark-the-return-of-the-mag-safe-connector-091548032.html">MagSafe-like charging</a> and legacy ports like an SD card slot. To no one&#39;s surprise, the M1X would also be far more powerful than the M1 with 10 CPU cores (eight performance and two efficiency) and either 16 or 32 graphics cores. There&#39;s a chance Apple might drop the Touch Bar, too, and it&#39;s safe to presume you&#39;ll hear about a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html">macOS Monterey</a> release date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These might not be the only introductions, either. Apple might introduce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-generation-leak-205121774.html">third-generation &#39;basic&#39; AirPods</a>, and we wouldn&#39;t rule out other M1X-based products (like a high-end Mac mini) or new and expanded services. Unlike last year, Apple might not spread announcements across three events — this may be the company&#39;s last chance to make a big splash before 2021 is over.</p><div id="e2dfc40330904dc3ab795ed4718c2e18"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Unleashed!
