At the same time, it&#39;s roughly based on the A5000 and A6000-series APS-C mirrorless cameras, with all the good (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-sony-a6600-review-misstep.html">and bad</a>) that entails.&nbsp;</p><p>The two biggest advantages of the ZV-E10 over the ZV-1 are the larger 24-megapixel APS-C sensor and interchangeable mirrorless mount. The latter feature opens Sony&#39;s range of 60-plus E-mount lenses to vloggers, making the ZV-E10 much more versatile than the fixed-lens ZV-1. The larger sensor, meanwhile, will deliver improved light sensitivity and a shallower depth of field.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ZV-E10 uses the aging 24-megapixel APS-C sensor found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-sony-a6100-review.html">A6100</a> and other recent Sony models. While that delivers sharp, downsampled 4K video at up to 30 fps (or 120 fps 1080p), it&#39;s likely to have a serious amount of rolling shutter that&#39;s not ideal for its intended purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>On the more positive side, it offers optical and active electronic image stabilization, just like the ZV-1. That should smooth out handheld shooting pretty well, though don&#39;t expect miracles for walk-and-talk type vlogging — especially if rolling sensor wobble proves to be an issue.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a14d7970-eee6-11eb-b71f-10e5cec50520" style="height:664;width:1500;" alt="Sony&#x002019;s ZV-E10 brings interchangeable lenses to its vlogging camera series" data-uuid="20814bd5-378d-3b0e-b1f5-21a1b5cda516"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Size-wise, the ZV-E10 is smaller than any of the A6000-series cameras and isn&#39;t much larger and heavier than the ZV-1. It lacks an electronic viewfinder, but it&#39;s Sony&#39;s first APS-C mirrorless camera with a fully-articulating flip-out screen — a basic requirement on any vlogging camera these days.&nbsp;</p><p>The ZV-E10 comes with Sony&#39;s latest phase-detect autofocus system, both for video and still shooting. That means you should get incredibly quick subject tracking, along with reliable eye, face and head detect autofocus. It also has an S&amp;Q (slow &amp; quick) feature that lets you record time-lapse and slow motion footage in-camera without the need for any post processing work.</p><p>It borrows several vlogging features directly from the ZV-1. The first is called &quot;product showcase,&quot; a setting that allows it to instantly focus away from your face and onto an object placed in front of the camera. That&#39;s particularly handy for vloggers reviewing products, devices, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>The other is a bokeh switch that instantly sets the lowest f-stop available for lighting conditions. That way, you can have the background as defocused as possible, allowing your subject to stand out clearly.&nbsp;</p><p>The ZV-E10 has a built-in, high-quality three-way microphone (left, right and central channels) that&#39;s designed to pick out your voice. That means you can vlog without the need to buy a microphone, though it still won&#39;t match the quality and voice isolation of a dedicated shotgun or lapel mic. It also comes with a  hotshoe-attached muff to help block wind noise, and if that&#39;s not enough, a wind noise reduction setting. It also comes with a microphone input, though not a headphone output.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, if you&#39;re into live streaming, you can connect the ZV-E10 directly to a smartphone and stream directly to YouTube or other services — much as you can with Panasonic&#39;s latest GH5-II. It will also work directly as a webcam, streaming both video and audio (not just video like other cameras) so you can take advantage of its high-quality microphone.&nbsp;</p><p>The ZV-E10 will be available in either black or white by the end of August and will cost $700 for the body, or $800 in a bundle including Sony&#39;s 16-50mm F/3.5-5.6 power zoom lens.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-expands-its-vlogging-lineup-with-the-zv-e-10-mirrorless-camera-142731045.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">577fe4f2-52a3-44c5-9a74-779ead57cb8f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:27:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627396053</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T14:27:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fa4f3060-eee4-11eb-b7ff-403a8562b927" width="1078" height="618" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fa4f3060-eee4-11eb-b7ff-403a8562b927" width="1078" height="618" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony Electronics Inc.]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Interchangeable-Lens Vlog Camera ZV-E10 for Vloggers and Video Creators]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony expands its vlogging lineup with the ZV-E10 mirrorless camera]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AZIO’s colorful IZO collection looks great (and that’s about it)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With tech pretty much everywhere in our lives these days, some people would prefer it matched their personal style and decor. But sometimes practicality gets left behind, resulting in products that look good but don’t work so well. Here at Engadget, for example, we’ve tested a few fancy keyboards that didn’t offer the best typing experience. But despite our misgivings, these “fashion” keyboards continue to be popular with social media influencers. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:AZIO&#x002019;s new IZO collection" href="https://fave.co/3iBAZJQ">AZIO’s new IZO collection</a>, out this summer, tries to be both fashion forward and functional, and it succeeds — to a point.</p><p>The collection has three main components, all of them wireless: a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:AZIO;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:IZO keyboard" href="https://fave.co/3y10Y3V">$140</a> mechanical keyboard; a $70 number pad that also functions as a standalone calculator; and a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:IZO mouse" href="https://fave.co/2UGPTXk">$50</a> mouse. There’s also a matching wrist rest and desk pad. The items are sold separately, and you can snag them in either white, blue or pink. I opted to receive my review units in “baroque rose” because it really is a nice shade of pink, in contrast to the bubble gum shades favored by companies like Razer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d8204ed0-ebeb-11eb-bf98-a6529571c374" alt="Mouse, keypad, keyboard" data-uuid="d64acaec-1691-3efc-b695-1085ff682358"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Regardless of which color you choose, each accessory is embellished with gold accents The keyboard, media dial, escape key and spacebar are all gilded and glossy. They stand out against the matte plastic used on the rest of the deck, and not in a good way. I also suspect that after several months of use, the coating is going to wear away and it’s not going to be pretty.</p><p>The keys are squircle shaped and lightly textured, so they at least feel nice to the touch. The typing… isn’t horrible. It’s actually perfectly fine, with good tactile bounce and a soft click with every press. But despite the blue mechanical switches it still feels a bit spongy compared to the other decks I have here in my office. I’m typing this hands-on with the IZO and it’s fine, but given a choice I’d switch back to my standards in a heartbeat. The IZO feels like a toy, which is disconcerting when I’m here to work. It’s a tenkeyless deck, which makes it great for tight spaces and taking on the go, though I wouldn’t slip it in my bag for fear of scratching it up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f88d8c00-ebeb-11eb-9edf-cc7ba5a6621b" alt="AZIO IZO keyboard in pink" data-uuid="ea78ee88-f5fa-3c88-98a6-e270d5ef62e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you need a number pad, that’ll cost extra. Seventy dollars is kind of steep for those 18 extra keys, and the fact that it can also be used as a calculator doesn’t make the cost sting any less.I will say this for it, though: I love this thing. Not because I use the number pad to do calculations (though I do), but because it’s just so fun to play with. I don’t have it connected or even turned on right now, I just like to randomly pick it up in both hands and play with the buttons. I may find the typing experience a little subpar, but as a fidget toy the numpad is great because it’s just so chunky and clicky, perfect for keeping my hands busy during boring Zoom calls.</p><p>The final piece of the set is the wireless mouse, the most beautiful of the three desk accessories. It’s a rounded rectangular shape, with a gold scroll wheel and stripe across the middle of the mouse, below which is a frosted white plastic bearing the AZIO logo. This is the kind of mouse that could strut around Milan Fashion Week or the beach at Ibiza. Unfortunately, it’s pretty bad as a computing accessory.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17457810-ebec-11eb-bed7-77d267021af3" alt="AZIO IZO mouse in pink" data-uuid="420226aa-020e-303e-aff5-680eca33dcb8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s the hand feel that’s an immediate turnoff. Where most mice curve inward and down on the end facing the user, the better to fit in your palm, the AZIO mouse is straight all the way down, with the rear of the mouse at the same height as the middle. It’s actually one of the smallest mice I’ve tested, but it feels huge in my hand. That’s a big no-no considering it’s a fashion peripheral, presumably meant to appeal to women, who usually have smaller mitts than men.</p><p>The design faux pas don’t end there, either. The DPI button is placed on the bottom of the mouse and it’s a tiny little nub that’s hard to hit, so once you’ve picked a setting you’ll probably want to stick with it. And the pads on bottom have a little too much friction on them to slide across my desk easily. I probably should use a mouse pad with this thing but I haven’t needed one in almost a decade and I don’t see why I should go back now.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/344c31b0-ebec-11eb-bd7b-d68e796f48c5" alt="AZIO IZO keypad in pink" data-uuid="4bb8ed89-0108-3aec-bc5d-5854cedd0cee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>I wouldn’t recommend the mouse and the cost of the number pad is a bit too steep for me to tell you to buy it — even at the currently discounted price of $40. The keyboard is also on sale for $80, which is a little more tempting. But if the color was your main reason for buying it, note that Logitech’s K380 comes in a fetching pale pink, can connect to up to three devices wirelessly and is only <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech K380" href="https://amzn.to/3kQ9CyC">$40</a>. You also have your choice of mice to match, including the stellar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-anywhere-3-mouse-price-specs-availability-070104068.html">MX Anywhere 3</a>. The IZO collection is for people who absolutely need to have a stylish <em>mechanical</em> keyboard — and even then, you might be better off just buying a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Corsair K70" href="https://amzn.to/2W5yjfS">white deck</a> from a company like Corsair and customizing the LEDs to your favorite shade.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/azio-izo-collection-keyboard-mouse-140016265.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93c84e38-cbe1-4944-956a-df8b2cebbfe0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627395146</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T14:12:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7efbd6c0-eee4-11eb-bfef-2237ad004883" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7efbd6c0-eee4-11eb-bfef-2237ad004883" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kris Naudus / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AZIO IZO keyboard and mouse peripherals photographed on a black cloth background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AZIO IZO keyboard and mouse]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok hopes new tools will create kinder, gentler live streams]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TikTok wants to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-streamlabs-live-streaming-integration-165006138.html">encourage more livestreams</a>, and that now includes creating a friendlier environment for the hosts. The social video giant is <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-live-features-2021">rolling out</a> a string of new features that include tools to promote kindness. For a start, TikTok will now pop up an alert if you&#39;re about to post a comment the company deems &quot;potentially unkind or harmful.&quot; You can press forward if you&#39;re determined, but TikTok clearly hopes you&#39;ll reconsider any personal attacks.</p><p>Accordingly, the hosts will have more power as well. You can assign a trusted moderator before you start a stream, letting you focus on the show instead of blocking and muting trolls. You can now add up to 200 entries to the keyword filter. In the &quot;coming weeks,&quot; you&#39;ll also have ways for both hosts and viewers to both delete comments and temporarily mute viewers. Someone who committed a minor offense can have a shot at redemption, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s also a focus on improved discovery. An addition rolling out &quot;soon&quot; will improve your ability to find livestreams from the For You and Following pages, not to mention provider quicker access to top and recommended live videos. TikTok also recently launched a scheduling tool for hosts, picture-in-picture viewing and a &quot;Go Live Together&quot; feature that lets two people start broadcasting at the same time.</p><p>The focus on livestreams doesn&#39;t come as a shock. TikTok noted that the number of people hosting and watching live video had &quot;doubled&quot; over the past year, and some of its biggest events have involved livestreams. The Weeknd played a concert through the platform, for instance. While looping videos remain TikTok&#39;s core, the company is more than a little eager to challenge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-venue-app-second-screen-130026040.html">Facebook</a>, Instagram and other services where live video is also growing in popularity.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-live-stream-kindness-discovery-tools-133912505.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c8adade0-c520-497f-923d-b734e9638b16</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:39:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627392862</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T13:34:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a75479d0-eed8-11eb-adf7-bb0375634715" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a75479d0-eed8-11eb-adf7-bb0375634715" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TikTok]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TikTok livestream comment kindness feature]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TikTok livestream comment kindness feature]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nothing's Ear 1 wireless earbuds arrive on August 17th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Nothing">Nothing</a>, the hardware startup from OnePlus co-founder <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carl-pei-leaving-oneplus-235552807.html">Carl Pei</a>, has officially unveiled its first product: the Ear 1 wireless earbuds.

Netflix actually lost 433,000 subscribers in the US and Canada during its second quarter, while Disney is reportedly <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/disney-u-s-growth-slows-sharply-in-first-half-of-2021-internal-data-shows">struggling</a>, too. But, overseas is another story. Thanks to cheap <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-mobile-edition-bharti-airtel-india-111531193.html">mobile-only</a> plans that cater to local viewing habits, streaming services are making gains in places like Asia. Netflix, which has a low-end tier in India that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-netflix-mobile-only-plans-india.html">costs $2.67</a>, nabbed just over a million subscribers in Asia-Pacific in its latest quarter. Now, Disney is looking to build on its mammoth success in India with its own mobile streaming plan that costs $6.70 per year.</p><p>Having rebranded its local service to Disney+ Hotstar last Spring, the company is introducing three tiers in total. Aside from mobile, which lets you watch on one mobile device in HD, there&#39;s Super for $12.08 per year (two devices including mobile, the web and more in HD) and Premium for $20.14 per year (four devices in 4K). The three plans will come into effect on September 1st, Disney announced at a virtual event, according to <a href="https://gadgets.ndtv.com/entertainment/news/hotstar-disney-plus-india-plans-new-mobile-super-premium-499-899-1499-year-annual-2495963"><em>NDTV</em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Though it&#39;s the opposite of the single monthly and yearly plan Disney+ offers in the US and elsewhere, the shakeup makes sense for India. Going mobile-only sees the company following a tried and tested model aimed at the large chunk of the local population that use mobiles to connect to the internet. The launch also comes just weeks ahead of Disney&#39;s latest earnings report on August 12th, where all eyes will be on Disney+ subscriber numbers.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-india-mobile-plan-130852534.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02f4d768-0204-4e76-95f2-ccd3c932cebc</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:08:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627391334</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T13:09:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cd3b280-eed7-11eb-aefd-07b5af5acea7" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cd3b280-eed7-11eb-aefd-07b5af5acea7" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SPAIN - 2021/07/08: In this photo illustration, a Disney+ Hotstar logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

With the change, advertisers will no longer be able to use “interests” or information gleaned from other services to show ads to Facebook, Instagram and Messenger’s youngest users.</p><p>The change won’t prevent advertisers from reaching teens at all — they can still use broad demographic information like age, gender, and location — but the update will prevent more granular data from being used, including info from<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-20-facebook-shared-data-controls.html"><ins> third-party</ins></a> websites and apps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Instagram is also making several changes to make teens on its platform less visible. The app will begin making new accounts private by default for teens younger than 16, though teens as young as 13 can still opt for a public-facing account if they wish. Instagram said that in early tests “eight out of ten young people accepted the private default settings during sign-up,” suggesting the change could lead more teens to have non-public accounts.</p><p>For teens who do opt for public accounts, Instagram is making it more difficult for adults they don’t know to interact with them in the app. The company says it has “developed new technology” that makes it easier to identify “potentially suspicious behavior” in adults who could pose a risk to teens.</p><p>According to Instagram, adults flagged as “potentially suspicious” will be blocked from following teens or commenting on their posts (the app has previously limited adults ability <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-restricts-adult-dms-to-teens-140416475.html"><ins>to direct message</ins></a> teens). These adults also won’t see content from teens in Reels, Explore and other in-app recommendations. The company isn’t sharing many details about how it determines which adults might be sketchy, but said one factor would be adults who get blocked or reported by younger users.</p><p>The changes come as Instagram is vying for younger users. The company has publicly discussed future plans for a version of its service <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faceboo-making-an-instagram-for-children-under-13-053133204.html">for children</a> younger than 13 years old. That idea, which the company has said is in early stages, has already prompted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-letter-instagram-for-kids-200635143.html"><ins>pushback</ins></a> from lawmakers and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-for-kids-pushback-from-us-attorneys-general-155919010.html">other officials</a>. But Facebook is still pushing ahead with the idea. In a separate blog post, the company again said it plans to work with experts in child development and online safety as it creates the service, and that it welcomes &quot;productive collaboration with lawmakers.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-limit-targeted-ads-teens-130055774.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c1210f9a-6711-435b-8e91-9ec1a70feba3</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 13:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627346432</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T00:41:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cultural Groups]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b45768e0-ee6f-11eb-afeb-3d64c881ad41" width="4437" height="2958" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b45768e0-ee6f-11eb-afeb-3d64c881ad41" width="4437" height="2958" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DeFodi Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[KIRCHHEIM UNTER TECK, GERMANY - MARCH 09: (BILD ZEITUNG OUT) In this photo illustration, The Facebook and Instagram logos on the screen of an iPhone on March 09, 2021 in Kirchheim unter Teck, Germany.

As the company did with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-09-master-and-dynamic-mw07-plus-review.html">its MW07 model</a>, another version of the MW08 is making its debut today. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:MW08 Sport" href="https://fave.co/3771O3j">MW08 Sport</a> offers all of the features that make the MW08 so good, including 12-hour battery life, excellent sound quality and improved active noise cancellation (ANC). This new Sport option is made with different materials, has more ear tips in the box and it comes with a wireless charging case. However, the additions tack $50 onto the price.</p><p>Instead of the ceramic and aluminum combo that we saw on the MW08, the MW08 Sport pairs the metal accents with sapphire glass. Master &amp; Dynamic says the new material is scratch and shatter resistant which the company argues gives these earbuds the ability &quot;to withstand any workout.&quot; Like the previous version, the MW08 Sport is IPX5 rated, which means they should withstand a sweat session with no issues. There are also some changes for the MW08 Sport&#39;s charging case. The company&#39;s familiar shiny stainless steel was a fingerprint magnet and it didn&#39;t take much for it to begin showing scratches. That material has been replaced with Kevlar fiber, so the case has a more tactile soft-touch coating with a black and gray pattern. And, of course, it should also be more durable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/74589590-ee7c-11eb-b7fe-98a451dac12b" alt="Master &amp; Dynamic MW08 Sport" data-uuid="05d242b2-0969-30c2-8f43-822de5fb4a67"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Master &amp; Dynamic</div></figure><p>More importantly, the included case now supports wireless charging, which is likely the primary cause for the price increase. As you might expect, Master &amp; Dynamic made its own pad to support this feature, an accessory that will debut alongside the MW08 Sport <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:for $69 (&#x0020ac;69/&#xa3;59)" href="https://fave.co/3zHpKX4">for $69 (€69/£59)</a>. The company says wireless charging for the case itself will give you 50 percent battery in 30 minutes and a full charge will take just over an hour and a half. Compare that to 15 minutes for half or an hour for a full charge with a USB-C cable. Charging times for the earbuds in the case are unchanged from the MW08: 50 percent in 15 minutes and an hour for a complete top off.&nbsp;</p><p>The last big change for the MW08 Sport is the selection of ear tips. Like the MW08, Master &amp; Dynamic gives you five sets of silicone tips to help you find the best fit. For the Sport model, the company is also throwing in two sizes of foam tips that offer a more secure fit for workouts. Based on my experience using the MW08 Sport for the last week, the foam tips are more comfortable than the silicone options too.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/27ccd9b0-ee46-11eb-ab2a-a11a57fae78c" alt="Master &amp; Dynamic MW08 Sport" data-uuid="28c4ccbd-db75-3c1b-9806-372318c1ee4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Master &amp; Dynamic</div></figure><p>Inside, the MW08 Sport is unchanged from the the MW08. The earbuds pack 11mm Beryllium-coated drivers to power their stellar sound. Dual-mode ANC returns, giving you the option of blocking as much of the world as possible (ANC Max) or a setting for &quot;less noisy&quot; spots (All Day ANC). The company&#39;s two ambient sound modes are also back, with one dedicated to conversation and the other suited for more general use. The only bummer here is you still have to choose your ANC and ambient sound mode inside of Mater &amp; Dynamic&#39;s app. The on-board controls don&#39;t cycle between the two, but activate your last selection when you turn on either noise cancellation or ambient mode from the earbuds.</p><p>Battery life is also unchanged, and that&#39;s a good thing. The MW08 Sport offers 12 hours of battery life on the buds themselves with 30 additional hours in the charging case.&nbsp;</p><p>The new materials, additional ear tips and wireless charging bring the cost of the MW08 Sport up to $349. That&#39;s $50 more than the MW08. In addition to black and white colors that are similar to the MW08, navy and green options are available on the MW08 Sport.

The automaker has revealed during its most recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sets-delivery-record-by-building-and-shipping-200000-vehicles-in-q-2-213045738.html">earnings call</a> that it has pushed back the truck&#39;s arrival — yet again — to 2022, three years after its original launch target in 2019. Last year, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-semi-delayed-to-2021-222022916.html">announced</a> that it had to delay the vehicle&#39;s release to 2021 but didn&#39;t elaborate on what prompted the decision and if it was primary due to the pandemic. Now, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/26/tesla-delays-semi-truck-to-2022-cybertruck-back-burnered-for-model-y/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Tesla told shareholders that the Semi truck will be delayed due to the limited availability of battery cells and global supply chain challenges.</p><p>The whole statement reads:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;We believe we remain on track to build our first Model Y vehicles in Berlin and Austin in 2021. The pace of the respective production ramps will be influenced by the successful introduction of many new product and manufacturing technologies, ongoing supply-chain-related challenges and regional permitting.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>To better focus on these factories, and due to the limited availability of battery cells and global supply chain challenges, we have shifted the launch of the Semi truck program to 2022. We are also making progress on the industrialization of Cybertruck, which is currently planned for Austin production subsequent to Model Y.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>As <em>TechCrunch</em> notes, Tesla executive Jerome Guillen also left the company in June, just a few months after he started leading the trucking division. While the automaker didn&#39;t say whether his departure was in any way connected to the Semi&#39;s delay, Guillen used to lead Tesla&#39;s entire automotive business until he was made president of the Heavy Trucking unit in March.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-16-tesla-unveils-its-vision-of-the-future-of-trucking.html">announced</a> the Semi back in 2017, promising an electric big rig with a 500-mile range and technologies that include Enhanced Autopilot. It&#39;s been traveling all around the US and has apparently been capable of doing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-26-tesla-semi-truck-travels-cross-country-alone.html">cross-country trips</a> on its own without escorts since 2018, relying entirely on Tesla&#39;s existing Supercharger network. Elon Musk told staff in an internal email last year that the Semi is ready to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-semi-elon-musk-volume-production-153933911.html">enter mass production</a>, but the company&#39;s readiness doesn&#39;t mean anything without the truck&#39;s components.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-delays-semi-truck-2022-102502178.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aebfbae8-bdd4-4c79-883d-64c9a87cc12a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 10:25:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627381628</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T10:27:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/65bc1430-eeb8-11eb-9a3f-142d8b690772" width="1600" height="985" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/65bc1430-eeb8-11eb-9a3f-142d8b690772" width="1600" height="985" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's second-gen Echo Buds fall to Prime Day lows at Best Buy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2nd-gen-review-130018884.html">Echo Buds</a> have dropped to below $100 for the first time since Prime Day. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Best Buy" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/P0KePQ">Best Buy</a> is offering the wired charging model of the active noise-canceling earbuds for $80, down from their normal price of $120. If you prefer wireless charging, that particular model is back down to $100, a savings of $40. The Alexa-powered buds were already affordable, but the latest deal could sway those still on the fence. Especially considering that they were only released in April.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Amazon Echo Buds at Best Buy - $80" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/P0KePQ">Buy Amazon Echo Buds at Best Buy - $80</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Amazon Echo Buds (Wireless charging case) at Best Buy - $100" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/e4qyNX">Buy Amazon Echo Buds (Wireless charging case) at Best Buy - $100</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon improved its Echo Buds in all the right places with the second-gen model. With the right tweaks in the Alexa app, you can boost the audio, and take full advantage of the big bass, courtesy of that new 5.7mm high-performance driver. Amazon&#39;s digital assistant can also complete a range of tasks, from firing up music and podcasts to setting reminders and even fetching transit info for some US cities.</p><p>The overhaul also extends to the design. Both the earbuds and the charging case are 20 percent and 40 percent smaller, respectively. At this price, however, you can expect some cutbacks. One of the few areas that remains the same is the battery life, which offers five hours overall and two hours from just a 15-minute charge. The only other shortcoming is that the buds don&#39;t always block out noisy backgrounds on calls. But, with a little in-app customization, you can crank up your voice to help overcome that.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-deal-092943719.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3b7bcfc-812b-488e-bc6e-6c5433dce439</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 09:29:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627386161</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T11:43:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/61522d90-eebc-11eb-ae5d-8c005fc10918" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/61522d90-eebc-11eb-ae5d-8c005fc10918" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Echo Buds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Echo Buds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel will build chips for Qualcomm as part of its ambitious foundry plans]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier today, Intel unveiled <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html">detailed plans</a> for its future chip technology, describing how it plans to catch rivals TSMC and Samsung by 2025.

Samsung thinks it has an answer. The company will start taking pre-orders for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2021-tv-lineup-availability-150003304.html">long-teased</a> Odyssey Neo G9 display on July 29th for $2,500. Yes, you could buy a nice PC for less than the cost of this curved, 49-inch beast — although you might have good reasons to buy this over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-gaming-monitor-odyssey-g-7-28-4-k-144-hz-084535416.html">smaller, flatter</a> Odyssey screens.</p><p>As you might have guessed, the use of mini-LED delivers very high contrast ratios for an LCD monitor. Samsung claims a black level of just 0.0004. However, you&#39;re also getting extremely bright HDR thanks to a peak brightness of 2,000 nits that makes many TVs seem dim by comparison. Customizable lighting effects help add to the flash.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You should also see the same 5,120 x 1,440 resolution, 240Hz refresh rate and 1ms pixel response time from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-curved-gaming-monitors-us-prices-120014874.html">last year&#39;s Odyssey G9</a>, not to mention connectivity that includes two HDMI ports, DisplayPort and a pair of USB 3.0 connections.</p><p>You&#39;re clearly getting features that are hard to match. However, it&#39;s also apparent that Samsung is targeting a fairly narrow audience — The Neo G9 is meant for well-heeled gamers who want the most immersive non-VR experience possible. It could easily hit the sweet spot if you&#39;re in that demographic, but creative pros (and anyone on a budget) will probably want to look elsewhere.</p><div id="aa9477bf83e74f7498b24436f6701912"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKH1VUFCS-w?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-price-pre-order-020000540.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3fc3f15-25fd-4b55-ac78-3360ba194e75</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 02:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627309360</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T14:22:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/675f0c80-ee0d-11eb-af77-b9881b362301" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/675f0c80-ee0d-11eb-af77-b9881b362301" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 mini-LED curved gaming monitor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 mini-LED curved gaming monitor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung says an S Pen for foldables is coming at Unpacked]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ahead of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-date-august-11-foldable-smartwatch-no-note-000036462.html">upcoming Galaxy Unpacked event</a>, Samsung has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/unfold-next-era-of-smartphone-innovation/?utm_source=pr_media&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=unpck">published a blog post</a> by its president TM Roh that basically tells us what it plans to announce next month. In addition to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-wear-os-one-ui-watch-unpacked-2021-171520963.html">new Galaxy Watch powered by Wear OS</a>, the company will be launching the third generation of its Galaxy Z series and &quot;the first-ever S Pen designed specifically for foldable phones.&quot;</p><p>A stylus made for the pliable screens on foldables like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">the Galaxy Z Fold 2</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review.html">Z Flip</a> has been a widely requested feature, and would make the larger, opened up displays more useful. Of course, Samsung shared little else about this S Pen besides the fact that it&#39;s coming, so there are plenty of unknowns at the moment. How will it avoid damaging the softer, flexible screen? How precise will the stylus be? What size is its nib, what is its pressure sensitivity and will the foldables have onboard slots to house it? Will it have Bluetooth support for remote control actions? Clearly, these are things we&#39;ll have to wait till Unpacked on August 11th to learn about.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Roh also confirmed that Samsung will not be launching a new Note handset at the event, saying that &quot;Instead of unveiling a new Galaxy Note this time around, we will further broaden beloved Note features to more Samsung Galaxy devices.&quot;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0a2d3c70-ee3b-11eb-9e4f-0bf9b07a8131" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2" data-uuid="fb718e43-99e2-36ea-8e4d-5d2be2b3f156"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chris Velazco / Engadget</div></figure><p>As for the third generation of the Galaxy Z phones we&#39;ll be seeing at the event, Roh said the company has &quot;lined up even more partner apps that make the most of the versatile fold-out format.&quot; We can expect &quot;hands-free optimized video calling with Google Duo and watching videos in Flex mode on YouTube,&quot; as well as &quot;multitasking in Microsoft Teams.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, too, the next Galaxy Z Flip will have &quot;an even more refined style&quot; and &quot;more durable, stronger materials,&quot; while the upcoming Z Fold will &quot;combine the very best that smartphones and tablets offer and [deliver] completely new ways of working, connecting and creating.&quot;</p><p>The language is unsurprisingly vague, as Samsung can&#39;t give away all the details ahead of Unpacked. But it clearly also wants people to be excited — excited enough that they might be temped to reserve one of the new Z series devices already. If you choose to go through <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:the company&#39;s Reserve Now program" href="https://fave.co/3rrxI40">the company&#39;s Reserve Now program</a>, you can trade in up to two devices, including phones, tablets and wearables, towards a new Galaxy product. I&#39;d recommend till we learn more about what&#39;s coming on August 11th before doing that, and you can join us on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Engadget/videos">Engadget&#39;s YouTube channel </a>to watch Unpacked live. We&#39;ll be kicking things off with a pre-show at 9:40am ET and answer your questions in a post-show after Samsung wraps.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unpacked-august-2021-s-pen-foldables-galaxy-z-fold-3-z-flip-230006850.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">64f4bbb3-fb82-4f83-b6cb-741d0d947139</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 23:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627343517</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T23:52:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3b6df2e0-ee39-11eb-8bbf-035ccaf78d46" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3b6df2e0-ee39-11eb-8bbf-035ccaf78d46" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra S Pen.

Activision executive Joshua Taub allegedly told those in attendance he and CEO Bobby Kotick “have never seen this,” adding that “does not mean this behavior does not happen.” Taub then reportedly said, “we don’t publicize all of these claims, we work with the employee and the person who is accused and try to work on a resolution.” The company has a second meeting planned for tomorrow, according to <em>Uppercut</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>We’ve reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employee-open-letter-221223475.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">29634834-3811-47e6-851c-9affe866756f</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 22:12:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627334661</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T21:24:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eab98e40-eac8-11eb-aefb-94d36d9a725a" width="3792" height="2424" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eab98e40-eac8-11eb-aefb-94d36d9a725a" width="3792" height="2424" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/06/18: In this photo illustration, Activision Blizzard logo of a video game company is seen on a smartphone screen in front of Blizzard Entertainment logo.

Not only did Tesla build and ship 200,000 vehicles during the quarter, a 151 percent increase over last year, it also earned $1.1 billion in net income during the same period — a whopping tenfold increase year over year. Overall, revenue grew 98 percent from this time last year thanks in large part to Tesla&#39;s increased deliveries though the company did suffer from a &quot;Bitcoin-related impairment&quot; of $23 million during the past quarter.</p><p>Additionally, Tesla rolled out 85 MW worth of solar capability in Q2, a 215 percent increase from last year&#39;s 25 MW as well as added nearly 1,000 Supercharging stations to its ever expanding network. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also revealed more details about the company&#39;s plan to open its Supercharger network to other EV brands later this year.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We&#39;re currently thinking it&#39;s a real simple thing where, you just download the Tesla app, go to a supercharger and just indicate which stall you&#39;re in,&quot; he explained. &quot;And this should basically work with almost any manufacturers&#39; cars.&quot; Non-Tesla owners could see a few constraints in their use of the Supercharger network, Musk pointed out. &quot;if the charge rate is super slow, then somebody will be charged more.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Public sentiment towards EVs is at an inflection point and, at this point, I think almost everyone agrees that electric vehicles are the only way forward,&quot; Musk said during the call. He did note, however, that the ongoing global shortage of microchips remains an cantraining force on vehicle production. &quot;Regarding supply chain, while we&#39;re making cars at full speed, the global chip shortage situation remains quite serious... it does seem like it&#39;s getting better, but it&#39;s hard to predict.&quot; Musk said, warning that the issue will likely not be resolved before the end of this year.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of tech, Tesla&#39;s use of radar as part of the vehicle&#39;s Full Self Driving system will soon be coming to an end. &quot;After selling over a million vehicles equipped with radar, we have collected enough data to start removing it in some regions,&quot; the company wrote in <a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/ZBOUYO_TSLA_Q2_2021_Update_DJCVNJ.pdf?xseo=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22q2_2021.pdf%22">its shareholder deck</a>. &quot;The removal of radar, which is enabled by our collection of a vast dataset of corner cases, allows us to focus on vision and increase the pace of improvement.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Musk also commented on the recent launch of Tesla&#39;s FSD subscription which launched last month. &quot;We expected to build slowly and gather a lot of momentum over time,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously, we need to have the full self driving boat widely available for it really to take off... I think FSD subscription will be a significant factor probably next year.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The company is also getting closer to switching over to its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-battery-day-25k-ev-231307638.html">4680 battery cells</a>, having successfully validated the battery tech&#39;s &quot;performance and lifetime&quot; at its California-based fabrication facility. With that testing out of the way, Tesla is focusing on &quot;improving the 10 percent of manufacturing processes that currently bottleneck production output,&quot; though the company has not yet announced when the battery style  changeover will actually take place.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sets-delivery-record-by-building-and-shipping-200000-vehicles-in-q-2-213045738.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8772d6b-522e-4246-8a5b-df8e30c06d5d</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 21:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627367276</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T06:28:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cb62bc0-ee50-11eb-bfbd-2f482d134668" width="3716" height="2280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cb62bc0-ee50-11eb-bfbd-2f482d134668" width="3716" height="2280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VCG via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SHANGHAI, CHINA - JULY 11: Aerial view of new-energy vehicles sitting on a truck at Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory of Lingang New Area on July 11, 2021 in Shanghai, China.

It&#39;ll be coupled with PowerVia, a technology that can move power delivery to the rear of a chip wafer, which should make signal transmission more efficient.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e38a88f0-ee55-11eb-bfef-d1f03272e4c9" alt="Pat Gelsinger Intel" data-uuid="a54c36dd-738a-3977-9926-59a232802176"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>“Building on Intel’s unquestioned leadership in advanced packaging, we are accelerating our innovation  roadmap to ensure we are on a clear path to process performance leadership by 2025,” Intel&#39;s new CEO Pat  Gelsinger (above) said during the &quot;Intel Accelerated&quot; livestream today. “We are leveraging our unparalleled  pipeline of innovation to deliver technology advances from the transistor up to the system level. Until the periodic table is exhausted, we will be relentless in our pursuit of Moore’s Law and our path to innovate with the magic of silicon.”</p><p>Before it reaches the angstrom era of chips, though, the company also plans to release a processor with an &quot;Intel 3&quot; node in 2023. You can think of it as a super-powered version of its 7nm architecture, with around an 18 percent performance power watt improvement over Intel 4. It&#39;ll likely fill the timing gap between Rocket Lake chips in 2023 and the Intel 20A products in 2024. Intel is also daring to call its shot beyond 2024: it&#39;s also working on an &quot;Intel 18A&quot; node that&#39;ll further improve on its RibbonFET design.</p><p>For consumers, this roadmap means you can expect chips to get steadily faster and more efficient over the next five years. If anything, the announcements today show that Intel is trying to move beyond the 10nm and 7nm delays that have dogged it for ages.&nbsp;</p><p>As we&#39;ve previously argued, it&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-foundry-7nm-plan-analysis-141532580.html">ultimately a good thing for the tech industry </a>if Intel can finally regain its footing. Its $<a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">20 billion investment in two Arizona-based fabrication plants </a>was a clear sign that Gelsinger aimed to bring the company into new territory. But now that it&#39;s laid out a new timeline, there&#39;ll be even more pressure for Intel not to let things slip once again.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-chip-roadmap-7nm-20a-210033768.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">853499cd-dbc1-4d7b-8492-b0d6e16f83a5</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 21:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627334341</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T21:19:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/768adb80-ee53-11eb-9cfb-8894f971b119" width="4142" height="2762" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/768adb80-ee53-11eb-9cfb-8894f971b119" width="4142" height="2762" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Intel logo is displayed on computer screens at SIGGRAPH 2017 in Los Angeles, California, U.S. July 31, 2017.

Coming in at approximately 900MB, iOS 14.7.1 doesn&#39;t include new features but does address a bug that made its way into 14.7. The glitch broke Apple&#39;s Unlock with iPhone integration, preventing Touch ID-equipped phones from unlocking Apple Watch devices. So if you use an older iPhone with your Apple wearable, you&#39;ll want to download the update as soon as possible.</p><p>Apple says iOS 14.7.1 also addresses a security vulnerability that someone may have exploited.

They used new and archival datasets from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/hubble%20space%20telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a> to find the vapor, which forms when ice on the surface sublimates and turns from solid to gas.</p><p>A team led by Lorenz Roth of the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden examined data captured by Hubble&#39;s Cosmic Origins Spectrograph in 2018 and images the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph obtained between 1998 and 2010. Ultraviolet images captured by the STIS in 1998 showed “colorful ribbons of electrified gas called auroral bands,” according to <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/hubble-finds-first-evidence-of-water-vapor-at-jupiter-s-moon-ganymede">NASA</a> (which launched Hubble as a joint project with the European Space Agency).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Researchers previously believed that atomic oxygen may have caused discrepancies between UV images that were captured over time. However, using data from the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, Roth&#39;s team found that there was barely any atomic oxygen in the moon&#39;s atmosphere. As such, there had to be another reason for the discrepancies.</p><div id="1ed9bfa1f31044d69e845e3080db198d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SxvJ3a0bCbY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The temperature at Ganymede&#39;s equator may become warm enough for surface ice to release some water molecules. When they re-examined the relative distribution of the aurora in the UV images, Roth&#39;s team found that differences between them match up with where water would be expected in the moon&#39;s atmosphere.</p><p>Previous research indicated that Ganymede may hold more water than in all of our oceans. The moon&#39;s ocean is believed to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-13-nasa-proves-that-jupiters-biggest-moon-is-hiding-an-ocean.html">around 100 miles below the surface</a>, so the vapor isn&#39;t from there. Water on the surface is frozen due to the moon’s temperatures.</p><p>The finding arrived ahead of the ESA&#39;s wonderfully named upcoming mission, JUICE, or JUpiter ICy moons Explorer. The mission should launch in 2022 and arrive at Jupiter in 2029. It will then spend at least three years examining the planet and three of its largest moons. JUICE will pay special attention to Ganymede, both as a planetary body and possible habitat.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Our results can provide the JUICE instrument teams with valuable information that may be used to refine their observation plans to optimize the use of the spacecraft,&quot; Roth said <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/hubble-finds-first-evidence-of-water-vapor-at-jupiter-s-moon-ganymede">in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-07-nasa-extends-juno-mission.html">NASA&#39;s Juno mission</a> has also been studying Ganymede and Jupiter&#39;s environment (aka the Jovian system) since 2016. The agency says examining the Jovian system and understanding its history &quot;will provide us with a better understanding of how gas giant planets and their satellites form and evolve. In addition, new insights will hopefully be found on the habitability of Jupiter-like exoplanetary systems.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eb0d2578-2767-4e83-9149-4becb15a1b86</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 18:45:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627324872</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T18:41:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f030c350-ee3f-11eb-9fb3-bc5e6d081a26" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f030c350-ee3f-11eb-9fb3-bc5e6d081a26" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ianm35 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jupiter planet and satellite Ganymede in rotation in the outer space. 3d render]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jupiter planet and satellite Ganymede in rotation in the outer space. 3d render]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blue Origin offers NASA $2 billion in last-ditch attempt at lunar lander contract]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bezos-space-flight-blue-origin-quotes-204210894.html">returning from the edge of space</a>, Jeff Bezos has personally waded into Blue Origin&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-blue-origin-225547469.html">dispute with NASA</a> over its decision to award a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">$2.9 billion lunar lander contract</a> to Elon Musk&#39;s SpaceX. In an <a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news-archive/open-letter-to-administrator-nelson">open letter</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-bill-nelson-nasa-administrator-140348221.html">NASA Administrator Bill Nelson</a>, Bezos said his company is willing to waive up to $2 billion in payments from NASA in the current and next two federal fiscal years in return for a fixed-price lander contract. Bezos said Blue Origin is also willing to fund its own pathfinder mission to low-Earth orbit. &quot;This offer is not a deferral, but is an outright and permanent waiver of those payments,&quot; Bezos said in the letter. &quot;This offer provides time for government appropriation actions to catch up.&quot;</p><p>While Bezos spends a significant part of his letter talking about Blue Origin&#39;s commitment to &quot;advance America&#39;s future in space,&quot; his offer isn&#39;t altruistic. At the heart of it is the belief that NASA unfairly excluded his company from a lucrative and prestigious contract. When it comes to its most important projects, NASA has historically handed out agreements to multiple contractors to promote competition and ensure it can get a mission off the ground on time if one company falls behind schedule. In its latest procurement, NASA didn&#39;t do that, and Blue Origin filed a protest with the federal government shortly after that.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the time, a Blue Origin spokesperson told Engadget NASA &quot;executed a flawed acquisition for the Human Landing System program and moved the goalposts at the last minute.&quot; That&#39;s something Bezos reiterates in his letter. &quot;Instead of investing in two competing lunar landers as originally intended, the Agency chose to confer a multi-year, multi-billion-dollar head start to SpaceX,&quot; the former Amazon CEO said. &quot;That decision broke the mold of NASA&#39;s successful commercial space programs by putting an end to meaningful competition for years to come.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s hard to say how NASA will respond to the open letter. The Human Landing System project <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lunar-lander-gao-223702744.html">can&#39;t move forward</a> while the US Government Accountability Office reviews the protest from Blue Origin. Notably, this isn&#39;t the first time a Bezos-affiliated company has got itself into a contract dispute with the US government. In 2019, Amazon challenged the Department of Defense&#39;s decision to award Microsoft its $10 billion Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud contract. After a nearly two-year-long legal battle, the Pentagon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/department-of-defense-cancels-jedi-contract-172009337.html">canceled that project</a> at the start of July in favor of a new multi-vendor project that will hand out work to both Amazon and Microsoft.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-nasa-open-letter-181522642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">452460d2-eec5-4e6c-a8e3-7760c735c573</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 18:15:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627323326</ingested><modified>2021-07-26T18:15:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/200352f0-e66b-11eb-9c7f-9e1364ce59d9" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/200352f0-e66b-11eb-9c7f-9e1364ce59d9" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Clodagh Kilcoyne / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Founder, Chairman, CEO and President of Amazon Jeff Bezos unveils his space company Blue Origin's space exploration lunar lander rocket called Blue Moon during an unveiling event in Washington, U.S., May 9, 2019.

Right off the bat, we’re treated to a look at the new version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-apex-legends-season-3-worlds-edge-map.html">World’s Edge</a>. Respawn has tweaked the battleground to add a molten lava fissure that runs through the center of the map.</p><div id="5aa4bf8345eb4aad89e8c6ff308c4392"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bOD88NwyShM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The studio <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/emergence-worlds-edge-map-update">says</a> it did this in part to make combat encounters that take part in and around the Sorting Facility, one of the main points of interest in World’s Edge, more dynamic, with a greater emphasis on close-quarters action. Another major element of the redesign is the addition of gondolas at two of the new points of interest. According to Respawn, the idea here was to replicate some of the “dynamic gameplay” that trains offered in the original version of the map.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="36a2ba66c5794b4f82d2d89ff4c31ae5"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uQBKoZIYNrs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Outside of the redesigned World’s Edge, we also get to see the game’s new Rampage LMG in action, which will allow players to knock down doors from a distance. Towards the end of the clip, Seer, <em>Apex’s</em> latest playable character, makes his entrance. His kit allows you to narrow in on your opponents by tracking their heartbeats while aiming down the sights of your weapon. If you find an enemy, you can send a swarm of microdrones to hunt them down. Players can avoid detection by Seer by moving slowly.

As robots increasingly move out of labs, off of factory floors and into our everyday lives, a similar garment revolution could soon be upon us once again, according to a new research study out of New York’s Cornell University.</p><p>“We believe that robot clothes present an underutilized opportunity for the field of designing interactive systems,” the team argues in <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3461778.3462045"><em><ins>What Robots Need From Clothing</ins></em></a>, which was submitted to the In Designing Interactive Systems Conference 2021. “Clothes can help robots become better robots — by helping them be useful in a new, wider array of contexts, or better adapt and function in the contexts they are already in.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“I started by looking at how different materials would move on robots and thinking about the readability of that motion — like, what is the robot&#39;s intention based on the way materials move on the robot,” Natalie Friedman, a PhD student at Cornell Tech and lead author on the paper, explained to Engadget. “From there, I started thinking about all the different social functions that clothes have for people and how that could influence how the robot is viewed.”</p><p>While tomorrow’s robots may wear white button down dress shirts and black bow ties while serving hors d&#39;oeuvres to party guests or wear candy stripes while working as nurses, it’s not simply a matter of tossing human clothing onto a robotic chassis. “What robot clothes <em>are</em> is integrally tied to what robots <em>need</em> from clothing. Robot clothing should analogously fulfill needs robots have, rather than just being human clothes on a robot,” the researchers wrote.</p><p>Robo-clothes could take any number of forms, depending on their wearer’s specific function. Robotic firefighters, such as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1y_qA5o5ZM"><ins>Thermite from Howe and Howe</ins></a>, might theoretically be issued heat-resistant overcoats akin to what humans wear but embedded with thermochromic ink to provide the robot’s operator an easy visual reference to the area’s ambient temperature or indicate that the robot is in danger of overheating. Conversely, search-and-rescue bots could wear waterproof garments when conducting oceanic operations and then strap on extra-grippy boots when searching for lost hikers in mountainous terrain or survivors of a building collapse.</p><p>&quot;I think this work is important to helping engineers and technologists understand the functional importance of aesthetics and signaling in design,” Cornell Tech professor and co-author Wendy Ju, said in a recent blog. “It&#39;s not ‘just fashion’ - what the robot wears helps people understand how to interact with it in ways that are critical to safety and task execution.&quot;</p><p>Overall, the use of swappable attire could lead to more generalized robot designs as the specific capabilities the clothing provides don&#39;t have to be baked into the robot’s construction. “It is more difficult to build a new robot than to build new clothes,” Friedman said. “I think that clothes are going to influence robot design and robot designs are going to influence clothes. Maybe it&#39;ll start in one direction — clothes made to fit robots — but, in the future, I think that robots might be built to better fit in clothes.” She notes that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pepper-robot-softbank-robotics-face-mask-ai-152744854.html"><ins>Pepper</ins></a>, though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/softbank-stopped-production-pepper-robots-032616568.html"><ins>recently discontinued by SoftBank</ins></a>, offers an online merch store with a wide variety of costumes and outfits for the robot to wear including outfits designating cultural, national, professional and religious affiliations.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4a1b1d30-ec28-11eb-9ff9-2f375fb06125" style="height:3337;width:5000;" alt="Pepper human-shaped robot while celebrating the Buddhist funeral rites to the Tokyo Int&#39;l Funeral &amp; Cemetery Show in Tokyo August 23, 2017.

For example, clothing could help protect a robot’s sense of shame — or rather that of its user.</p><p>“The need for wire modesty — to cover up nudity — stems from anthropomorphic priggishness, since robots do not get embarrassed about wires poking out of them,” the researchers wrote. “However, both humanoid and non-humanoid robots have pragmatic reasons to maintain a clean and covered aesthetic, because exposed wires present a real risk to function. Any wire that is pulled out or cut will remove power or signal to a subsystem, and that can be risky to the robot and any people or objects in the environment.”</p><p>“I definitely see a future where [when robots] aren&#39;t wearing clothes, it might look a little funny,” Friedman added. “I mean we are just mapping our ideas onto robots, right? Robots don’t have  consciousness, so they don&#39;t feel shame.”</p><p>However, putting clothes on robots could also prove problematic especially if the apparel style has been culturally appropriated. You can bet your bottom dollar that the first cannabis dispensary to dress an automated budtender in rastafarian garb is going to make headlines — and not the kind that are good for business — same as if you outfitted a Roomba with a Native American headdress. “Hawaiian shirts, for example, used to be a marker of ‘casual Friday’ office attire, but more recently are affiliated with the extremist ‘Boogaloo Boys,’” the researchers wrote.</p><p>Despite the potential drawbacks to putting pants on robots, doing so could help make the entire field of research more attractive to a new generation of roboticists. “I like to think about girls in robotics,” Friedman said. “When they&#39;re young, I think robotics seems like a really intimidating thing but I see clothes as kind of a way to welcome, you know, the stereotypically feminine... skills that women have. I see clothes as a way to welcome girls into [robotics].”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/why-every-robot-needs-a-spiffy-hat-160039522.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b4b9b14c-1f22-4967-9f84-cbdd18ac105b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jul 2021 16:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627096321</ingested><modified>2021-07-24T03:12:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Clothes & Apparel]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a1032670-ec27-11eb-a9b7-23de8de98226" width="5067" height="3378" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/762e5640-ec27-11eb-b9bf-81cc03870e98" width="5390" height="3158" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Besjunior via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Renovation interior improvement concept.
