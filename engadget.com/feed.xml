The streaming giant used its TUDUM event to tease a further expansion of its adapted fantasy series. There will be a third season of <em>The Witcher</em>, to no one&#39;s surprise, but Netflix also revealed plans for a second <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nightmare-of-the-wolf-trailer-voice-cast-172150913.html">anime movie</a> and, believe it or not, a &quot;kids and family&quot; series — a bit odd for fantasy world loaded with sex, violence and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se5pnYyYs_k">colorful language</a>.</p><p>The company didn&#39;t provide release dates for any of the new projects.

The expansion would capitalize on that fandom and make it accessible to a much wider audience. It&#39;s just a question of whether or not viewers are willing to follow along, especially when iconic characters like Geralt and Yennefer might not be involved.</p><div id="a79dad9f788b444e94fc2efb2cfa3bb5"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Toss a coin to our growing Witcher universe!

We spent time with all of the company’s new products and reported back on their successes and missteps. First, Cherlynn Low tested out all four of the new iPhone 13 models to see which are worth your money this year. Valentina Palladino spent time carrying around the redesigned iPad mini, which does everything a small tablet should. Also, Devindra Hardawar found one more reason to recommend the Dell XPS 15, and Mat Smith took some average selfie’s with the ZTE Axon 30’s &quot;invisible&quot; front-facing camera.</p><h2>The iPhone 13 and 13 mini are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">made for shutterbugs</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcc02040-1a9d-11ec-b679-b593aac40b57" style="height:1013;width:1800;" alt="An iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 next to each other with their screens facing the camera." data-uuid="0d3b3232-2d48-35ee-9cfd-deb1d2471b09"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>On paper, Cherlynn Low says there’s not much to get excited about when it comes to the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:iPhone 13 and 13 Mini" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/NKbx1P">iPhone 13 and 13 mini</a>. The incremental upgrades like the bigger batteries, better displays and faster chips all feel like standard, annual improvements. The key features of the new handsets are the enhancements made to the cameras. The rear sensors have been improved, the ultra wide lens lets in more light and the A15 chip has a faster image signal processor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Cherlynn particularly liked the addition of Photographic Styles, which allows the user to choose a profile of contrast levels and color temperature for photos. And she said Cinematic Mode, which blurs out the background behind a subject, was the most intriguing of the new video features. But at its default intensity, the blurriness looked strange and artificial — and Cinematic Mode only works at 1080p/30fps, regardless of the quality you’ve set your camera to record.</p><p>Other aspects of the handsets were largely similar to previous models: the speakers are still good enough for video watching, and both phones easily handled switching between multiple apps, uploading photos and other tasks. However, Cherlynn was quick to point out that the phones still feature 60Hz screens, which made them feel laggy in comparison to handsets that have speedier displays. Overall she said that, as expected, they’re excellent (if a bit boring) phones with little to complain about.</p><h2>The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">impress with smooth screens</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a6f68610-1d61-11ec-bbfb-9fa94e0433d1" alt="Apple iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max" data-uuid="bff86cfe-94c9-34ed-8436-cb0ae0ccc945"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low says make no mistake about it: The one thing that really makes the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/NKbx1P">iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro</a> Max stand out is the new ProMotion display. With faster screens that can adjust their refresh rates depending on the task, the handsets are finally able to take advantage of their big OLED displays, whether you’re watching video or simply scrolling social media. The two new models are also 25 percent brighter for better outdoor viewing and, thanks to the 5-core GPU on the Pro, able to handle graphics-intensive tasks more quickly.</p><p>Cherlynn said that the A15 Bionic chip combined with the faster refresh rate made everything from YouTube and music streaming to <em>Catan </em>gaming and chatting with friends seem much more responsive. The two new Pro models also have an additional telephoto camera and a new macro photography mode, but all of that power comes with extra weight. The 6.1-inch 13 Pro is 7.19 ounces and the 6.7-inch 13 Pro Max clocks in at 8.46 ounces; Cherlynn said the bigger handset was uncomfortable to use one-handed for more than a few minutes. If that isn’t a dealbreaker, then she says either of the phones would make a worthy upgrade for iOS users.</p><h2>The iPad mini gets a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-mini-6th-generation-2021-review-130009170.html">much needed refresh</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dc444e60-1d61-11ec-b7fb-4084947eaed0" alt="Apple iPad Mini 2021" data-uuid="5b49165c-2c3f-35af-add9-03b2999ba811"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p>While the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iPad Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3lVJpxj">iPad mini</a> has a dedicated fan base, it hasn’t changed much since its debut nine years ago. But the 2021 release of the tiny tablet features enough upgrades to make it feel like a smaller iPad Air. Valentina Palladino says that the new “all-screen” design, flat edges, TouchID-capable top button, second-gen Apple Pencil support and USB-C charging all provide a much needed refresh for the tablet. The bezels helped her keep a comfortable grip on the device while reading and making FaceTime calls, and the lightweight 100-percent recycled aluminum body made it easy to tote around.</p><p>Valentina also liked that the new design allowed the second-generation Apple Pencil to magnetically stick to the right edge of the tablet. She reports that the mini makes a capable digital notebook thanks in part to the Pencil and the Quick Notes feature in iPadOS 15. Additionally, she said the A15 Bionic chip and the larger screen make it easy to use the device in place of an iPhone for a wide variety of tasks including video streaming and light gaming. However, the new mini only comes in 64GB and 256GB models — with a $150 price difference between them — and those are notable differences in capacity and cost. Valentina says the significant update will be great for small-tablet lovers, but she’s not sure if the iPad mini will win over others in the market for a standard-sized iPad.</p><h2>Dell’s XPS 15 is an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-15-oled-review-practically-perfect-15-inch-screen-laptop-120033751.html">even better laptop with an OLED screen</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1df48f50-1d62-11ec-bb3f-c5d820f98da3" alt="Dell XPS 15 OLED" data-uuid="aa72697f-132a-3c33-a862-3e81dd5f4aa3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar was already a fan of Dell’s excellent <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 15 laptop" href="https://bit.ly/3lOELBj">XPS 15 laptop</a>, but he says the addition of an OLED screen makes the whole package even better. The star of the show, the 15.6-inch display, has some of the thinnest bezels on the market and uses a 3.5K OLED touchscreen that supports Dolby Vision HDR (of course, this panel costs extra, and there are two LCD options to choose from, too). While watching the new <em>Matrix</em> trailer, it displayed true blacks, brilliant elements like explosions and juggled scenes with bright and dark aspects.</p><p>Devindra said he’d never had as much fun scrolling through websites due to the incredibly crisp text. The only additional improvement he could think of was a faster refresh rate, however, he had no complaints about the performance from the eight-core Intel i7 CPU or the 45-watt version of NVIDIA’s RTX 3050 Ti GPU, which transcoded a one-minute 4K video file into 1080p in 35 seconds. Devindra says you can expect it to tackle most intense workloads with ease, and although it’s not a gaming machine, it’s capable of reaching 70fps in <em>Overwatch</em> at the highest graphic settings.</p><h2>The ZTE Axon 30 smartphone <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zte-axon-30-review-153209819.html">offers an invisible selfie camera</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/831cb560-1d62-11ec-9d23-0ef08dd343be" alt="ZTE Axon 30" data-uuid="6bc9263f-1f81-333b-85c3-eff7cd39b645"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget, Mat Smith</div></figure><p>A sequel to the Axon 20, <a href="https://ztedevices.com/en-gl/axon-30/">ZTE’s Axon 30</a> touts an improved 16-megapixel, under-display camera (UDC) with a dedicated chip that keeps the area consistent with the rest of the screen. In practice, Mat Smith was pleased to report that the UDC is nearly invisible but he was less impressed with the resulting photographs. His selfies had fuzzy details and suffered from lens flares and washout due to strong backlighting. Mat got much better images when shooting with the four-camera array on the back, which includes a 64-megapixel Sony sensor.</p><p>However, the Axon 30 has more to offer for its $500 price tag: The smartphone also features a 6.92-inch AMOLED screen with 2,460 x 1,080 resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate. And it’s powered by a Snapdragon 870 processor, which handled everything Mat threw at it from Stadia gaming to video streaming. It also has a stand-out battery that lasted two days of typical use with the 120Hz refresh rate off, and the handset can recharge to 100 percent in under an hour. Mat liked the new MyOS 11 skin, which closely mimics the stock Google experience, save for a few shortcuts and widgets. But the smartphone lacks wireless charging and certified resistance against dust and water, and Mat says the 5G support isn’t great in the U.S. as it will only work on T-Mobile’s midband 5G network.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-apple-iphone-13-160028878.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">56fd36f5-b9cc-4b8e-8a64-0798a6d364db</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 16:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632510725</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T19:12:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2487e970-1a9c-11ec-9fdd-7a2e61c7e295" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2487e970-1a9c-11ec-9fdd-7a2e61c7e295" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A green iPhone 12 and pink iPhone 13 with their backs facing the camera.

Unlike gold, which derives its value from both its myriad uses in fashion and industry as well as the difficulty involved in extracting it from the Earth, acquiring new Bitcoin is as simple as digitally mining more of the stuff. In his latest book, <a href="https://www.futureofmoneybook.com/the-book/"><em>The Future of Money</em></a>, Senior Professor of Trade Policy at Cornell University, Eswar S Prasad deftly examines how we collectively assign value to these digital constructs and what that means for the economics of tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0e55b500-17ff-11ec-995d-f1e6a9a0b225" alt="The Future of Money dust cover" data-uuid="9cfaceeb-7934-33c4-b8cd-02785e59c81c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Harvard University Press</div></figure><p>Copyright © 2021 by the President and Fellows of Harvard College.

High and rising real estate valuations seemed to be based on the notion that all it took to make money from a house purchased at inflated prices was to find just one buyer—an even greater fool than oneself—willing to pay an even higher price.</p><p>Carney’s speech came on the heels of another by Agustín Carstens, head of the Bank for International Settlements; he described Bitcoin as “a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster.” Skeptics, including central bankers and academics, correctly note Bitcoin’s extremely volatile prices and the periodic price collapses it has experienced. Indeed, from an economist’s perspective, there is no logical reason Bitcoin should be priced beyond its value in providing an anonymous payment mechanism, let alone the sort of value it commands. Yet, even as it has shed all pretense of being an effective medium of exchange, Bitcoin has maintained the faith of its adherents. It seems not just to persevere but has become an increasingly prized store of value—or perhaps more accurately, an attractive speculative asset (at least as this book is being written—this could all change in a moment). What accounts for this?</p><p>To address this question, we must first consider what gives a financial asset, tangible or not, economic value. For one thing, an asset represents a claim on future goods and services. Owning a share of stock or debt issued by a firm is a claim on the firm’s future earnings, which in turn is based on its ability to create real products or services that have monetary value. The same is true for real estate, which yields real services to homeowners or renters that can be monetized. Owning a government bond is in principle a claim on future government revenues, which could come from taxes or other sources.</p><p>Gold is dif­ferent. It has an intrinsic value based on its industrial use, and it is also used in jewelry (and tooth fillings). But its market value seems far greater than its intrinsic value based on these uses. It appears that gold derives its value mainly from scarcity rather than its usefulness or any claim it offers of a future flow of goods and services. Scarcity by itself is clearly not enough; there has to be enough demand for an asset as well. Such demand could hang on a thread as slender as a collective belief in the market value of the asset—if you think there are other people who value gold as much as you do and enough people feel the same way, gold has value.</p><p>So is Bitcoin just a digital version of gold, with its value determined mainly by its scarcity? The limit of twenty-one million bitcoins is hardcoded into the algorithm, making it scarce by construction. But there still needs to be demand for it, as even Bitcoin cannot escape the basic laws of market economics, especially the determination of prices based on supply and demand. Such demand could of course be purely speculative in nature, as seems to be the case now that Bitcoin is not working well as a medium of exchange.</p><p>It does take copious amounts of computing power and electricity to mine Bitcoin, and unfortunately, computers and electricity have to be paid for in real money—which is still represented by fiat currencies. It has been argued that Bitcoin’s baseline price is determined by this mining cost. One research company estimated the electricity cost of mining one bitcoin in the United States to be about $4,800 in 2018. Another company estimated the overall break-even cost of mining a bitcoin in 2018 at $8,000, suggesting that this constituted a floor for its price. But this is hardly reasonable logic. Just because something takes a lot of resources to produce is not enough to create demand for it and, therefore, to justify its price.</p><p>Bitcoin devotees, needless to say, have an answer for this; given the technologically inclined nature of this community, it had to be a quantitative model. The model, if it can be called that, uses the ratio of the existing stock relative to the flow of new units as an anchor for the price.</p><p>Consider gold. The total stock of gold that exists in the world (above ground) is estimated at about 185,000 metric tons. Roughly 3,000 tons of gold are mined each year, which amounts to about 1.6 percent of the existing stock. Thus, the stock-to-flow ratio is about sixty. It would take that many years for annual gold production, assuming it continues at the average rate, to reproduce the existing stock. For silver, this ratio is about twenty-two. The logic of this pricing model appears to be that even doubling the annual rate of gold or silver production would leave their stock-to-flow ratios high, in which case they would remain viable stores of value with high prices. The physical constraints on supply—ramping up mining operations would take a long time—mean there is little risk of a surge in supply knocking down prices of the existing stock. By contrast, for other less precious commodities, including metals such as copper and platinum, the existing stock is equal to or lower than annual production. Thus, as soon as the price begins rising, production can be ramped up, preventing large price hikes. With these commodities, prices are more closely tied to values based on industrial and other practical uses.</p><p>In 2017 the stock of Bitcoin that had been mined was estimated to be around twenty-five times larger than that of the new coins produced in that year. This is high but still less than half of the stock-to-flow ratio for gold. Around 2022, Bitcoin’s stock-to-flow ratio is expected to overtake that for gold. Thus, if one accepts this logic, the price of Bitcoin must eventually rise.</p><p>This valuation is built entirely on a fragile foundation of faith. As one influential Bitcoin blogger puts it: “Bitcoin is the first scarce digital object the world has ever seen. . . . Surely this digital scarcity has value.” This blogger makes profuse allusions, which are echoed on most websites and chat boards frequented by Bitcoin adherents, to how Bitcoin and gold are analogous: “It is [the] consistently low rate of supply of gold that is the fundamental reason it has maintained its monetary role throughout human history. The high stock-to-flow ratio of gold makes it the commodity with the lowest price elasticity of supply.” Fiat money and other cryptocurrencies that have no supply cap, no Proof of Work consensus protocol, and no need of large amounts of computing power to keep operating are seen as less likely to retain value because their supplies are not constrained and can be influenced by the government or small groups of individuals or stakeholders.</p><p>Clearly, logic and reason are not important underpinnings of Bitcoin valuations. And it is hard to argue, as I have learned, with a twenty-fiveyear-old who bought his first bitcoin at $400, then kept buying, and now views every dip in Bitcoin prices as a buying opportunity to add to his stash. But, as an economist, one does worry for that young man (whom I sat next to at a conference in January 2019 and with whom I ended up having a long and heated discussion) and others who have bet their life savings on Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Then again, with the price of Bitcoin where it is in April 2021, perhaps my time would have been better spent in the past few years acquiring some bitcoin rather than laboring on this book.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-future-of-money-eswar-prasad-harvard-university-press-153024975.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0988ca7c-19f0-4ac9-a579-b834e6db9f98</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 15:30:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632510018</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T19:00:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5ea7d740-17ff-11ec-9ffd-ff33ac942d83" width="3500" height="2376" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5ea7d740-17ff-11ec-9ffd-ff33ac942d83" width="3500" height="2376" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pawel Kopczynski / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A mock Bitcoin is displayed on a table in an illustration picture taken in Berlin January 7, 2014.

According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/apple-told-a-showbiz-union-it-had-less-than-20-million-tv-subscribers.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>, the tech giant told the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees that TV+ has fewer than 20 million subscribers in the US and Canada. A few months ago, Statista <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1136261/number-of-apple-tv-plus-subscribers-us/">published</a> an estimate that puts the service&#39;s subscriber number to 40 million by the end of 2020 in the US alone.&nbsp;</p><p>The firm admitted, however, that the estimate does not &quot;necessarily reveal how many paying subscribers use the service.&quot; <em>CNBC</em> didn&#39;t say whether the 20 million subscribers the company declared were paying customers either. It also didn&#39;t mention how many of those got their subscriptions for free: Apple used to give away year-long subscriptions to customers who purchase new iPhones, iPads and Macs, but it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-free-trial-reduced-july-1-105546762.html">shortened</a> the offer to three months back in June.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the report, having less than 20 million subscribers allowed Apple to pay production crew lower rates than bigger streamers. Under the current contract seen by <em>CNBC</em>, streaming services can pay their employees lower rates if they report less than 20 million subscribers to the IATSE every July 1st, because streaming profitability is &quot;presently uncertain.&quot; The union is negotiating for a better contract, though, since current rules don&#39;t make an exception for tech giants like Apple. It also argues that streaming can no longer be considered &quot;new media.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>An Apple rep told <em>CNBC</em> that the company pays in line with leading streaming services but refused to comment on the claimed subscriber number. 20 million is but a fraction of the number of subscribers the biggest streaming services have: Netflix claimed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2021-201731732.html">208 million subscribers</a> in April, while Disney+ claimed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-192533901.html">over 100 million</a> back in March.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-showbiz-union-tv-service-20-million-subscribers-124041017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ebea5728-f04d-49fc-b503-b74721c4a2d4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 12:40:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632573644</ingested><modified>2021-09-25T12:40:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3fdcc160-1dde-11ec-bd9e-5b815a90d32b" width="1960" height="1104" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3fdcc160-1dde-11ec-bd9e-5b815a90d32b" width="1960" height="1104" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter shows off new concepts for filtering and limiting replies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter has been trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-launches-reply-limits-to-all-users-173007909.html">limit the toxic replies</a> you can get on its website by giving you tools that allow you to be more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-anti-bullying-prompts-expansion-173049219.html">proactive</a> in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tests-safety-mode-164638754.html">preventing</a> them from going through.

Of course, the final iterations of the tools might look vastly different from these previews if they do get released.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked if toggling on the reply filter would filter out all tweets from an account or just the tweet the website has deemed potentially offensive, Barcante didn&#39;t have an answer yet. She said what she showed was just an &quot;early concept that requires testing and iteration&quot; and that Twitter will provide more details if it decides to launch the tools.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitterconcepts-filtering-limiting-replies-054221017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c913d7ed-a2e8-4f1c-93e1-efd3d9ac12e2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 05:42:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632548568</ingested><modified>2021-09-25T05:42:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/13f87240-1db8-11ec-b9f7-7984d1243909" width="1600" height="1019" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/13f87240-1db8-11ec-b9f7-7984d1243909" width="1600" height="1019" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 Pro's 120Hz display limits some third-party app animations to 60Hz (updated)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With this year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max</a>, Apple finally brought its ProMotion display technology from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-12-apple-ipad-pro-10-5-review.html">iPad Pro</a> over to some of its phones.

Thoughtful design and features helped it differentiate itself and earn a passionate fanbase in a crowded market that was dominated by heavyweights like GCal.</p><p>But then Microsoft shut down the app and fans were left to look elsewhere, with almost no alternative coming in to fill the void. But the good news is something similar could be on the way. Yahoo (Engadget’s parent company) is working on a standalone calendar app called <a href="https://day.co/"><ins>Day</ins></a>.

What’s more, the company has reportedly granted Le Van’s team the freedom to develop the software independent of other Yahoo properties. In its current iteration, the app apparently doesn’t feature any Yahoo branding or integrations. Moreover, the plan is to make it into something that can integrate with whatever email client and other tools people use.</p><p>Obviously, we’ll have to see what the final product looks like, but even if Day is only half as good as Sunrise it will make the calendar conversation more interesting.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/yahoo-day-calendar-app-sunrise-creator-213335107.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97fa8b98-4363-4a9f-a590-cbaf2257621e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 21:33:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632519219</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T21:33:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8b22c800-1d7e-11ec-bffe-7f6c5cc716cb" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8b22c800-1d7e-11ec-bffe-7f6c5cc716cb" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yahoo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Day]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Day]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter now lets you add topics to Spaces, but the options are limited]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is adding yet another feature to make Spaces more discoverable.

The viewing package is probably on the move and the league has reportedly picked its preferred new home for Sunday Ticket: Apple.</p><p>It doesn&#39;t seem likely that DirecTV, which has been one of the NFL&#39;s main TV partners for nearly three decades, will renew its deal. The NFL is looking for north of $2 billion per year for Sunday Ticket rights, according to <a href="https://theathletic.com/news/nfl-prefers-apple-as-new-sunday-ticket-provider-sources/TJgzheClMwpc"><em><ins>The Athletic</ins></em></a>, which is at least $500 million more than the satellite company is currently paying the league.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DirecTV has long been losing money on the package. It needs 5 million Sunday Ticket subscribers to cover the current fees, though <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/10/amazon-likely-front-runner-for-multi-year-nfl-sunday-ticket-deal-sources.html"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reported the figure has been closer to 2 million on average. Combined with a sense that the NFL is diluting Sunday Ticket&#39;s value by shifting more games to other days, that doesn&#39;t exactly make reupping the deal an attractive proposition for DirecTV and parent company AT&amp;T.</p><p>As such, potential suitors with deeper pockets appear to be stepping up. Apple, Disney/ESPN and Amazon, which will start <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-thursday-night-football-2022-season-184224274.html"><ins>streaming Thursday Night Football games</ins></a> on Prime Video next season, are among those who have reportedly shown interest.</p><p>It&#39;ll likely be several months before the Sunday Ticket bidding process is over, but Apple looks like the frontrunner. <em>The Athletic</em> reports that Apple is considering offering games on a more ad-hoc basis. It could let fans buy their own team&#39;s out-of-market games or even shell out for standalone games.</p><p>One factor in Amazon&#39;s favor is it has more experience than Apple when it comes to live sports.

Jeep will debut the long-awaited 2022 Grand Cherokee, including the nameplate’s first-ever 4xe plug-in hybrid model, on September 29th at 9AM ET, the automaker <a href="https://media.stellantisnorthamerica.com/newsrelease.do?id=23136&amp;mid=898">announced today</a>. Jeep had initially planned to debut the 2022 Grand Cherokee in August at the 2021 New York Auto Show, but that plan went out the window when the event was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-new-york-auto-show-canceled-190749186.html">canceled</a> due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>We got our first good look at the SUV when Jeep <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeep-4xe-2025-plan-200527710.html">shared its updated electrification</a> plans in July. Unsurprisingly, it looked a lot like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-jeep-grand-cherokee-l-050100377.html">Grand Cherokee L</a> but with a shorter wheelbase. The upcoming 4xe model is expected to feature the same gasoline-electric powertrain as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2021-jeep-wrangler-unlimited-sahara-4-xe-phev-first-drive-174554804.html">2021 Wrangler 4xe</a>. That SUV can output a combined 375 horsepower and 470 pound-feet of torque.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Its 4xe models are becoming increasingly important to Jeep. In July, the automaker said it expects electric vehicles to account for 70 percent of all of its sales by mid-decade. To that end, it plans to offer a “fully electric” 4xe model in every SUV category it sells by 2025.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jeep-2022-grand-cherokee-4xe-debut-september-29-173239673.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">079d3130-2b6d-4323-b669-6e6df5b56722</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 17:32:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632504764</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T17:32:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4b483540-e024-11eb-be26-92d3282c47e3" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4b483540-e024-11eb-be26-92d3282c47e3" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jeep]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Justice Department will reportedly let Huawei exec Meng Wanzhou return to China]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Department of Justice has reached an agreement with Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou that will let her return home to China, pending a judge&#39;s approval.

Meng remotely appeared at a federal court on Friday afternoon, with the Justice Department <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/huawei-executive-reaches-deal-us-170137848.html?fr=sycsrp_catchall">saying</a> in a filing it will submit a &quot;resolution&quot; to the charges against her.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Prosecutors claimed that Meng misled banks in 2013 about Huawei&#39;s connections to Iran.

Two Canadians were apprehended in China within days of Meng&#39;s arrest. The <em>WSJ </em>reports the deal with Meng could prompt China to release Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig.</p><p>Officials from the Trump administration are said to have offered Meng a similar deal last year, but she reportedly refused to admit to any wrongdoing. Biden admin officials reopened the talks in recent weeks, according to reports, and with Meng seemingly seeking a reunion with her family, she may have been more open to a compromise. A judge in Vancouver was expected to rule on Meng&#39;s possible extradition to the US later this year, following almost two years of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-cfo-extradition-allowed-in-canada-ruling-194024350.html">hearings</a>.</p><p>Huawei and its subsidiaries are still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-13-justice-department-huawei-charges.html">facing charges in the US</a>, including conspiracy to steal trade secrets and racketeering conspiracy. The company is not said to be part of Meng&#39;s deal and it will reportedly keep fighting the charges.</p><p>The US and Huawei have been at loggerheads for several years.

Signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday, <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/09/23/governor-newsom-signs-legislation-9-23-21/"><ins>SB 500</ins></a> represents the latest effort by the state to limit the sale of new internal combustion vehicles with an eye towards reducing greenhouse emissions. In 2020, Newsom signed an executive order that effectively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html"><ins>banned the sale of new gasoline and diesel-powered</ins></a> vehicles by 2035. That same year, the state’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-push-for-zeroemissions-heavy-trucks-032143253.html"><ins>Air Resources Board</ins></a> mandated that all new trucks sold in California emit zero emissions by 2045.</p><p>“We’re grateful for California’s leadership in ensuring this will be the industry standard,” said Prashanthi Raman, head of global government affairs at Cruise, in a statement to Engadget. “The AV industry is primed to lead the way in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in cities, and it’s why we’ve operated an all-electric, zero-emissions fleet from the start.” Cruise backed SB 500 through its involvement with the <a href="https://www.emissionzero.net/"><ins>Emission Zero Coalition</ins></a>, a group that also includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuro-california-dmv-deployment-permit-214528906.html"><ins>autonomous delivery startup Nuro</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Per the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenvehicles/fast-facts-transportation-greenhouse-gas-emissions"><ins>Environmental Protection Agency</ins></a>, the transportation sector has been the single largest source of greenhouse emissions in the US since 2019, with light-duty vehicles accounting for more than half of that output. However, autonomous cars currently represent only a tiny fraction of the nearly 15 million vehicles on California roads. Moreover, both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-cruise-california-passengers-fully-driverless-rides-161005084.html"><ins>Cruise</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-san-francisco-trusted-tester-170602490.html"><ins>Waymo</ins></a>, two of the most prominent companies testing fully autonomous taxi services in the state, utilize fleets made almost exclusively of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-gm-ev-only-assembly-plant-detroit.html"><ins>electric</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-19-google-waymo-chrysler-self-driving-minivan.html"><ins>hybrid</ins></a> vehicles. This latest move from California then is about preventing autonomous vehicles from becoming major polluters in the future, particularly if driverless taxi services become popular among commuters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-zero-emissions-autonomous-vehicles-2030-162009922.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80ae15a5-a503-4588-9e29-3cea1b936d72</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 16:20:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632500415</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T16:20:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pollution & Waste]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cdbedb0-1d52-11ec-bfe9-57240ffb77ec" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cdbedb0-1d52-11ec-bfe9-57240ffb77ec" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cruise]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cruise car in San Francisco]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cruise car in San Francisco]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MacBook Air M1 is $150 off, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week brought <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-2021-event-recap-185020522.html">new Surface devices</a> and a bunch of tech deals across the web.

Along with a second season of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tiger%20king"><em><ins>Tiger King</ins></em></a>, there&#39;s a documentary on the way that will dive into one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-08-quadrigacx-bitcoin-missing-millions.html"><ins>messiest Bitcoin tales to date</ins></a>.</p><p><em>Trust No One: The Hunt For The Crypto King </em><a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1441040701320351750"><ins>will debut</ins></a> in 2022. It centers around a group of cryptocurrency investors turned amateur detectives. They attempt to get to the bottom of the suspicious death of crypto exchange founder Gerald Cotten and figure out what actually happened to the $250 million they think he stole from them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Cotten was the founder of QuadrigaCX, said to be the biggest crypto exchange in Canada for a spell. He died in December 2018 of Crohn&#39;s disease complications. According to his widow, Jennifer Robertson, Cotten was the only one who knew the passwords to QuadrigaCX&#39;s offline crypto storage, meaning that digital currency that was worth around $200 million CAD in early 2019 was no longer accessible.</p><p>However, internet sleuths uncovered some eyebrow-raising details about the saga. For one thing, Cotten wrote a will a month before his death in which he left all of his assets to Robertson. There were also suggestions QuadrigaCX didn&#39;t have enough cash on hand to pay all of its creditors and even that Cotten <a href="https://www.coinspeaker.com/netflix-documentary-quadrigacx-ceo/">faked his death</a> and disappeared with the money. The company ceased operations in 2019 after it was declared bankrupt.</p><p>The FBI started investigating that year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-05-quadrigacx-bitcoin-fbi-ir.html"><ins>seeking information</ins></a> from those who lost money after Cotten&#39;s death and QuadrigaCX&#39;s collapse. It remains to be seen whether the documentary will include any concrete details about the resolution of the saga, but it should at least direct the spotlight toward one of the more curious crypto cases of recent years.</p><p>Also on the way to Netflix is <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1441040133193568270"><em><ins>The Tinder Swindler</ins></em></a>, a documentary about a conman who posed as a billionaire on the dating app and the women who tried to stop him.

That’s why the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html">iPhone 13 Pro’s most important new feature is its ProMotion</a> display.</p><p>But ProMotion is only included on the Pro and Pro Max models this year, making it one of the features that differentiate them from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13 and 13 mini</a>, not to mention <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">last year’s 12 Pro</a>. For an extra $200 to $300, the Pro series also offers an additional telephoto camera, a new macro photography mode, as well as more power and endurance. But are the iPhone 13 Pro’s new cameras and screens worth the extra money?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design</h2><p>Before we get into those features, though, there’s one thing you should consider: weight. At 204 grams (7.19 ounces), the 6.1-inch 13 Pro is heavier than both the 12 Pro and the iPhone 13. The 13 Pro Max, which has a 6.7-inch screen, outweighs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-review-cameras-battery-price-233156949.html">last year’s Pro Max</a> and Samsung&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-specs-price-cameras-snapdragon-888-160013665.html">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>. While I didn’t mind the regular Pro, it was uncomfortable to use Apple’s biggest flagship one-handed for more than a few minutes at a time.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cb811cb0-1cfe-11ec-b6f5-fb4009179dfb" alt="An iPhone 13 Pro Max in Sierra Blue" data-uuid="c3403808-ace5-3796-969a-43c6c5b1e123"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>In addition to being heavier than last year&#39;s models, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are a bit thicker, too. They also have larger rear camera modules and slightly smaller display notches. Otherwise, Apple hasn’t strayed far from the 12 Pro’s design. These phones have similar stainless steel enclosures with glass coverings, and are rated IP68 for water and dust resistance.</p><p>Even the colors available are familiar: The typical trio of graphite, gold and silver are now accompanied by Sierra Blue. Personally, I prefer this paler shade to the Pacific Blue offered on the last generation.</p><h2>Display and audio</h2><p>I realized something when I started testing the iPhone 13 series last week: Basically everything I do on a phone requires scrolling. That includes browsing social feeds, looking for the right component on a spec sheet, reading through old conversations, creeping on my Instagram viewers and reading articles, to give you a non-exhaustive list.</p><p><em>This </em>is why Apple’s new ProMotion screen on the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max is a big deal, and also why it’s kind of annoying that it took the company so long to adopt this technology in the first place. Google was already a little behind when it added 90Hz panels to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras.html">the Pixel 4</a>, after companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-22-asus-rog-phone-ii-gaming-hands-on.html">ASUS</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-14-oneplus-7-pro-review.html">OnePlus</a> had already introduced higher refresh rates. Nowadays, this tech isn&#39;t just for premium, top-tier Android devices either.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb452190-1cfe-11ec-af5f-6db0f202f959" alt="The iPhone 13 Pro, held face up in a person&#39;s hand, with the iOS 15 home screen in view." data-uuid="91300510-2b0c-3fae-8d53-3a2aa2e54722"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>This is hardly the first time Apple is late to adopt a new technology. But it is worth emphasizing that the faster screens on the iPhones make a real difference. Like many Android phones, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max adjust their refresh rates depending on what you’re doing. They can go as low as 10Hz when you’re looking at a static image, or up to 120Hz for scrolling and compatible games.</p><p>The benefits might not be obvious at first, but when you go back to a slower screen, you’ll quickly notice the jagged artifacts they produce.</p><p>Aside from ProMotion, the iPhone 13 Pro’s OLED displays are also 25 percent brighter than their predecessors, which is nice for outdoor reading. But without a side-by-side comparison, the difference is subtle at best.</p><p>Regardless, I enjoyed watching the visual perfection that is Doja Cat’s <em>Kiss Me More</em> music video on the iPhone 13 Pro’s True Tone display. The rosy, cotton-candy hues looked vibrant and her individual lashes were clear. The stereo speakers also did a respectable job of delivering crisp audio with adequate bass. Other things like voices and instrumental background music in videos and games all came through clearly as well.</p><section data-eng-breakout="75c76fee4e104d248d72c7e2a5593a63" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5b064ae0-1cff-11ec-b8fd-3e4f4674243c" alt="Close up of the gold iPhone 13 Pro&#39;s triple rear cameras"></section><h2>Cameras</h2><p>Apple says the iPhone 13 Pro’s rear cameras have received the “<a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-13-pro/">biggest upgrade ever</a>,” touting “next-level hardware that captures so much more detail.” The triple 12-megapixel setup includes a primary sensor with a large f/1.5 aperture, a 77mm telephoto lens and an ultra-wide option with a 120-degree field of view. Night mode is now supported on all three of the cameras, so you don’t have to compromise on wide-angle or close up shots in low light. There’s also a new macro photography feature thanks to the updated ultra-wide lens, along with software like Photographic Styles and Cinematic Mode.</p><p>Those two modes are also offered on the iPhone 13 and 13 mini, and you can read my review of those phones for more details. In short, Photographic Styles lets you easily customize and set a sort of default for the contrast levels and color temperature of your images. Meanwhile, Cinematic Mode is good at identifying faces and people in a scene and blurring out everything surrounding a subject, but it struggled when I tried to change the focal point. The system is also a little wonky at outlining individuals, and stray body parts like thumbs and ears can get eaten up in the artificial blur. I found that adjusting the intensity via the f-stop setting helped keep this problem at bay, but the trade-off was less of a DSLR-like look in the final video.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/80e5ba20-1cff-11ec-ae9b-9ac58c12e753" alt="Cinematic Mode on iPhone 13" data-uuid="9247c551-ec54-35e6-b562-06a220987ca4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>One feature the Pros have over the regular 13 is macro photography. With this generation, you can get as close as two centimeters away from your subject and not lose focus. Unfortunately, Apple doesn’t offer a way to manually enable a macro mode; the system automatically switches to the close-up camera when you get all up in something’s face.</p><p>The iPhone 13 Pro was generally accurate at detecting when I was trying to get a tight shot, but it kept changing back and forth between macro and regular views. Sometimes it would continually focus and refocus on the flowers behind the buds I was trying to shoot. The latter is a more understandable issue; every little hand tremor is magnified when a camera is zoomed that far in, making it hard to latch on to a subject. Not to mention something in motion, like a leaf in the wind. But that’s all the more reason to give users manual control.</p><p>Apple has said it will be releasing a software update soon that should prevent the camera from switching in and out of macro mode, which I of course can&#39;t vouch for yet.</p><p>When it worked as expected, macro mode delivered surprisingly great results. My shots of a closed flower bud and the vein system on a leaf’s surface were impressively detailed, showing individual hairs on the stem and petals. Close-ups of a fried fish clearly rendered the oil oozing out of the batter.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="b174b54d-4a79-4497-bc6d-0fd255c83e41"/><p>You need to make sure to let enough light shine on your subject, though, because my shots of a bee inside a flower were dark and splotchy. But that’s basically Photography 101; it’s not an issue specific to macro mode.</p><p>In general, the iPhone 13 Pro took sharp, colorful photos rivaling my sample shots from the Pixel 5 and Galaxy S21 Ultra. Apple’s default treatment renders pictures that are typically brighter and sometimes more saturated, but with Photographic Styles you can pick a look that you like and stick with it. I’m not a fan of the iPhone’s aggressive HDR effects compared to the Pixels’ more neutral landscapes, but frankly we’re at a point where Samsung, Google and Apple are generally on par in terms of sheer quality.</p><p>The iPhone 13 Pro’s upgraded sensors also really improved low light performance. I took photos of the moon peeking through some clouds in the middle of Manhattan skyscrapers with the S21 Ultra, Pixel 5 and iPhone 13 Pro, and they were all clean and sharp. They differed a bit in color temperature, but it’s not noticeable without a direct comparison. Google still retains an advantage with Night Sight, though; it produces photos that are significantly cleaner, brighter and richer in detail.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/af929460-1cff-11ec-b0fb-1ac4511b656e" alt="A medium shot of the notch housing the iPhone 13 Pro&#39;s front camera." data-uuid="076d969f-1629-3715-b4a0-cae28c0ce2a1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>As for the 13 Pro’s front camera, it’s pretty much the same as the iPhone 13’s, and that’s not a bad thing. You’ll still get Cinematic Mode and Photographic Styles via the 12-megapixel True Depth sensor, and though selfies were a little soft in low light, they were otherwise sharp.</p><p>Because these are Pro-series phones, Apple also threw in support for ProRes videos in addition to its ProRAW format for stills... or at least it will eventually. ProRes won’t be available until a future iOS 15 update arrives at an unspecified date, but it promises to preserve colors at high quality. And, thanks to the A15’s hardware acceleration plus video encoders and decoders, you’ll be able to record in the format at up to 4K resolution (1080p for the base 128GB model) and 30 frames per second.</p><h2>iOS 15</h2><p>Speaking of, the iPhone 13 series runs iOS 15 out of the box, and I was able to test most of the new features when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">I tested the beta version</a>. Focus modes, for example, let you set custom home pages and notification profiles based on your location or time of day. It’s one of my favorite new features on any smartphone platform in recent years because it allows people without a separate work device to switch off from work when they please.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c976ff60-1cff-11ec-9ffb-1dbc9d9986b4" alt="An iPhone 13 Pro standing on a fabric surface with its screen facing the camera." data-uuid="4d04c0c5-3991-305f-9505-4be457d9e531"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Since most of iOS 15’s new features will be coming to older iPhones, though, they’re unlikely to sway your decision on whether to upgrade. We’ll have a more in-depth review of iOS 15, but suffice to say I appreciate the level of control it offers. I’m especially looking forward to testing out SharePlay, which hasn&#39;t rolled out yet, but will let you watch shows with or stream your phone screen to friends over FaceTime.</p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>The main difference between the iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro’s processors is that the latter uses a beefier 5-core GPU. This means that graphics-intensive tasks like gaming or video editing should be executed more quickly. I made a trailer in iMovie and while I had to wait 51 seconds for it to finish exporting on the iPhone 13, it took a mere 15 seconds on the Pro.</p><p>The iPhone 13 Pro’s A15 Bionic chip is similarly powerful in less-intensive tasks. I played rounds of <em>Catan</em>, watched various YouTube videos, chatted with friends, played music and snapped photos in rapid succession — all without any delay. And I know I’ve already said this a lot, but I have to stress again that the faster screens here just make most tasks feel more responsive.</p><p>In the week or so that I’ve had the iPhone 13 Pros, I’ve only needed to charge them twice. Granted, I spent most of the first few days focusing on the iPhone 13 and 13 mini, using the Pros predominantly when I was doing intensive camera testing. But when I switched over to the more-premium devices, the iPhone 13 Pro lasted almost a full two days before needing a charge. Battery levels dipped more quickly when I was playing games and exporting videos, but not so much that I had to worry about running out of juice.</p><p>Considering its higher refresh rate, that’s an impressive runtime. I’m still running battery tests across the iPhone 13 lineup, and will update this review with more empirical results as soon as that’s done. For now, though, it’s clear that despite the ProMotion displays, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max can last longer than a day.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f1922dd0-1cff-11ec-bdde-90058ea15718" alt="A blue iPhone 13 Pro Mac and a gold iPhone 13 Pro next to each other on a table with their rear cameras facing us." data-uuid="b123ee1c-4c03-3fed-800e-fe42028b6791"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>With faster screens, superb performance and long-lasting batteries, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max are excellent phones. If you’re on a device older than a 12 Pro, you should consider upgrading just<em> for</em> the new ProMotion displays. Though the cameras also got a noteworthy improvement, I’m not sure they’re going to be the biggest draw. It’s honestly hard to spot the difference in quality between photos taken by Apple’s recent flagships.</p><p>Features like Cinematic Mode, Photographic Styles and macro cameras are nice to have, but won’t define your iPhone 13 Pro experience. And though Apple was playing catch up to Android flagships by finally introducing 120Hz screens to its phones, there are now fewer things that Samsung and Google offer that the iPhones don’t. But for basically anyone who uses iOS, the iPhone 13 Pro (and Pro Max, if you don’t mind its weight) is a worthy upgrade.</p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs (iPhone 13 Pro)</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic with 6-core CPU and 5-core GPU</p><p><strong>Storage</strong>: 128/256/512GB or 1TB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Display</strong>: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED with ProMotion up to 120Hz</p><p><strong>Display resolution</strong>: 2,532 x 1,170 (460 ppi)</p><p><strong>Rear triple cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.5 wide-angle camera with sensor-shift OIS; 12MP f/1.8 ultra-wide camera (120-degree FOV); 12MP f/2.8 77mm telephoto camera </p><p><strong>Front camera</strong>: 12MP f/2.2 TrueDepth camera</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: iOS 15</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: &quot;Up to 22 hours video playback&quot;</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: Lightning port with fast wired charging at 20W (up to 50 percent in 30 minutes); Support for MagSafe wireless charging up to at 15W; Qi wireless charging at up to 7.5W.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>:  5.78  x 2.82 x 0.30 inches; 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.65 mm</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 7.19 ounces; 204 grams</p><p><strong>Fingerprint sensor</strong>: No</p><p><strong>Waterproofing</strong>: IP68</p><p><strong>NFC</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Headphone jack</strong>: No</p></div><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs (iPhone 13 Pro Max)</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic with 6-core CPU and 5-core GPU</p><p><strong>Storage</strong>: 128/256/512GB or 1TB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Display</strong>: 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR OLED with ProMotion up to 120Hz</p><p><strong>Display resolution</strong>: 2,778 x 1,284 (458 ppi)</p><p><strong>Rear triple cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.5 wide-angle camera with sensor-shift OIS; 12MP f/1.8 ultra-wide camera (120-degree FOV); 12MP f/2.8 77mm telephoto camera</p><p><strong>Front camera</strong>: 12MP f/2.2 TrueDepth camera</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: iOS 15</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: &quot;Up to 28 hours video playback&quot;</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: Lightning port with fast wired charging at 20W (up to 50 percent in 30 minutes); Support for MagSafe wireless charging up to at 15W; Qi wireless charging at up to 7.5W.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>:  6.33 x 3.07 x 0.30 inches; 160.8 x 78.1 x 7.65 mm </p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 8.46 ounces; 240 grams </p><p><strong>Fingerprint sensor</strong>: No</p><p><strong>Waterproofing</strong>: IP68</p><p><strong>NFC</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Headphone jack</strong>: No</p></div><p>Photos by David Imel (<a href="https://twitter.com/DurvidImel">@DurvidImel</a>)</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc56df1f-faf0-4842-ad1c-26be4447fa12</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 14:30:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632493374</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T14:23:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/25c681c0-1cfe-11ec-b1ed-aff3c2fd2c38" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/25c681c0-1cfe-11ec-b1ed-aff3c2fd2c38" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A blue iPhone 13 Pro Max and a starlight gold iPhone 13 Pro standing with their backs facing the camera.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
