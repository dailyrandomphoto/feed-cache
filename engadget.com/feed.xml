Many preterm babies require a NICU stay, with the average length being <a href="https://www.marchofdimes.org/peristats/pdfdocs/nicu_summary_final.pdf">13.5 days</a>. Though I had little idea of what I was doing when I brought home my twins from the NICU, I did know that I was going to continue to monitor their vitals stats using an Owlet sock. My partner and I had become accustomed to checking their heart rate and pulse ox levels on a hospital monitor, and being able to get that information at home helped us build confidence in our role as non-professional caretakers to two very tiny humans.</p><p>In both the NICU and online parenting forums, multiple people recommended the Owlet. It’s specifically these fans the brand was responding to with the recent release of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$359 Smart Sock Plus" href="https://fave.co/3s8iRLT">$359 Smart Sock Plus</a>, a larger sock with an updated algorithm that can be used on children up to five years old or 55 pounds. That’s a decent leap from the previous 18-month/30-pound cut-off that my kids just passed. The company claims that 72 percent of the parents it polled said they’d like to use their Smart Socks for longer, and that certainly included me.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><p>The third-generation Owlet monitoring system featured a redesigned “butterfly” style sensor that fit into an updated fabric sock, and it’s more of the same with the Plus. You’ll find the same removable sensor with a protruding button that attaches to the Base Station for wireless charging when not in use, along with the same winged, Velcro attachments for switching it between socks.</p><p>It’s also still lightweight, easy to remove and replace, and fast charging. Owlet says a full charge takes an hour and a half, and you can get eight hours worth of use with only 20 minutes of charging. That bore out in testing when I was able to grab a full night&#39;s worth of battery life in the time it took to finish our bedtime routine with the kids. The compact, more subtle Base Station is also the same as the one found on the smaller smart sock model.</p><p>The new sock has a similar construction, too, including a soft, flexible fabric strip that fastens around the ball of the foot to keep the sensor at the outside of the little toe. And there’s  an ankle band to secure the whole thing in place. The Smart Sock Plus comes with the same four initial sock sizes: left and right for under 12 pounds; and left and right for 12 to 30 pounds; plus an expansion pack of left and right socks for 30 to 55 pounds. It’s worth noting that currently the Smart Sock Plus is only available in the classic Mint Green shade, and not the Deep Sea Green or Dusty Rose colors.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d2840f0-26e5-11ec-bfda-eec8beb8a019" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus" data-uuid="1e774dc4-1cd5-3a0d-9aed-03c810c5f7bc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amber Bouman/Engadget</div></figure><p>I had issues with the fit on the last sock, and was pleased to find that the Plus version for larger kids (30-plus-pound) seemed less prone to unintentional slippage. I say unintentional because my kids have just learned to work Velcro so they can, very purposefully, take the sock off. While they were proud of themselves for their accomplishment, this underscores the challenge in offering a sock for older children: It might be a fight to get them to keep it on.</p><p>One of the user reviews I read for the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:original Owlet sock" href="https://fave.co/3nrMk0U">original Owlet sock</a> recommended putting a regular sock on over the smart one to keep it from sliding around. I tried that and found that it worked well for my son, but less so with my daughter who has better dexterity. That’s unlikely to solve the issue for the length of the sensor’s life, though I’d expect older children can be taught to wear the sock to sleep. I asked Owlet what they recommend to keep the sock in place in these instances, and they, too, suggest using a regular sock or footie pajamas. They also claim some parents wait until their kids are asleep to put the Smart Sock on, but those folks are braver than I.</p><p>Because the sock fits better, I had fewer disconnection error alerts. In fact, the only time I received alerts due to a misaligned sock were times when my kids had actually removed it. Given that frequent unexplained alerts were one of my pain points with the last version, it was nice to see that had improved. I got consistent readings when they were in fabric socks or footie pajamas, and also when they were under a blanket. What’s more, I had no problem keeping the Base Station in my office, next door to my kid’s room; it was still easily able to keep everything connected.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4cd18a0-26e5-11ec-bd7a-14ebc24f1380" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus worn underneath a fabric sock" data-uuid="48051c2e-33bc-3d6a-bc01-66dfdae06a41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amber Bouman/Engadget</div></figure><p>I will say that the sock still seemed to run out of battery quicker than the second-generation one did, but it was comparable to the third gen. While the sock could reliably make it through an  evening of monitoring (roughly 7pm to 7am), I occasionally saw low-battery warnings in the morning. However, these warnings indicated that I had less than four hours of runtime, which seems like plenty of time.</p><h2>Software</h2><p>Every time I set up an Owlet device, I hit a snag. This time, instead of connecting to the Owlet in my WiFi settings, I was instructed to go through the Privacy settings and toggle on the Local Network option. But the Owlet app kept telling me to check the permissions, even after I’d turned them on. And off. And on again. And closed and restarted the app.</p><p>Although this is the first time I had to call Owlet support for a resolution, I was able to easily get through to a live person and resolve the problem in a little over five minutes (thanks again, Jill!). I haven’t had any problems since.</p><p>As with the rest of the Plus experience, the app remains largely unchanged. The difference here are the updated algorithms that Owlet is using to calculate data for kids in the 18-month to five-year range. Because the sock can now fit more kids, the algorithm has to accommodate for physical changes over time. Owlet says a good example is heart rate, which changes as a child gets older.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8d630690-26eb-11ec-997e-18c73b9bd37e" alt="Owlet app" data-uuid="1139dd9f-b84b-342a-b97c-6075c0f65bd4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Owlet</div></figure><p>Aside from that, you still get a dashboard to access each child’s profile, which contains their live heart rate and pulse ox data, the battery life of the sock and WiFi connection status. If you’re also using the Owlet Cam as a video monitor, you’ll see the feed here. Previous days’ data can be found under History, which includes an overview and info graphs. This has always been one of the most useful portions of the app for me, as it showed me the trends on when my twins were — and were not — doing well sleeping.</p><p>As I mentioned, I haven’t yet had any false alerts, though I’m not sure what to chalk that up to — faster internet at my new house? A better fit on the sock? Upgraded algorithms? Either way, it’s nice to report on a better experience, especially given the price difference between the $359 Plus and the $299 third-gen sock.</p><h2>The competition</h2><p>There aren’t a ton of products out there similar to Owlet’s sock. The company has seemingly cornered the market on baby wearables that measure pulse ox and heart rate, but there are a few other noteworthy devices in this space. One of them is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Nanit system" href="https://amzn.to/3CVwm5O">Nanit system</a>, which pairs a camera with an item of the company’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Breathing Wear clothing" href="https://amzn.to/3F25X8v">Breathing Wear clothing</a> to monitor respiration and sleep as well as provide a video feed. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3ieFquT">Complete Monitoring System</a>, which includes app subscription extras like two days of video history, comes in at  $379. In testing, the Breathing Wear worked as advertised and the camera offered an impressively clear 1080p HD feed. I’ve also used the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Pampers Lumi" href="https://amzn.to/3kPgHPn">Pampers Lumi</a>, a solid $187 camera-slash-wearable that only tracks diaper changes and sleep patterns. However, it looks like the sensor is hard to come by right now — we&#39;ve reached out to Pampers to see if the Lumi sensor and companion diapers are still widely available.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e4b61890-26e8-11ec-bba7-7ffff1e21273" alt="Owlet Smart Sock Plus " data-uuid="b48176e5-aa57-3873-9e72-d217e16b5df3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Owlet</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Owlet Smart Sock Plus" href="https://fave.co/3s8iRLT">Owlet Smart Sock Plus</a> fills a need for people who are already on the Owlet bandwagon: It allows parents to continue using a product they like and are comfortable with for a longer period of time. Other than better algorithms and a larger sock, there’s not much difference between the Plus and the third-gen device — which was absolutely an improvement over the version that came before it. I’d expect the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$69 expansion pack" href="https://fave.co/3kOe1ld">$69 expansion pack</a> to sell well, as it provides what current customers will need to upgrade to the next sock level, but  $359 is a high barrier to entry for a baby monitoring system that may not work for your sleep routine. That said, if you’re an Owlet customer who is happy with your current smart sock, it’s unlikely you’ll regret snagging an expansion pack when your kiddo has gotten big enough.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/owlet-smart-sock-plus-review-130525360.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">806c6f42-64a7-4aae-808d-b302965efc16</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 13:05:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633608665</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T12:11:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f976d590-26ba-11ec-b1fc-ad705d650fee" width="8192" height="6719" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d93c9470-fab6-11eb-9efb-f01f4b675e7f" width="2000" height="1429" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Owlet / Weston Colton]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Owlet Smart Sock Plus]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Owlet Smart Sock Plus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Star Trek: Lower Decks’ is ready to let its ensign heroes rank up]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The following contains minor spoilers for season two, episode nine of ‘</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek: Lower Decks" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/a1Wk1R"><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em></a><em>.’</em></p><p>Throughout the history of Star Trek, it’s generally accepted that a member of Starfleet will spend about three years as an <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ensign">ensign</a>, the lowest officer rank in the fleet. It’s the position given to new Starfleet Academy graduates, and the status of the four protagonists on <em>Lower Decks</em>. However, as the show wraps up its second season and prepares for a third, it does bring the character’s status as “lowly ensigns” into doubt. This week’s episode touches on, though doesn’t solve, the problem by exploring the universal concept of a “lower decker.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In “wej Duj” (the first full Klingon language episode title in the entire franchise), the <em>USS Cerritos</em> is in transit between missions, giving the crew some much-needed downtime. Mariner, Rutherford and Tendi use their day off to spend some personal time with senior officers, which sends the bridge-crew-friendless Boimler into a panic since he notes that this will give them an edge when it comes to getting promoted. He spends most of the episode trying and failing to get buddy-buddy with various officers. If this all feels like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-six-130040781.html">C-plot level shenanigans</a>, well, it is. But as a result the show takes its biggest leap yet to fill out its narrative in this episode.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fccecba0-26e5-11ec-af3f-142af226e5b9" data-uuid="c870b61f-e18d-308c-b2dd-d09724f9a5b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>“wej Duj” is Klingon for “three ships,” and we get to see the crew of the Klingon vessel <em>Che’Ta</em>, where a very ambitious Boimler-esque Klingon is trying to get in good with the current captain of his ship. Old school fans will remember that authority on Klingon ships is assigned by force, with an officer assuming command by killing the previous captain. This young Klingon isn’t quite that ambitious, but he’s perfectly happy to walk the captain’s pet targ if it helps him become first officer.</p><p>The episode also shows us the happenings on a nearby Vulcan craft called <em>Sh’Vhal</em>, where a lower decker named T’Lin there has been messing with the sensors and as a result, notices some strange readings in the area that she takes to the captain to investigate. The captain agrees to the search, but he also reprimands her for undertaking such unnecessary adjustments to the ship.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3ef8d070-26e6-11ec-b7d7-4006d6c0b2a0" data-uuid="83281cc2-9a0b-3a77-bc54-8b6b2b7b4b33"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>The entire episode could have been played as a “slice of life,” with the three plot lines never intersecting and it still would have been a fairly successful installment of the series. This isn’t our first look at the internal life of a Klingon ship, but it is our first look at a Vulcan crew, and playing those distinct societies against Starfleet culture is a great bit of world building. Star Trek has never been good about showing life outside Starfleet, only lightly touching on the grander world in more recent shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/picard"><em>Picard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20trek%3A%20prodigy"><em>Prodigy</em></a>. And even those still have tenuous Starfleet connections. <em>Lower Decks</em> has relished showing us the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-070123812.html">larger universe</a> that the characters exist in, and here we now get that same sense of expansion without the Starfleet worldview intruding.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the storylines stand apart, far from it. All three ships and their plot lines come together in the end, not only pulling the episode into one cohesive narrative, but also continuing — and starting to resolve — a plot line that has lingered since the end of season one, namely the Pakleds. We finally find out why they suddenly became a huge threat in the Alpha Quadrant, thanks to a series of machinations reminiscent of storylines on <em>The Next Generation</em> and <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. Not everything is revolved by the end, presumably leading into a big finale next week. It’s fair to say that seasons one and two basically comprise one full story arc, with season three possibly presenting a fresh slate.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2f76380-26e6-11ec-9fbf-c762142a472a" data-uuid="99aeaad1-776e-3fa9-bced-dcee5da97be3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>And it’s just in time, too. Each season has represented a year on the <em>Cerritos</em>. Next season will mark three years on the Cerritos for Boimler, Tendi and Rutherford, placing them in line for a promotion. And unlike Mariner’s purposeful self-sabotage, her friends have all shown themselves to be competent, trustworthy officers. There’s no reason they shouldn’t be promoted — and technically Brad Boimler already was at the end of last season, having only been demoted and sent back to the <em>Cerritos</em> because of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-two-kayshon-his-eyes-open-070038927.html">transporter accident on the USS Titan</a>.</p><p>While it’s unlikely (though not impossible) that the characters will get promoted in the season finale, it will have to happen some time next year for the show to maintain its verisimilitude in Star Trek canon. The <em>Cerritos</em> doesn’t have the luxury of being trapped in the Delta Quadrant as an excuse to keep its ensign an ensign (poor Harry Kim). But there’s hope, given what happens to our Klingon and Vulcan lower deckers by the end of “wej Duj.” Those outcomes, alongside the episode wrapping on Brad giving sage advice to a young crewman, seem to hint that the show is comfortable with letting our protagonists move on when it’s time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-nine-130037874.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d3f13522-630f-43aa-b90c-1787ccabfa00</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 13:00:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633563475</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T23:38:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f860a6a0-26e6-11ec-beff-55d35cafb35d" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f860a6a0-26e6-11ec-beff-55d35cafb35d" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["wej Duj" Ep# 209 -- Tawny Newsome as Ensign Beckett Mariner,  Noel Wells as Ensign Tendi, Eugene Cordero as Ensign Rutherford,  and Jack Quaid as Ensign Brad Boimler of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

Another fun (but also easy to overdo) feature is moving overlays that let you add animated snowflakes, sparkles and the like to photos, then export as an MP4 to share on social networks.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/16357de0-2764-11ec-9fff-8d2e9710c4c4" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Adobe Elements gains new AI smarts for auto re-framing, pet photo fixes and more" data-uuid="60f91cc6-a8a7-3ae7-aeef-807318ac2d33"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p>More practically, Photoshop Elements 2022&#39;s &quot;Guided Edits&quot; feature has new options that let you easily make adjustments. Some of those include a pet photo adjustment that lets you remove leashes and collars, adjust lighting and colors, refine fur and more. You can also extend or replace photo backgrounds, create arty double-exposures (above), remove distracting elements from a photo and adjust shadows and highlights.&nbsp;</p><p>Premiere Elements, meanwhile, uses Sensei AI to automatically re-frame videos to fit in social-friendly aspect ratios for TikTok, Instagram and other apps — while still retaining important content. It also comes with two new Guided Edits options: the ability to add animated overlays and adjust shadows and highlights. Other new features include new slideshow styles, and GIF playback in the Organizer.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5d7d0510-2764-11ec-b3fb-a88542ca52c8" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Adobe Elements gains new AI smarts for auto re-framing, pet photo fixes and more" data-uuid="5ae278d7-602a-3822-bb57-b1c37f957590"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p>Both apps now support automatic updates, so novice users have &quot;no need to deal with dialog boxes,&quot; according to Adobe  (this would be a non-starter for most professional users).

Both apps are <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop-premiere-elements/whats-new.html">now available</a> as a one-time purchase for $100 each, or $150 in a bundle — students and teachers can get both for $80.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobe-elements-gains-new-ai-smarts-for-auto-re-framing-pet-photo-fixes-and-more-130010843.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1f4384be-036c-48d4-b71c-8cb7c35409e2</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 13:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633607901</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T11:58:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/79a6e580-275f-11ec-ab6d-ab19dac99f13" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/79a6e580-275f-11ec-ab6d-ab19dac99f13" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Adobe Elements gains new AI smarts for auto re-framing, pet photo fixes and more]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Adobe Elements gains new AI smarts for auto re-framing, pet photo fixes and more]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US Justice Department forms a cryptocurrency enforcement team]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The United States Department of Justice has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/deputy-attorney-general-lisa-o-monaco-announces-national-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team">formed</a> a team of investigators to look into the use of cryptocurrency for criminal purposes. To be specific, the group, called National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET), will <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-sets-up-national-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team-11633565435?mod=rss_Technology">tackle</a> cases committed by virtual currency exchanges and groups and individuals involved in money laundering. Members will also investigate mixing and tumbling services, which charge customers a fee to send cryptocurrency to an address while also concealing the source of the funds. In addition, they&#39;ll work on tracing and recovering assets lost to fraud or ransomware extortion demands.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the DOJ&#39;s announcement, the team will combine the expertise of its money laundering and asset recovery section with its computer crime and intellectual property section. It will also include experts from US Attorneys&#39; Offices. The group will be under the supervision of Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A. Polite Jr., though the Justice Department is still looking for an individual to lead it. DOJ is looking for someone &quot;with experience with complex criminal investigations and prosecutions, as well as the technology underpinning cryptocurrencies and the blockchain,&quot; in particular.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The hope is that NCET can provide the whole department and other government agencies with the expertise in cryptocurrency and blockchain needed to investigate and prosecute the growing number of cases related to the technology today. There&#39;s been a rise in cybercrime cases these past years, including ransomware attacks wherein bad actors target companies across industries to hold their networks hostage in exchange for payment via cryptocurrency.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of them have had real-world consequences. The attack on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/colonial-pipeline-restarts-operations-060635370.html">Colonial Pipeline</a> caused fuel shortage in the East Coast, for instance, while the various attacks on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fbi-feds-warn-hospitals-ransomware-threat-063452673.html">hospitals</a> around the world put people&#39;s lives in danger. The Biden administration is even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-ransomware-meeting-212310054.html">hosting a meeting</a> with 30 countries later this month to discuss the threat of ransomware attacks to global economy and national security.</p><p>Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Today we are launching the National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team to draw on the Department’s cyber and money laundering expertise to strengthen our capacity to dismantle the financial entities that enable criminal actors to flourish — and quite frankly to profit — from abusing cryptocurrency platforms. As the technology advances, so too must the Department evolve with it so that we’re poised to root out abuse on these platforms and ensure user confidence in these systems.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-justice-department-cryptocurrency-enforcement-team-122126252.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af05b133-9fb0-491a-b5eb-aecfa34beaba</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 12:21:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633608916</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T12:15:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3d592260-2763-11ec-bfcf-4cbcac4bf7a1" width="3936" height="2624" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3d592260-2763-11ec-bfcf-4cbcac4bf7a1" width="3936" height="2624" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kameleon007 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[close up shot of bitcoin shot in las vegas, nv. usa on September 6, 2021]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[bitcoin]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[What kind of show was Marvel's ‘What If…?’ meant to be?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains spoilers for the season finale of Marvel&#39;s </em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:&#39;What If&#x002026;?&#39;" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/x9NDA5"><em>&#39;What If…?&#39;</em></a></p><p>All season there were hints that <em>What If…?</em> was going to be more than just an anthology show. The fact that it debuted week to week, instead of dropping <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-visions-marvel-studios-what-if-season-one-153109359.html">all at once</a> like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Wars Visions" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/QObrBP"><em>Star Wars Visions</em></a>. The Watcher’s repeated insistence that he must not interfere, an assertion begging to be tested. Stephen Strange noticed the Watcher’s presence. And then Ultron becomes aware of not just the Watcher, but of the entire multiverse, setting the stage for this week’s finale. It’s like a “greatest hits” of the series so far, with room for future adventures.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-eight-disney-plus-120027634.html">last episode’s altercation</a>, the Watcher knows he cannot handle Infinity Ultron by himself, instead enlisting the help of the heroes we’ve met over the entire season, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-disney-plus-animated-episode-one-183034023.html">Captain Carter</a>, T’Challa Starlord and Party Thor. The one exception is a Gamora who appears to have been working with Tony Stark, pulled into the group with little explanation, making me wonder if I had missed an episode. (Though the Watcher’s dismissal of Tony was pretty funny.)</p><div id="b175abecf6e74239b9473dbe3d59cffc"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CjiHZ95Hh6k?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Where other episodes have had to rush through their premises, showing us how those particular realities differed from the main Marvel Cinematic Universe, the finale has eight prior episodes to lean on for background so it got straight to the action. What we got was a tight, zippy episode that’s sure to be a crowd-pleaser, with lots of fun banter between the characters. And it certainly helped that a few were played by their original live-action actors, most notably Benedict Cumberbatch and Hayley Atwell.</p><p>However, even this episode left some loose ends and a lot of doors open, with Arnim Zola and Killmonger locked in eternal battle, Black Widow finding a new team and Captain Carter discovering her lost-long love still alive. These all feel ripe for sequels that this show appears more than willing to deliver.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d4cb5b0-26e1-11ec-b37f-879c5916558b" style="height:872;width:1920;" alt="Captain Carter" data-uuid="f4ca54f6-e6be-3d48-ab65-9606339f3892"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>It raises the question of what <em>What If…?</em> actually is. The show was originally presented as an anthology — which is still one of the tags it’s given on Disney+. Traditionally an anthology is a collection of stories or essays by different authors, but as early as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/the%20twilight%20zone"><em>The Twilight Zone</em></a> television has defined an anthology as a program with new characters and scenarios every episode, regardless of whether the writers are the same. Even now, while every episode of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/black%20mirror"><em>Black Mirror</em></a> is written by Charlie Brooker, you’ll still see it described as a science fiction anthology.</p><p>The episodes of <em>What If…?</em> are written by a variety of people including showrunner A.C. Bradley, but that’s par for the course with any television program, even the serialized ones. But its anthology nature was due to the fact that even if they were similar to characters we already knew and loved from the live-action productions, the characters were still different people. This is actually alluded to in the finale, when Gamora’s machine fails to destroy the Infinity Stones because it was only built to crush the gems in her universe, not in all realities.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/95cc3280-26e0-11ec-a4ef-3ae3307af144" style="height:868;width:1869;" alt="T&#39;Challa, Gamora, Killmonger, Thor" data-uuid="178900c9-1e31-396f-8d4a-15530953ff2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>But ultimately, even if it’s different universes, it’s one multiverse and thus, one continuity. To watch this finale you would have needed to see every episode of the series this season, instead of cherry-picking only the episodes you were interested in. I know a few people who were only watching the concepts that intrigued them, but in the end they’ll have to watch every episode in order to make sense of certain plot points. While the show has been careful not to intrude into the main MCU and becoming “required” viewing in that expanding behemoth, it’s still building an essential canon of its own.</p><p>It’s still rather up in the air over what part <em>What If…?</em> is meant to play. Having many of the actors reprise their roles from the films was a way to tie it into the larger universe, while the change in medium from live-action to animation set it apart from not just the films, but series like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html"><em>WandaVision</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-episode-six-captain-america-disney-plus-133033258.html"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a>. Being billed as an anthology gave it license to do a lot less long-term character building than those two programs as well.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bb9fe1f0-26e0-11ec-ad5f-5cae286cd18c" style="height:869;width:1917;" alt="The Watcher with the " data-uuid="4e7da64a-5b1d-322e-b634-5ed2dfd7c01c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>However, in practice it feels a lot like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-loki-finale-episode-six-163019038.html"><em>Loki</em></a>, which completely changed how we saw the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe — it even downplayed the Infinity Stones at several points! Taking major threats of the MCU and greeting them with a ¯&#92;_(ツ)_/¯ says that even <em>What If….?</em> isn’t all that interested in retreading old stories and is ready to move on with the rest of the Marvel properties. It may be inessential canon, but it still wants to keep up with the main event. And that’s not how an anthology is supposed to work.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-nine-series-finale-120020465.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e2a3e1a9-2e81-438e-ab30-e2878595346b</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 12:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633552417</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T20:33:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/dbb450c0-26e0-11ec-bfe5-45f8aab9af84" width="1920" height="871" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/dbb450c0-26e0-11ec-bfe5-45f8aab9af84" width="1920" height="871" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Infinity Ultron]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Infinity Ultron]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Audio-Technica’s new fast-pairing true wireless earbuds only cost $79]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/audio-technica-ath-s220bt-headphones-budget-multipoint-pairing-voice-assistant-215046389.html">Audio-Technica</a> has released a new true wireless earbuds model that you can add to your holiday shopping list if you&#39;re looking for a pair that costs below $100.

The company offers a range of designs at affordable prices that undercut much of the competition. What&#39;s more, Anker doesn&#39;t make many sacrifices when it comes to sound, performance and features to keep those prices low. Today, the company debuts the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Liberty 3 Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3uMod0Q">Liberty 3 Pro</a>: a $170 follow-up to 2019&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-anker-soundcore-wireless-earbuds-liberty.html">Liberty 2 Pro</a> that adds active noise cancellation (ANC), improved audio and a refined design.&nbsp;</p><p>The Liberty 3 Pro has a similar look to the Liberty 2 Pro with silicone fit wings and a shape that&#39;s built to relieve pressure and discomfort. Anker says the new earbuds are 30 percent smaller than the previous model and they&#39;re IPX4 rated for moisture protection. On-board controls return to give you easy access to music and calls. Inside, the company explains that &quot;an upgraded dual driver configuration&quot; developed alongside nearly two dozen Grammy winning producers powers its &quot;best sounding model to date.&quot; Anker&#39;s Astria Coaxial Acoustic Architecture (ACAA) has been updated to version 2.0, enabling more detail without distortion. The Liberty 3 Pro also supports Sony&#39;s LDAC codec for wireless audio, a standard that transmits more data over Bluetooth for high-res listening.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0580f360-271b-11ec-bf11-cac4f42d60f8" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro" data-uuid="92df80be-8983-3bc5-8b1f-1a1cef1d582f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Anker/Soundcore</div></figure><p>The biggest addition here is ANC. The noise-cancelling setup employs Anker&#39;s HearID tech that can tailor the sound profile of the earbuds to your hearing. After a quick hearing test, HearID can increase certain frequencies that may be more difficult for you to hear in each ear. HearID also powers the active noise cancelling tech here, automatically customizing the level of noise reduction based on the clamor around you. Anker says the system creates an individual sound profile that accounts for in-ear pressure as well. The Liberty 3 Pro is also outfitted with AI-powered background noise reduction for calls and three ambient sound modes for a variety of scenarios.</p><p>Anker says the Liberty 3 Pro will last up to six hours on a charge with ANC on or up to eight hours with noise cancellation disabled. The included case supports wireless charging and holds up to three additional charges. A quick-charge feature will give you three hours of use in just 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Liberty 3 Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3uMod0Q">Liberty 3 Pro</a> is available today for $169.99 (£139.99/€159.99/$199.99 CAD) in black, white, gray and purple color options.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-liberty-3-pro-true-wireless-earbuds-100052557.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9ea8045a-383d-45c8-b036-bcdbe0c9c20b</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 10:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633608156</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T12:02:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/20629700-2703-11ec-b5af-ab9bd6f77a12" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/20629700-2703-11ec-b5af-ab9bd6f77a12" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anker/Soundcore]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sky's first smart TVs point to Comcast's box-less future]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sky’s long journey to move beyond satellite TV is finally over, as the company launches its brand new internet-only TV platform. <a href="https://www.sky.com/glass">Sky Glass</a> is the company’s first own-brand Smart TV, one which ditches the home-mounted satellite dish and set-top box in favor of pulling all of its content from the internet. The company’s pitch is to centralize not just its own content inside the one box, but to act as a universal platform for every streaming TV app currently available on the market. Not to mention that putting it all inside a single piece of hardware reduces the clutter that builds up underneath the family TV.</p><p>On the hardware front, Sky Glass comes in three sizes, 43-, 55- and 65-inch displays, all of which have 4K Quantum Dot LED screens with 10-bit HDR+ and Dolby Vision. It ships in five colors: Blue, White, Green, Pink or Black, with matching remote controls, speaker fascias and stands. On the audio front, Sky says that you won’t need a soundbar with this kit, since the hardware comes with six-speaker Dolby Atmos sound, as well as a subwoofer, built-in.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>(The company added that, consequently, Sky Glass is up to 50 percent more energy efficient than your current set-up since you’ll not be powering a discrete set-top-box and soundbar.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/673be4b0-2753-11ec-a38b-3c22fc2bf4d1" alt="Image of the new Sky Glass voice remote" data-uuid="600bcfd9-d1db-3d19-a30d-49d1a078bf07"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sky</div></figure><p>But Sky’s value proposition isn’t just that it’s selling a fancy TV with some streaming bits inside, but a whole new way to end the infinite scroll. With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-29-sky-q-review.html">Sky Q,</a> the company already positioned itself as a curation layer between you and the content you want, but this takes it a big step forward. It’s designed to aggregate all of the catalogs from all of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-netflix-is-now-available-on-sky-q-boxes.html">streaming apps</a> available and let you pick and choose what you want from one centralized location. That means you can watch episodes of the same TV series, in order, even if they’re hosted on different streaming platforms.</p><p>Sky Glass is also voice-activated, with the wake word ‘Hello Sky,” and you should be able to access all of your favorite shoes, live TV and play listed content with it. But if you’d prefer, you can use the new remote, which is a simplified version of the touch remote already available for Sky Q, albeit with backlit buttons for better night-time operation.</p><p>At the same time, Sky also announced a 4K webcam which it is planning to release at some point in the future which will sit on top of the TV and offer Portal-esque video calls. This system also offers motion-tracking and skeleton tracking for both motion gaming and customized workouts, and it even looks like a Kinect. When this hardware is available, you’ll also be able to have watching parties for live TV even when you’re not in the same location.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/83e9f700-2753-11ec-bfff-3d3befa6701e" alt="Image of three sizes of Sky Glass TV" data-uuid="283c77cd-d1ce-3fb7-bfe5-d6a9b67db071"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sky</div></figure><p>Of course, given that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-22-comcast-to-acquire-sky.html">Sky is owned by Comcast</a> and the company is rumored to be working on its own TV platform, you can assume for yourself that a rebranded version of Sky Glass is coming to the US. <a href="https://www.protocol.com/comcast-xclass-tv-hisense"><em>Protocol</em></a> reports that Comcast has been working on a product, dubbed the XClass TV, for the US market. In addition, Sky says that Glass will not just be available in the UK and Europe, but also in Australia and other markets across the next year or so.</p><p>Price-wise, Sky Glass will cost £649, £849 or £1,049 depending on if you opt for the 43-, 55- or 65-inch version. It will be available in the UK on October 18th. But the company says that it expects more people to buy it on a monthly subscription contract, much as it does with phones via Sky Mobile, for a minimum contract term.

You&#39;ll also have to deal with backdrafts, exploding walls and complex sprinkler systems. But you won&#39;t just be trying to put out a blazing inferno in the game: You also have to rescue survivors (cats included) and investigate every nook and cranny to find hidden secrets that would help you figure out the site&#39;s true nature, as well as solve the mystery behind the fire.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Benard developed <em>Nuclear Blaze</em> under his own company called Deepnight Games.

He also said that he wanted to create a game his 3-year-old could play, which is why the title has a &quot;Kid mode&quot; with simpler level designs, rules and gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Nuclear Blaze</em> will be available for download on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1662480/Nuclear_Blaze/">Steam</a> on October 18th.

The game company has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxnr2FAADAs">posted</a> a Steam Deck teardown video that shows how to pry open the handheld console while simultaneously urging you to keep the system shut. It&#39;s certainly possible to get in — it&#39;s just that you might just cause more problems than you solve.</p><p>As Valve explains, the Steam Deck is tightly packed with highly customized parts, including the thumbsticks. While the company is promising replacements for various parts in the &quot;coming months,&quot; there are chances you&#39;ll damage the system on your way in through static electricity or other mishaps. There can also be consequences to using off-the-shelf parts. A stock SSD might interfere with the handheld&#39;s thermals, for instance. You might even compromise the integrity of the console just by opening it, according to Valve.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This likely won&#39;t deter you if you insist on fixing your Steam Deck yourself. Valve clearly expects at least some unofficial repair attempts given its parts plan. However, it&#39;s evident the <em>Half-Life</em> maker wants you to rely on Valve&#39;s own technicians, or at least third-party pros, in the event the Deck breaks.

While multiple TV providers carry the channel, an OAN accountant testified in 2020 that 90 percent of OAN parent Herring Networks&#39; revenue, tens of millions of dollars, came through deals with AT&amp;T-owned platforms that included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-direc-tv-spinoff-051610804.html">DirecTV</a>.</p><p>OAN founder Robert Herring separately testified that AT&amp;T executives inspired him to launch the network in 2013 after looking at a media landscape with relatively few conservative outlets. Court documents also indicated that AT&amp;T offered to buy a 5 percent equity stake in OAN and Herring&#39;s lifestyle channel AWE, although the two ended up choosing a different agreement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>OAN even claimed that one AT&amp;T executive, Aaron Slator, offered to put the channel on DirecTV in return for help lobbying for the satellite broadcaster&#39;s 2014 merger. The Herring family also supposedly met FCC officials to talk about the merger and speak well of AT&amp;T in news stories. AT&amp;T has denied making the offer linked to Slator, and an OAN lawsuit alleging a breach of that deal supposedly led to AT&amp;T adding OAN to DirecTV&#39;s selection.</p><p>AT&amp;T rejected claims of undue influence in responses to <em>Reuters</em> and <em>The Verge</em>. The carrier maintained that DirecTV &quot;does not dictate&quot; channel programming, and that DirecTV merger support was &quot;never a condition of or part of&quot; any content carriage agreement. In a Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ATTNEWS/status/1445828767113416706">statement</a>, AT&amp;T maintained it &quot;never had a financial interest&quot; in OAN and that the decision to carry the network was now in DirecTV&#39;s hands.</p><p>The concern, as you might imagine, is that AT&amp;T may have contributed to the spread of misinformation without being held to account like online providers and other companies. On top of YouTube suspending OAN following a violation of COVID-19 misinformation rules, voting machine maker Dominion <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/10/1026509404/dominion-sues-conservative-media-oan-newsmax-2020-election">sued the network</a> in August this year over unproven claims of election fraud.

Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mdkbobfo">says</a> that as of January 31st, all app submissions (including updates) will need to include the option.</p><p>The company announced this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1">requirement</a> alongside other App Store guideline changes at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2021-event-roundup-212428441.html">Apple Worldwide Developers Conference</a> in June as part of a push to give users more control over their data. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712795/apple-developer-account-deletion-app-reporting"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, Apple is only requiring developers to let people &quot;initiate deletion of their account from within the app,&quot; so apps might send you to a website or even a chat with an agent before you can actually close your account.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It remains to be seen how useful this requirement will actually be in practice, given the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-spot-avoid-dark-patterns/">tricks</a> many developers employ to encourage you to remain as a user. Still, if you have an account in an app, deleting it will be slightly less of a headache, which can&#39;t be a bad thing. This will hopefully make it easier for people to ditch subscriptions and apps they aren&#39;t actually using.&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere, App Store pages on iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey (which is still in beta) now have a <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=j5uyprul">Report a Problem button</a>, so you can flag any issues or concerns you have with an app to Apple.

RTS,S, also known as Mosquirix. Specifically, the WHO says it should be deployed for children in sub-Saharan Africa and other areas where with moderate to high malaria transmission. The announcement follows in the footsteps of huge vaccine advancements around the COVID-19 pandemic. To be clear, though, RTS,S isn&#39;t an mRNA vaccine, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mrna-tech-we-used-against-covid-could-help-us-finally-beat-malaria-153045965.html">have the potential to make an even bigger impact </a>on malaria and other diseases that have affected humans for ages.</p><p>“This is a historic moment. The long-awaited malaria vaccine for children is a breakthrough for science, child health and malaria control,” WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. “Using this vaccine on top of existing  tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>RTS,S has an efficacy rate of preventing 39 percent against malaria cases and 29 percent of severe cases, based on trials in Africa involving small children. That may seem particularly low, but when combined with other anti-malarial tools, like bed netting with insecticide, the WHO says the vaccine could potentially save tens of thousands of lives annually. The organization estimates that more than 260,000 African children (out of around 500,000 people total) die from malaria every year.</p><p>Crucially, the WHO also says RTS,S can be deployed easily, is safe to use and is cost effective to roll out. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/oct/06/who-endorses-use-of-worlds-first-malaria-vaccine-in-africa">According to The Guardian</a>, the company behind the vaccine, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), says it will supply up to 15 million doses annual at no more than 5 percent of the production cost. The WHO and GSK are looking for additional sources of funding from partners and governments.&nbsp;</p><p>RTS,S is just the start, though. Thanks to mRNA-based technology, which can teach our bodies how to respond to specific diseases, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-23-malaria-vaccine-becomes-first-achieve-who-specified-75-efficacy-goal">Oxford University&#39;s R21 vaccine </a>is up to 77 percent effective when it comes to preventing malaria. And based on tests so far, it&#39;s proven to be safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;For centuries, malaria has stalked sub-Saharan Africa, causing immense personal suffering,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said in a statement. “Today’s recommendation offers a glimmer of hope for the continent which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease and we expect many more African children to be protected from malaria and grow into healthy adults.”</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/who-approves-first-malaria-vaccine-africa-191356314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c09ed25f-d058-4a88-a652-23e2db312725</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 19:13:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633581633</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T04:40:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Epidemic & Plague]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d57a8290-26d8-11ec-abd8-fae8b233b420" width="3300" height="2150" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d57a8290-26d8-11ec-abd8-fae8b233b420" width="3300" height="2150" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[panom via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aedes mosquitoe is sucking blood on human skin.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aedes mosquitoe is sucking blood on human skin]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro can now boost other people's voices during conversations]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It can sometimes come across as rude when you leave your earbuds in while chatting with someone.

That&#39;s a record for the company, and comes close to the $750 million Amazon received to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-13-amazons-hq2-split-between-nyc-arlington-virginia.html">build its second headquarters</a>.</p><p>The largest incentive was a $322 million, 12-year property tax abatement pending in Markham, Illinois, followed by a nearly $151 million, 15-year tax exemption package in Monroe County, New York. Good Jobs First said this was likely a cautious estimate as some of the deals involve undisclosed tax deals and grants.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The payouts came despite an uncertain economy and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-settles-employees-working-condition-criticisms-090134228.html">complaints about Amazon&#39;s working conditions</a>, including modest pay, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-warehouse-policies-020626313.html">strict monitoring</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-automated-injuries-211813202.html">high injury rates</a>. Officials may attract more jobs to their area, but they won&#39;t necessarily be high-quality jobs that grow the economy. It&#39;s also unclear if there&#39;s a net job benefit — <em>FT</em> cited an Economic Policy Institute study showing that an Amazon warehouse attracted workers from other companies rather than expanding the overall workforce.</p><p>Amazon has justified the incentives through overall job creation and economic investment. In a statement, the company said it created over 400,000 jobs in 2020 alongside a $150 billion investment. It added that it was often taking incentives available to any company settling into a given location, not just Amazon.</p><p>Even if there is an overall employment increase, though, the question is whether or not Amazon should be accepting tax incentives in the first place. The company made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-q1-2021-210221698.html">more profit in the first year of the pandemic</a> than it did in the previous three years, raking in $26.9 billion. The firm doesn&#39;t exactly need those tax breaks to survive, and the money could be used to improve communities and working conditions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-us-tax-breaks-delivery-171657659.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c59ec4f7-a4ed-49a5-ba86-c46a2c4ec22c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 17:16:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633540621</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T17:20:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Budget, Tax & Economy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/19e16bf0-26c1-11ec-bf67-f482aa14316a" width="7551" height="5034" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/19e16bf0-26c1-11ec-bf67-f482aa14316a" width="7551" height="5034" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MediaNews Group/The Riverside Press-Enterprise via Getty Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[EASTVALE, CA - AUGUST 31: A worker sorts out packages in the outbound dock at Amazon fulfillment center in Eastvale on Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2021.
