First, the app will show a notification “a handful of times.” A separate prompt may also appear if users try to view a post that’s hidden behind a warning screen. These warnings appear on <a href="https://help.instagram.com/251027992727268">“sensitive content”</a> that might not break Instagram’s official rules, but could be considered borderline, such as “suggestive” images or photos of medical procedures.

It takes only a few minutes to set up the Nest Audio via the Google Home mobile app, and once that&#39;s set, you&#39;re able to ask the Google Assistant to play music from a bunch of sources like Spotify, YouTube Music, Apple Music and Pandora.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the Nest Audio is your first smart speaker that costs more than $50, you&#39;ll immediately notice the difference in audio quality. It&#39;s leaps and bounds better as a music player than the Nest Mini or the Echo Dot, and it sounds even better if you have two Nest Audios playing in stereo mode. It even has Media EQ, which adapts the audio to better fit what you&#39;re listening to (like music vs. podcasts), and Ambient QI, which changes the Assistant&#39;s output so you can hear it better in louder environments.</p><p>And as with other assistant-toting devices, you&#39;ll be able to call upon the Google Assistant when you have a question that needs answering, when you want to know what the weather will be like tomorrow, when you want to turn on your smart lights and more. If you&#39;re an Android user or simply use a bunch of Google services every day, the Nest Audio is one of the best smart speakers you could add to your home that will make it easier for you to access your information at any time.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-sale-80-best-buy-bh-photo-141327523.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7db1f73d-8a22-4955-b03d-7ef774271c69</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 14:13:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630332810</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T14:13:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/31e02730-9bbd-11eb-bfaa-c7494697b3e8" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/31e02730-9bbd-11eb-bfaa-c7494697b3e8" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Audio smart speaker sitting on a wooden tablet next to a green plant, against a blue wall.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Nest Audio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[China further slashes kids’ gaming time to just three hours a week]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>China has announced a further crackdown on the amount of time children can play online video games, with the new limit set to just three hours per week. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/china-limits-minors-to-just-three-hours-of-online-gaming-a-week?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, reporting from local news sources, says that platforms like Tencent can now offer gaming to kids between the hours of 8-9pm on Friday, weekends and public holidays.</p><p>It’s a significant and notable reduction from the previous rule, which had been generally capped at 1.5 hours per day in 2019. Earlier this month, Tencent was forced to cut <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tencent-limits-honor-of-kings-play-time-122045915.html">the amount of time minors could play</a> the smash hit mobile title <em>Honor of Kings</em> to just an hour on weeknights and two hours on the weekend. The added restriction is likely to impact the share price of companies in this space, which has seen recent instability.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Historically, China has always had an aversion to video games, albeit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-01-30-china-console-ban.html">with more nuance than most people believe.</a> The country has, however, amplified anti-game rhetoric in recent years, and on August 3rd, a key state-owned news outlet described video games as “spiritual opium.” The piece, as reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/technology/china-video-game-tencent.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, went on to outline all of the ways in which gaming could harm Chinese kids.</p><p>As well as the time limit for online gaming (and we’ve asked our colleagues to clarify if any of this can also apply to offline and console gaming), authorities want all titles hooked up to some form of anti-addiction system. Other new rules include companies keeping (real) name data for all users, more reporting on the use of in-game transactions, and more regulatory scrutiny more generally.</p><p>It’s not clear how much of an impact this will have in the real-world since Tencent says minors make up a very small part of its overall business. But given the country’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-data-privacy-rules-130029351.html">continued</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-tencent-wechat-youth-mode-lawsuit-211811555.html">assault</a> on various parts of the tech industry, it’s likely that there will be more hoops for businesses to jump through in future. A week ago, meanwhile, South Korea declared that it would ditch its infamous &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-gaming-shutdown-law-end-163212494.html">Cinderella Law</a>,&quot; banning video gamers from playing between midnight and 6am, saying that it is respecting children&#39;s rights.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/china-cuts-kids-gaming-time-132539606.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bec46028-5711-4f0d-bd04-2c3cb8ad030a</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 13:25:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630328750</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T13:06:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ba531d50-e39a-11eb-be9a-4c89a3a19292" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ba531d50-e39a-11eb-be9a-4c89a3a19292" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barcroft Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SHANGHAI, CHINA - JULY 7, 2021 - Photo taken on July 7, 2021 shows Tencent's Honour of Kings exhibition stand in Shanghai, China.

The new platform will, Fossil promises, offer a number of quality-of-life improvements including faster loading times and the ability to fast charge to 80 percent in half an hour. In addition, the new watches will offer continuous heart-rate tracking, a new blood oxygenation sensor and a new built-in wellness app for more reliable activity tracking. Oh, and users will be able to make tethered calls thanks to an integral speaker and microphone combo, should you need the feature.</p><p>Naturally, Fossil has made it clear that these Gen 6 watches, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-5-no-wear-os-upgrade-and-gen-6-205355585.html">unlike the current (and older) models</a>, will be compatible with<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html"> Wear OS 3</a> and users can expect to receive the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-wear-os-3-update-release-date-160045459.html">update due in 2022</a>. The new watches will launch in two sizes: a 42mm case with three color options, while you can get four different paint jobs if you opt for the 44mm case. Both devices, however, have a 1.28-inch round AMOLED display (326 ppi), with 8GB of built-in storage and 1GB of RAM. Since a big part of Fossil’s sales pitch is customizability, you’ll also get a wide variety of strap choices to help make these devices more suited to your personal style, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Fossil Gen 6 watches will cost between $299 and $319, with pre-orders open now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b6b0c2cf-e5e0-4cf5-a2b6-ac41b0b5adec</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 13:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630329520</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T13:18:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a48010d0-0976-11ec-9eff-747c26dd3d0a" width="1800" height="1201" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a48010d0-0976-11ec-9eff-747c26dd3d0a" width="1800" height="1201" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fossil]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fossil Gen 6]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fossil Gen 6]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Our verdict on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ll get into Samsung’s bigger foldable below, but first let’s talk about a new, kind of, PS5. You might have struggled to get a PS5, though anecdotal evidence suggests a lot of us have been able to find consoles as stores stock up, but that hasn’t stopped Sony sneaking out a <em>slightly </em>new model. According to a teardown of the digital (no disc-drive) PlayStation 5 by Austin Evans, there seems to be a<a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-revision-smaller-heatsink-142922979.html"> smaller, lighter heatsink</a> and a new screw to attach the console to its stand.</p><p>So no, this isn’t like the smaller PlayStation consoles the company likes to roll out during a console’s midlife — it’s way too early for that. It does show that the company is looking for ways to shave production costs and get these consoles into profitability.</p><p>Interestingly, Sony already stated it’s selling the disc-based PS5 at a profit. Games consoles typically sell at a loss for the first couple of years after launch. Hopefully, that smaller heatsink will still handle the bigger, more lavish titles on their way to the PS5.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review</a></h2><h3>Doing the most and yet not enough</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/897c7a90-074f-11ec-b775-b068887a84ef" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 on a table with an S Pen Pro in front of it." data-uuid="6686c526-24dd-3a04-884d-ab02c7c33fe5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure></a><h3></h3><p>The Z Fold 3 is an impressively refined foldable, with water-resistant hardware that feels sturdier than before.

On someone else&#39;s profile, it displays better against your background, but it&#39;s still tiny and the edges are cut off by the circular format of newer gamerpics.&nbsp;</p><div id="827f64da19dd4c7cbb7fb3b3a1d9d906"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Before we even think about what looks good, we need to look at the inconsistency in the profile page/editor that started this thread. 360 gamerpics look fundamentally different here depending on whether you&#39;re looking at your own profile (broken) or someone else&#39;s (intended). <a href="https://t.co/m5o0sXHfMx">pic.twitter.com/m5o0sXHfMx</a></p>— Eden Marie (@neonepiphany) <a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1430771417298083848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The grey border issue turned out to be a bug introduced at some point, so Marie was able to fix that first.  Then, she took advantage of the Xbox UI&#39;s ability to handle transparency in images by overlaying the square gamerpic into a transparent circular image.

Marie noted that the fix will be introduced for all Xbox users still rocking those old gamerpics. &quot;PS, since there have been questions, this will need to roll out with other console updates, Insiders first, and this will change how all 360 gamerpics show up on console, not just certain ones,&quot; she noted. The fix has now been added to the Alpha ring, so if all goes well, it should fix everybody&#39;s messed up Xbox 360 gamerpics in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/your-tiny-xbox-360-gamerpic-may-finally-display-properly-on-modern-consoles-103031164.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e2f4381d-912a-4272-bedd-da8db718569e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 10:30:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630311177</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T08:13:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5a4f580-0960-11ec-afda-2a58abd767b5" width="1425" height="912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5a4f580-0960-11ec-afda-2a58abd767b5" width="1425" height="912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eden Marie]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Your tiny Xbox 360 gamerpic may finally display properly on modern consoles]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Your tiny Xbox 360 gamerpic may finally display properly on modern consoles]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[VW customers will soon have a choice for in-car 4G connectivity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Volkswagen has <a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1590">unveiled</a> a new feature for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-12-volkswagen-siri-shortcuts-car-net.html">Car-Net</a> connected vehicle service that lets you get 4G data from two major US telecoms.

The fact that it&#39;s soldered directly to the motherboard rather than being a separate component is one contributing factor in its middling 5/10 repairability score, according to a new teardown from YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8uaCrGkca8"><em>PBKreviews</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The Pixel 5a is Google&#39;s midrange 5G smartphone and a direct successor to the popular 5G <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-samples-specs-price-150053038.html">Pixel 4a</a>. Though a bit larger than the latter and now water-resistant, it&#39;s equipped with nearly the same internal components, including a Snapdragon 765G, 6GB of RAM and a 60Hz panel. It&#39;s a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">solid</a> mid-range phone for $449, though essentially a stopgap device until Google unveils the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">Pixel 6</a> family that will use its all-new Tensor mobile chip.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="03b8867a857048189a3d77b19c222352"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8uaCrGkca8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The good news is that the 6.34-inch OLED display is relatively easy to replace, as you can pull it off simply by heating it up and using a pry tool to pop it off. It&#39;s also fairly straightforward to get access to the battery and motherboard, once you remove the numerous screws and pry off the large metal cover.</p><p>From there, however, things get trickier. The battery is glued solidly to the case and the pry tab meant to help remove it is &quot;pretty useless,&quot; according to <em>PBKreviews.</em> Instead, they had to use isopropyl alcohol to loosen the glue before they could pry the battery out. The other issue is that the USB-C port is attached directly to the motherboard, so making repairs to it would be &quot;difficult,&quot; according to the video.&nbsp;</p><p>All told, however, the Pixel 5a appears to be slightly easier to repair than its predecessor. While you might not try to fix it yourself, that means it could be a bit easier to find local service if you&#39;d rather not send it away to Google. The teardown also shows a solid-looking device with water resistance as a big new benefit — so hopefully, all that will add up to a reliable device that won&#39;t need repairs in the first place.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-teardown-shows-that-its-still-a-challenge-to-repair-051041017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb1a6546-5228-4d10-9683-47de1876a9f4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 05:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630300240</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T05:10:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d2ac9b80-094a-11ec-bfe5-411c73857c0f" width="2048" height="1153" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d2ac9b80-094a-11ec-bfe5-411c73857c0f" width="2048" height="1153" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5a teardown shows that it's still a pain to repair]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5a teardown shows that it's still a pain to repair]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 will reportedly offer larger cases and screens]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a> might be a more substantial redesign than you think. <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claims Series 7 will come in larger 41mm and 45mm case sizes (up from 40mm and 44mm) with bigger screens to match.

You could get in touch on a remote camping trip without any cell service, and without buying a separate satellite communicator.</p><p>The iPhone would supposedly use a modified version of Qualcomm&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-18-qualcomm-snapdragon-x60-5g-mmwave-qtm535-ultrasaw-rf-filter.html">X60 modem</a> to talk to satellites. It&#39;s not certain if satellite support would be limited to certain apps, although we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that were the case.

A <em>Bloomberg</em> rumor from 2019 had Apple developing satellite technology for the iPhone, but the team reportedly hoped to ship a product within five years — two years might be too early, assuming the leaks were accurate in the first place. There are also logistical questions to address, such as the choice of service providers. Satellite service has historically been expensive, and it might be a tough sell even if you regularly venture beyond cellular coverage.</p><p>Many expect Apple to launch the new iPhone lineup in September. It&#39;s not certain if this would be limited to Pro models or reach the entire iPhone range.</p><p>If there is a satellite linkup, though, Apple might have a stronger hook for the new iPhone than rumored display and camera upgrades. This would be the first mainstream smartphone offering connectivity virtually anywhere on the planet, and competitors might not match the feature for a while.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-leo-satellite-communication-165409961.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">84f12ff9-556b-4494-8843-28ed436b3a9e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 16:54:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630256052</ingested><modified>2021-08-29T16:54:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/abd9b4e0-08e4-11ec-bb9b-e9045122ef78" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/abd9b4e0-08e4-11ec-bb9b-e9045122ef78" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max handheld]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max handheld]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite drops to all-time low price of $71 in one-day sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now might be a good time to buy an e-reader for school — or that end-of-summer vacation.

YouTube creator Austin Evans has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taKKVBVoKhg">posted</a> a teardown that shows the revised PS5 Digital Edition (that is, the no-disc model) is using a smaller, likely lower-cost heatsink. While this shaves a whopping 0.66lbs off the weight, it also raises the exhaust temperature by a few degrees. This may not be a major issue, as Evans did not measure the temperature of the system&#39;s internal components. Should that exhaust temperature indicate higher operating temperatures, though, it would be worth noting if you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">upgrade your SSD</a> or plan on stuffing your system into a crowded media cabinet.</p><p>There are subtler changes as well, including an easier-to-use stand screw and tweaked connections to the WiFi chip, although it&#39;s not clear if or how the wireless changes make a practical difference. It&#39;s also uncertain how many of these changes translate to the disc drive version of the PS5.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company hasn&#39;t officially explained its design choices for the updated PS5. As Evans speculates, however, the refreshed PS5 may be a cost-cutting measure that reflects lessons learned in the several months since the machine&#39;s debut. Now that Sony knows how well the cooling and other components perform, it knows where it can afford to use cheaper, simpler parts.</p><p>The timing is apt. In its first-quarter earnings briefing, Sony <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/ps5-is-no-longer-selling-at-a-loss/">told investors</a> it was no longer selling the disc-based PS5 at a loss — this latest design could make the Digital Edition profitable that much sooner. While the choice won&#39;t thrill gamers with bitter memories of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-09-04-new-study-finds-close-to-one-quarter-of-xbox-360s-fail-within-tw.html">overheating Xbox 360s</a> (however unlikely a repeat might be), it might play an important role in Sony&#39;s long-term health.</p><div id="1bc7ceb67b9b4d399da2917505a687e4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taKKVBVoKhg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><strong>Update: </strong>This article was changed after publishing to clarify that the new model&#39;s exhaust temperature was higher, rather than the temperature of the components inside the system.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-revision-smaller-heatsink-142922979.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8086dd3a-b840-4d32-9e5a-e22dabf3cd9a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 14:29:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630333683</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T14:28:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/8a98d6b0-9eba-11eb-bfe9-02e092290fb2" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/8a98d6b0-9eba-11eb-bfe9-02e092290fb2" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aaron Souppouris/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5 with Xbox Series X in background]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5 with Xbox Series X in background]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google reportedly offered Netflix a special discount on Play Store fees]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has been accused of playing favorites in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-suit-211116918.html">treatment of Android app developers</a>. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22645974/google-netflix-class-action-antitrust-play-store-commission">reports</a> a newly <a href="https://twitter.com/MActon93/status/1431398527658119172">unsealed</a> consumer lawsuit against Google alleges the company offered to take a &quot;significantly reduced&quot; cut of Netflix&#39;s Play Store revenue in order to quell the streaming giant&#39;s &quot;displeasure.&quot; Netflix, Spotify and Tinder all supposedly tried to get around the requirement to use Play Store&#39;s in-house billing system, and deals like this were meant to keep Netflix using Google&#39;s payment platform.</p><p>The same filing also <a href="https://twitter.com/MActon93/status/1431398632134037505">includes</a> a claim that Google&#39;s normal revenue share is arbitrary. Where the company typically asks for a 30 percent cut of Play Store purchases, it apparently determined that it could break even with just six percent.  Internal communications suggest Google chose the 30 percent share for no reason &quot;other than copying Apple,&quot; according to the lawsuit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked Google for comment. In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, a spokeswoman maintained that developers were bound to the same policies as &quot;all other developers,&quot; and that there were efforts to back app makers with &quot;enhanced resources and investments.&quot; These initiatives were evidence of &quot;healthy competition&quot; in operating systems and app stores, Google said.</p><p>If the allegations are true, though, that wouldn&#39;t be the case — Google would have given Netflix a sweetheart deal not available to other Play Store developers. The company wouldn&#39;t be alone, either.

The hackers, known as Belarus Cyber Partisans, have been leaking information they found on sensitive police and government networks. They first started defacing government websites as an act of protest in September 2020 following the country&#39;s disputed election, in which Alexander Lukashenko&#39;s win was widely considered as fraudulent. But they also publish the information they get on Telegram, where they have 77,000 subscribers.</p><p>The group told the publications that it&#39;s made up of 15 IT and cybersecurity experts working in the country&#39;s tech sector. None of them are &quot;professional hackers,&quot; a spokesperson told <em>Tech Review</em>, with only four out of 15 doing the actual &quot;ethical hacking.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Partisans&#39; most recent attacks gave them access to drone footage from the government&#39;s crackdowns on protests last year and the Ministry of Interior Affairs&#39; mobile phone surveillance database. They also apparently got access to emergency services&#39; audio recordings, as well as video feeds from road speed and isolation cell surveillance cameras. The data the group released over the past weeks include lists of alleged police informants, personal information about top government officials and spies, police drone and detention center footage and secret recordings captured by the government&#39;s wiretapping system.</p><p>If the Cyber Partisans have been effective in their efforts to infiltrate the government&#39;s networks, it&#39;s thanks to the help they get from another group called BYPOL. They reportedly reached out to BYPOL in December 2020 for guidance — after all, the group is made up of former Lukashenko officials who defected from the government and current ones working to topple the regime from the inside.&nbsp;</p><p>BYPOL provides them information on how to infiltrate government organizations and on the structure of the administration&#39;s databases. In return, the Cyber Partisans provide the group with information it can use to investigate the regime&#39;s crimes. BYPOL publishes information on its own Telegram channel and creates documentaries, one of which was cited at a congressional hearing that led to the US <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-europe-belarus-6adf187862771cb7869cd3bb777fd92a">imposing sanctions</a> against the Lukashenko regime.</p><p>The Cyber Partisan spokesperson told <em>Tech Review</em> that they&#39;re using cyberattacks to &quot;paralyze as much as possible of the regime&#39;s security forces, to sabotage the regime&#39;s weak points in the infrastructure and to provide protection for protesters.&quot; Their ultimate goal is &quot;to stop the violence and repression from the terroristic regime in Belarus and to bring the country back to democratic principles and rule of law.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/belarusian-hackers-overthrow-lukashenko-government-200457163.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">694a0358-1d83-4d3d-a16f-fe6f9216103a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 20:04:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630180756</ingested><modified>2021-08-28T19:59:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Unrest, Conflicts & War]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c662ff00-f918-11eb-b6f7-f6733293a6f9" width="2344" height="1563" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c662ff00-f918-11eb-b6f7-f6733293a6f9" width="2344" height="1563" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PAVEL ORLOVSKY via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko looks on during a press conference in Minsk on August 9, 2021. - Belarus's strongman leader Alexander Lukashenko dismissed international criticism on August 9, 2021, a year after claiming to win a disputed election that led to unprecedented protests in the country. In power since 1994, Lukashenko has been cracking down on opponents since the mass protests that erupted after the vote, deemed unfair by the West.  (Photo by Pavel ORLOVSKY / BELTA / AFP) (Photo by PAVEL ORLOVSKY/BELTA/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BELARUS-POLITICS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft might not deliver Windows 11 updates to PCs with old CPUs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft might let you install Windows 11 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-supported-processors-update-175544403.html">on PCs with older processors</a>, but that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll get the full experience you&#39;d find on newer machines.

The company wants you using a relatively recent computer with Windows 11, even if that means having to wait until you can justify a PC upgrade.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-updates-withheld-older-cpus-194632054.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a484933-845d-4b58-ac3f-1307c2ba3a16</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 19:46:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630179995</ingested><modified>2021-08-28T19:46:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/679640d0-0832-11ec-af79-441226f55ea1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/679640d0-0832-11ec-af79-441226f55ea1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 11 Insider Preview with widgets]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 11 Insider Preview with widgets]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Smartwatch demand surged 47 percent this spring]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The smartwatch market doesn&#39;t appear to be cooling down any time soon — if anything, it&#39;s heating up.
