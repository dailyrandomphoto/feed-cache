As expected, the Solterra shares many similarities with Toyota’s upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-bz4x-details-140056332.html"><ins>bZ4X crossover</ins></a>. That should come as no surprise since the two automakers jointly developed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-bz4x-suv-concept-202644349.html"><ins>e-TNGA powertrain</ins></a> at the heart of both electric vehicles.</p><p>Subaru’s crossover features a 71.4 kWh lithium battery that the automaker estimates will provide 220 miles of range on a single charge.

The dual motors can output 215 horsepower and 248 lb.-ft of torque.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e8c48740-489a-11ec-bd5f-bfa7d825bc49" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Subaru Solterra interior" data-uuid="07062844-56f9-3de0-baca-3e4d19c61baf"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Subaru</div></figure><p>The Solterra will come with Subaru’s symmetrical all-wheel-drive system and X-Mode feature. The latter offers better traction in off-road conditions. Inside the cabin, there’s a 12.3-inch touchscreen display that works with both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. The Solterra will also mark the debut of a couple of new safety technologies for Subaru. First, there’s a 360-degree “Surround-View” camera the company says allows for better situational awareness. Second, there’s a feature called Safe Exit Assist that will warn your passengers if a vehicle is approaching as they’re about to exit the car.</p><p>Subaru will start selling the 2023 Solterra sometime in mid-2022. The automaker has yet to announce final pricing for the crossover, but it’s expected to start somewhere in the $39,000 range.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/subaru-solterra-crossover-details-182128199.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">930f34e8-cfc5-488a-a272-7f47c00cf6f3</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 18:21:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637259455</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T18:17:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c7015700-489a-11ec-bef7-3e06c1273a06" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c7015700-489a-11ec-bef7-3e06c1273a06" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Subaru]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Subaru Solterra]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Subaru Solterra]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple reportedly aims to debut a fully self-driving car in 2025]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple may be sharpening the focus of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-and-kia-are-no-longer-talking-to-apple-about-an-autonomous-ev-083235132.html">long-in-development electric car</a>. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle">sources</a> claim Apple is now shifting its attention to a fully self-driving car, not just a more conventional vehicle with semi-autonomous features.

Where Apple had recently targeted a launch in five to seven years, the sources said it was now aiming for 2025, or just four years.

However, full self-driving has many challenges, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-new-york-city-130044539.html">difficult-to-predict traffic</a> and weather problems like snow.

I’m not really an arts and crafts kind of guy. Sure, I’ll do the occasional project with my four-year-old. I also like to make things (beer, music, small electronics) and generally have a pretty strong DIY streak. But I don’t really traffic in the same mediums as the traditional <a href="https://cricut.com/en_us">Cricut</a> crowd: cardstock, fabric, vinyl, et cetera.</p><p>This sort of stuff is more my wife’s territory. She made the decorations, bouquets and the invitations for our wedding. She crochets <a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/164298499/bubble-bobble-blanket?ref=shop_review">video-game</a><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/121410693/galaga-blanket?ref=shop_review">themed</a><a href="https://www.etsy.com/listing/126104773/take-this-throw?ref=shop_review">blankets</a>. And she made a robot costume out of cardboard and aluminum foil for our kid. So honestly, I was kind of hoping she’d come to the table with a bunch of project ideas to put the $300 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Cricut Explore 3" href="https://fave.co/3nraY3E">Cricut Explore 3</a> through its paces. Suffice to say, she let me down. (I still love her, though.) So I was largely on my own as I tried to figure out what exactly an Engadget review of a Cricut machine should look like.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I guess to start, we should establish what exactly a Cricut is. It’s basically a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-14-nomad-883-desktop-cnc-machine.html">desktop CNC machine</a> that’s designed to cut things like fabric, paper and vinyl, as opposed to wood or metal. The whole idea is to let your average DIYer quickly and easily cut intricate shapes and patterns with extreme precision.</p><p>The first thing I did: I made a delicate vinyl decal of a mixtape to stick on my laptop. Then I made one to stick on one of my guitar pedals. And a floppy disk decal that I put on top of a canvas board I painted. You get the picture. Basically, I just cut out a bunch of decals.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/25027110-4885-11ec-bdfc-8ef80def4369" alt="Mixed Tape decal cut with Cricut Explore 3" data-uuid="281bd7ca-9a91-331e-8c69-35d2438bb845"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The process for doing these things is almost idiot proof. The Design Space app (available for macOS, Windows, Android and iOS) where you layout your creations is incredibly simple to use and offers access to over 1,000 free images and over 250 projects, ranging from simple stickers to 3D cardboard masks. And if that isn’t enough, you can pay for a <a href="https://cricut.com/en_us/cricut-access.html">Cricut Access</a> membership (starting at $9.99 a month) that opens up over 200,000 images and “thousands” of projects. Or you can pay individually for licensed content from the likes of Disney, Marvel, Warner Bros. and Sesame Street. Or you can upload your own images.</p><p>The latter is pretty simple so long as you stick to line drawings, but it does require occasional cleanup work. For instance, I downloaded a Superman silhouette for my son to color in (he wanted to make his own superhero stickers). But before I could cut it out using the Cricut I had to select and remove the background, otherwise it’d have just cut out a square.</p><p>The instructions in the app for predesigned projects are thorough and clear. And that’s even true for relatively complex ones that require multiple cutting tools, markers and several different materials. It walks you through each step as you load a pen to draw on white cardstock, then cut the shape out, before having you swap in a different color card stock and the scoring tool. And for really involved designs, like the <a href="https://cricut.com/blog/new-in-design-space-3d-masks/">3D cardboard masks</a>, you’ll find a PDF with assembly instructions. (Well, most of the time at least. I only discovered after I cut the pieces for the cardstock fox I tried to build that it had &quot;tips for assembly&quot; as opposed to detailed instructions.)</p><section data-eng-breakout="1896da0fb355404fb5b8ae5ab505a695" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2505cc70-4885-11ec-bbf3-d8689a1cb78d" alt="3D Fox made with Cricut Explore 3"></section><p>The more intense projects that call for multiple materials and multiple cuts to be assembled after the fact can feel a little daunting at first. But as long as you don’t try to rush through without reading directions it’s relatively easy to figure out.</p><p>The bigger issue is, you end up needing <em>a lot</em> of stuff. The Cricut Explore 3 comes with a fine point blade, other tools such as the scoring stylus and foil transfer tool are sold separately, or as part of a bundle with the Cricut starting at $350 (which, if you’re in the market for one as a newcomer I’d highly recommend). But even if you get a bundle, you’ll still probably need to snag some extra stuff if you want to venture beyond stickers, decals and iron-ons.</p><p>See, part of the pitch for the latest Cricut machines is their compatibility with “Smart Materials,” which you’re able to load without using the special mat normally required to hold things in place for cutting. This is, to be clear, a huge advantage. One, it just means there’s fewer variables and less than can go wrong. But it also allows the latest Cricut machines to cut up to 12 feet of material in a single shot, whereas previous versions topped out at 24-inches with a mat. That’s great if you want to create room-covering decals.</p><section data-eng-breakout="317538a1d0894ac28c53777c9a3b8f10" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64c7b570-4886-11ec-b7c2-667e6dc48fce" alt="Cricut Explore 3"></section><p>The one shortcoming is that all the Smart Materials are adhesive in some form. There’s paper and cardstock sticker options, permanent or temporary vinyl decals, and iron-on. If you want to cut regular cardstock, paper or fabric you’ll still need to get mats, which come in four different levels of grippiness. They’re not prohibitively expensive; most people should be able to get by with the 12x12 variety pack, which includes light, standard and strong grip mats that cost $41. But it’s something to be aware of if you want to make greeting cards, paper banners or some of these undeniably awesome <a href="https://d2e2oszluhwxlw.cloudfront.net/img/home/2021/maker/img/CricutMaker3_2_3DAnimal_463x579auto-compress-format-q-75.jpg">3D cardboard figures</a>.</p><p>If you do get those mats you’ll be greatly expanding the cutting capabilities of your Cricut, too. The Explore 3 can cut over 100 different materials from felt, to foil, to leather and light chipboard. If you spring for the $400 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Cricut Maker 3" href="https://fave.co/3Cu8Xru">Cricut Maker 3</a> instead, that number jumps to over 300 materials, including acetate, various types of wood sheets and a host of additional fabrics.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8b7f8350-4886-11ec-b5ff-c73e5247da4a" alt="Cricut Explore 3" data-uuid="2b148102-a529-3dec-beca-4f7891a193f1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Creating your own designs or projects from scratch is a little more complicated. It’s simple enough to slap a few shapes and some text down on the virtual canvas. But If you want to make your own 3D figures, multilayered greeting cards, or print then cut custom stickers, things get a little more difficult. Frankly, it’s something that’s beyond my skill set.</p><p>There are templates in Design Space to help get you started laying out projects. But I found them only minimally useful. They’re basically just generic sketches of objects like bowls, mugs and guitars to give you a rough idea of what your decal or whatever will look like. But they’re not customizable enough to really be relied on for building out a complex design. I used the hoodie template to create an iron-on Spiderman emblem for my son’s Halloween costume. (It was chilly and I knew he wouldn’t want to cover his Spiderman costume with a jacket.) But I was still mostly left guessing when trying to figure out what the final product would look like.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/25055740-4885-11ec-a1ff-d307bc2cf356" alt="Spiderman sweatshirt made with Cricut Explore 3" data-uuid="c8aa5d2e-4551-35d6-aea7-d6b4d86fdf58"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>At the end of the day, the most important thing to know about  Cricut machines is that they demand patience. Patience to figure out how to use it. Patience to navigate some of the complex projects. And patience to actually put those projects together. (Let me tell you, peeling thin cardstock off one of the mats without tearing it is no easy task.) But, it also feels like magic at times. Watching it as it writes impossibly small and delicate numbers on pieces of cardboard or cuts out intricate designs in vinyl is impressive. Obviously, more complex patterns require more time to cut out, but the Explore 3 is still impressively fast.</p><p>Can I say that a Cricut is absolutely worth the investment? No. It really is going to depend on your particular crafting needs and style. I’m not going to use the Cricut every day, or even every week. But I could see once a month dusting it off to customize something for my kid or to put a personal touch on a small project I’ve been working on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cricut-explore-3-review-precision-cutting-machine-arts-and-crafts-170053940.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ccd06f88-6d6f-4545-95ef-2360394f5fca</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 17:30:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637258497</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T18:01:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/25061a90-4885-11ec-9ffa-131f06f95f61" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/25061a90-4885-11ec-9ffa-131f06f95f61" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cricut Explore 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cricut Explore 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's second-gen Pixel Stand is available for pre-order]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google&#39;s second-generation Pixel Stand wasn&#39;t even an option by the time the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">Pixel 6</a> shipped, but it&#39;s here now... well, almost. The company has begun taking <a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US">pre-orders</a> for the new wireless charging dock for $79. It won&#39;t ship until mid-December, so you might want to order quickly if it&#39;s a gift for the Android enthusiast in your life.</p><p>The new Pixel Stand is more monolithic than its predecessor, but also more powerful. It can charge the Pixel 6 Pro at up to 23W (21W for the regular Pixel 6) and has a fan to keep everything cool. And while it will charge many Qi-compatible devices at up to 15W, Google phone owners receive some extra perks. You can use the Pixel 3 and newer models as makeshift Google Assistant smart speakers, display personal data like calendars while unlocked or simply turn your phone into a photo frame.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The catch, as you might gather, is that you don&#39;t strictly need the Pixel Stand if you want an upright wireless charging dock.

The company has <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/?p=176463">introduced</a> a desktop version of Edge with an efficiency mode that &quot;significantly&quot; lowers CPU and memory use, potentially extending your battery life at the expense of raw performance. The feature should kick in when your battery is lo, although there&#39;s also a settings toggle when you&#39;d like to take control.</p><p>You should also have an easier time updating your passwords, whether in response to a breach or just for caution&#39;s sake. The passwords section in Edge&#39;s settings now lets you easily update passwords for sites with a &quot;change&quot; button. The convenience only works for some sites right now, but Microsoft promised compatibility with more sites in the &quot;coming months.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Edge will also add a few shopping features that might help you make smarter choices. An upcoming price alert will let you know if a must-have item is more affordable, while price comparison and history tools are coming to Android users later in November. UK shoppers using Bing can also tap Good On You&#39;s rating system to buy fashion based on social responsibility and sustainability scores.</p><p>Battery-saving features aren&#39;t new. Google gave Chrome some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chrome-86-battery-saving-experiment-223253471.html">longevity-focused improvements</a> last year, for instance. Efficiency mode might give Microsoft a way to stand out, though, and it might be vital if you&#39;d rather not switch browsers (or limit the sites you visit) just to keep using your system for a little while longer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-browser-efficiency-mode-170017525.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eb6bf2b8-8901-4ce6-9f1e-30c9a295ad46</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 17:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637253037</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T16:30:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/503263a0-7775-11ea-ac9a-87ce7aa33368" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/503263a0-7775-11ea-ac9a-87ce7aa33368" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jon Fingas/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge logo (2020)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge logo (2020)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat adds memories and exploration features to the Snap Map]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/snapchat/"><ins>Snapchat</ins></a> announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-snap-map-places-140030542.html"><ins>Map Layers</ins></a>, features for the Snap Map built around local content.

The performance is nothing to sniff at, with the M1 Pro proving more adept at creative tasks like video editing and 3D rendering than last year&#39;s M1 chip. As for battery life, the laptop ran for over 16 and a half hours in our testing.</p><p>Apple made sure there were plenty of ports on the latest model, after going several years with minimal connectivity on MacBook Pros. There are three Thunderbolt 4 ports, a MagSafe power port, HDMI connectivity, a 3.5mm headphone jack and an SD card reader, but unfortunately no USB-A port. To accommodate all of those, the laptop is a little bulker than its predecessors. That said, the trade off is likely worth it for most people, given that you might not feel the need to carry around a connector hub to connect all your peripherals anymore.</p><p>The MBP has a Liquid Retina XDR display with Mini-LED backlighting that&#39;s capable of outputting 1,600 nits of brightness and support for a 120Hz refresh rate.

The chief executive was quick to admit there was a &quot;lot of risk&quot; and that SpaceX might not succeed, but he figured the team would at least make &quot;a lot of progress.&quot;</p><p>There could be around a dozen further launches in 2022, Musk added. The timing also hinges on an FAA environmental impact review of SpaceX&#39;s Boca Chica launch facility. The agency intends to finish its review before the end of 2021, but a delay might push back upcoming Starship launches.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whenever Starship reaches orbit, the vehicle might become economical relatively soon afterward. Musk reckoned SpaceX could start selling Starship launches for less than Falcon 9 in roughly two years. That, in turn, could win valuable business and help SpaceX build more Starships for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-18-who-is-yusaku-maezawa-spacexs-first-lunar-tourist.html">space tourism</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-plans-floating-spaceports-230144280.html">journeys to Mars</a>. Musk told meeting members Earth might need about 1,000 launch systems for truly interplanetary life, and he intended to produce Starships relatively quickly.</p><div id="e27cb6debb274f1a913245d7f4d33f80"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rLydXZOo4eA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-flight-january-144550856.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6ce6d70e-d29f-411b-ac83-1088054fd98c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 14:45:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637256019</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T17:20:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d3cb2750-4876-11ec-b4ad-3c2f74c820a9" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d3cb2750-4876-11ec-b4ad-3c2f74c820a9" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SpaceX, Flickr]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SpaceX Starship and Super Heavy stack]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SpaceX Starship and Super Heavy stack]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's Pixel 6 is up to $100 off right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The early Black Friday sales we saw on Google smart home devices are back just about a week before we get to Black Friday proper. And there are a few other devices included this time around — like Google&#39;s new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Pixel 6 smartphone" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/b3PdPv">Pixel 6 smartphone</a>, which is $100 off at Best Buy if you buy and activate today, or $50 off if you activate later. Regardless of which you choose, those are the best sales we&#39;ve seen on the handset since it debuted last month.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/b3PdPv" id="8d7dc11f134f4b88a76241f6d01b71b6" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Pixel 6 at Best Buy starting at $499</a><p>We gave the Pixel 6 a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">score of 89</a> in our review — it can hold its own against flagship competitors from Apple and Samsung, and it has arguably a more fun design than the competition and remarkable cameras. The horizontal camera bar on its back is controversial, but striking nonetheless. It has a 6.4-inch 1080p OLED touchscreen that can reach up to 90Hz refresh rates, and it has an under-screen fingerprint sensor too (although we found this a bit too finicky). Google&#39;s new Tensor chip provides sold performance, and we liked the new Assistant and Android 12 perks such as the voice keyboard that will be popular with those who hate typing on smartphones.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As far as cameras go, you&#39;re getting a 50-megapixel main shooter along with a 12MP wide-angle lens and an 8MP selfie cam, all of which produce sharp, clean and bright photos. We also praised the Pixel 6&#39;s battery, which lasted about 20.5 hours during our testing. The Pixel 6 was already a competitively priced flagship smartphone, but this early Black Friday sale makes it even more tempting for Android users in need of an upgrade.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=retailevent2021&amp;subId3=Chromecast&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FChromecast-with-Google-TV%2F403830906" id="012fba8b204449eaaedef6b8a409b203" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Chromecast with Google TV at Walmart - $39</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/3Py19B" id="e3d3be877452403b87424f4c41b313eb" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub (2nd gen) at Best Buy - $50</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/15yAWd" id="26981347f37840768fac240e4cf1d067" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Nest Audio at Best Buy - $60</a><p>Along with that, a bunch of other Google gadgets have been discounted before the Black Friday frenzy begins.

The new location — at 59th Street between Park &amp; Lexington Avenues — will combine the Starbucks app&#39;s order ahead feature with Amazon&#39;s Just Walk Out technology. In fact, the store sounds a like a cross between the cafe and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-amazon-big-go-grocery-store-seattle-cashless.html">Amazon Go</a> store, which served as the launching pad for the e-commerce giant&#39;s cashierless tech experience.&nbsp;</p><p>It has a lounge area customers can enter by using the &quot;In-Store Code&quot; in the Amazon Shopping app, by scanning their credit cards or by scanning their palm registered with Amazon One on the terminals onsite. Once they&#39;re in, they&#39;ll find a small Amazon Go market containing a curated selection of customer favorites from both companies. Anything they take from the shelf will be added to their virtual carts, and they will be charged after they leave like in any other location that uses Amazon&#39;s Just Walk Out tech.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Over the past year-and-a-half, Amazon has expanded the availability of its cashierless technology. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-11-amazon-just-walk-out-cashier-less-newark.html">teamed up</a> with airport stores to implement the check-out free experience and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fresh-just-walk-out-technology-washington-114044465.html">opened</a> the first full-size Fresh grocery store with the technology in June. Amazon also added the technology to a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html">Whole Foods</a> locations and, more recently, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sainsburys-amazon-just-walk-out-shopping-store-151027993.html">licensed</a> it for use to UK supermarket chain Sainsbury&#39;s. This partnership with Starbucks is yet another step towards making Just Walk Out more ubiquitous than before.</p><p>Starbucks and Amazon are planning to open three joint stores in the coming year, including this one. The second location is planned for The New York Times Building located at 40th Street &amp; 8th Avenue. For now, New Yorkers can head to the first location at 59th Street to check out the concept.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8f8d4230-486c-11ec-bbed-513451108e8a" alt="Starbucks" data-uuid="0d44a77c-8b84-3292-ac91-4a30d1aaeb4b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Starbucks</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/starbucks-amazons-just-walk-out-nyc-concept-store-124526093.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">07d3c04a-878b-4579-a4e7-dad8a546323a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 12:45:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637241952</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T13:26:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9d81a9a0-4865-11ec-abee-2bd2fb26ae6b" width="1180" height="700" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9d81a9a0-4865-11ec-abee-2bd2fb26ae6b" width="1180" height="700" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Starbucks]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Starbucks]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Starbucks]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Repair iPhones and Macs yourself with Apple's self service program]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You’ll soon be able to repair parts of your iPhone yourself, without going to an approved service center. In a major shift in policy for Apple, the company is launching a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Self Service Repair program</a> that will let you repair products yourself using official Apple parts and tools.</p><p>It’ll launch in the US in early 2022 (rolling out later that year for other countries) and will initially give the resources to fix an iPhone 12 or iPhone 13. Apple says M1 Macs will follow after that.</p><p>So why the change? It could well be all this government pressure. The White House, the Federal Trade Commission and multiple states have backed right-to-repair measures that could have forced Apple’s hand.

It&#39;s great for the 15 percent of users who consume over 10 GB of data per month, but for the rest of us, we are subsidizing the bill for those users. You wouldn&#39;t pay $70 for an all you can eat buffet if you only wanted a salad, so why are we forced to choose all you can eat in wireless?&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In addition to the $100 annual plan, Boost has also launched a Carrier Crusher product with unlimited talk and text plus 15GB of data. It costs $20 a month, but customers will be billed annually. For those who prefer paying monthly, it now offers a $25 and a $15 plan with unlimited talk and text, as well as 5GB and 2G of data, respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>Dish <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dish-att-mobile-services-boost-ting-republic-wireless-t-mobile-151607721.html">struck a deal</a> with AT&amp;T back in July, paying the carrier at least $5 billion over 10 years to provide voice, data and messaging services to its Boost Mobile, Ting and Republic Wireless customers. Boost used to be Sprint&#39;s prepaid brand until the company had to spin it off as part of its merger with T-Mobile. Prior to its deal with AT&amp;T, Boost was entirely reliant on T-Mobile&#39;s network. However, the companies&#39; relationship soured when T-Mobile announced that it was shutting down the Sprint legacy network Boost is using on January 1st, 2022. Dish argued that the deadline doesn&#39;t give it enough time to migrate its customers, and T-Mobile ultimately agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-sprint-3g-cdma-shutdown-delay-151546831.html">move it</a> to March 31st next year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/boost-mobile-carrier-crusher-plans-att-110008725.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10fe51db-8b18-4c83-9f8c-be19075ccdd5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 11:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637233178</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T10:59:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6b6ef790-f380-11eb-bfff-fbb6d36830ac" width="6980" height="4656" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6b6ef790-f380-11eb-bfff-fbb6d36830ac" width="6980" height="4656" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Inside Creative House via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cropped image of happy girl using smartphone device while chilling at home]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cropped image of happy girl using smartphone device while chilling at home]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mattel arrives at the LA Motor Show with a life-size Barbie Extra EV]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What kid hasn&#39;t wished that their toy car was a full-sized road-going vehicle?

There was a long laundry list of complaints: the series is too dark, everyone is mean, everyone cries too much, the Klingon designs suck, it shouldn’t be set before the original series, Michael Burnham is an unlikeable main character. While some changes have been made to the show over the years to smooth these rough edges, the elevation of Michael Burnham to the captain’s chair for season four has made it clear that <em>Discovery</em> is still largely going to do its own thing, regardless of what the fandom thinks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the past, season four for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20trek/">Star Trek</a> series has always been a turning point, the moment when a show finally figures out what it wants to be. Season four of <em>The Next Generation</em> started with the riveting “The Best of Both Worlds,” and produced a number of classic episodes like “Family,” “Clues” and “The Drumhead.” <em>Deep Space Nine</em> added Worf to its crew in its fourth year, while <em>Voyager</em> got Seven of Nine. <em>Enterprise</em>’s final season is generally considered its best. So fans were curious to see if the pattern would continue in the Kurtzman era of Trek.</p><div id="804a30d349da4581a95a3fb61d0f6a31"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIPT9WC6Vsk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Things certainly looked promising at the end of last season. The crew of <em>Discovery</em> had jumped 900 years into the future, to a galaxy where dilithium fuel for space travel was in short supply and the Federation was in tatters thanks to an event known as “The Burn.” Burnham and the rest of the <em>Discovery</em> crew figured out the source of the disaster and solved the problem in last year’s finale, opening the doors to a show dedicated to rebuilding the Federation and its ideals. After three seasons of war, it finally looked like the <em>USS Discovery</em> could finally get down to Starfleet’s long-stated mandates of science and exploration.</p><p>Season four begins five months after the previous episode, with the Federation now in high gear reaching out to old members and allies. That’s where we join the <em>USS Discovery</em>, as Burnham and Cleveland Booker are attempting to give a shipment of dilithium to a species new to the Star Trek audience. The mission quickly goes awry, strongly reminiscent of the madcap opening of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek Into Darkness" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/NKRxLN"><em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em></a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3f880180-47ea-11ec-bf9f-1b663cf552d4" alt="Pictured: David Ajala as Book and Sonequa Martin Green as Burnham of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

They exhibit some of the excesses of modern Trek like an emphasis on frantic action and quippy dialogue — at least there’s less lens flare this time around. And everyone seems to be in a good mood, a contrast to when everyone was just worn down in the 23rd century by years of war and secret experiments.&nbsp;</p><p>The season opener is largely dedicated to showing off a new optimistic status quo, with Starfleet Academy being reestablished, Booker traveling to attend his nephew’s coming-of-age ritual and a new Federation president getting sworn in. It all seems rather staid, but Star Trek has always had its share of pomp and circumstance so it was actually a nice change of pace for the program. But things do go awry when the <em>Discovery</em> is tasked with rescuing a station crew and have to make a few hard choices, thus the title of the episode: “Kobayashi Maru.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/779510e0-47ea-11ec-acfe-7a455c2b4d2c" alt="Pictured: Mary Wiseman as Tilly of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

In the simulation, the cadets are faced with the choice of rescuing a ship stranded in enemy territory. To cross the border to rescue the craft is to risk war, but to preserve peace means to consign that crew to death. It’s been called a “no win” scenario,” and the Academy is interested in how a cadet reacts to it rather than the actual outcome. Kirk is known as the only person to have actually beaten it, because he reprogrammed the scenario; he cheated.</p><p>Like Kirk, Michael Burnham also doesn’t believe in the no-win scenario. She always does what she feels is best, and it’s made her crew unfailingly loyal to her over the past few seasons. But it’s earned her a share of detractors off-screen, because Burnham often disobeys orders and ignores good advice. She’s the rebel cop who plays by their own rules. Except this is Star Trek, a franchise about teamwork. Michael’s actions — and the fact that they always succeed — often undermine her superiors and even her own crewmates.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c20cf070-47ea-11ec-abf6-939c8320d357" alt="Pictured: Sonequa Martin Green as Burnham of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

But even then the show felt it needed some sort of conflict, bringing the Federation president along to question Michael’s judgment in front of her crew. I couldn’t help but be reminded of how before the show aired, the producers and writers were bragging about how they were going to break one of Gene Roddenberry’s key rules for the series: No inter-crew conflict. Watching that in action in this episode, however, was mildly uncomfortable and even a little embarrassing to see.</p><p>Not everything is rosy by the end of the adventure, but it’s still a better outcome than we’ve seen at the end of many Star Trek outings. But the new “happy” status quo is thrown out the door by an anomaly at the end of the episode. As seen in previews, this anomaly will be an ongoing concern for the <em>USS Discovery</em> and the entire Federation — not just as a threat to life, but as a threat to the Federation’s efforts to pull itself back together.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3d2256b0-47eb-11ec-9b97-075806a2a5c6" alt="Pictured: Emily Coutts as Lt.

Fans who love “planet of the week” adventures and were hoping for the show to embrace that format will come away disappointed for now. However, while episodes one and two are involved in setup for the ongoing anomaly plot line, episodes three and four still make room for some vaguely one-shot adventures, albeit ones designed to further character development.</p><p>But while <em>Discovery</em> doesn’t seem all that interested in changing how it does things, the environment around it has changed. It’s no longer the only Star Trek show on TV, thanks to the premieres of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20trek%3A%20picard/"><em>Picard</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20trek%3A%20lower%20decks/"><em>Lower Decks</em></a> in 2020, last month’s kid-oriented <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-first-episode-lost-and-found-070033462.html"><em>Prodigy</em></a> and the debut of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-paramount-plus-020913184.html"><em>Strange New Worlds</em></a> next year. All of these shows tackle the Star Trek universe in their own way, and are not required viewing to understand what’s happening in other shows (though there are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-star-trek-picard-technology-evolution.html">some references to Picard</a> in the first episodes of <em>Discovery</em>). Viewers can choose the Trek that suits them best, removing the pressure from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Discovery" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/EaZn7n"><em>Discovery</em></a> to be all things to all fans and making it even easier to just do its own thing.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-season-four-episode-one-premiere-080055200.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b5b91bc3-9dd4-4e77-acf4-cdbb816c95ea</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 08:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637188853</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T22:41:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/26b53f80-47e8-11ec-bab3-439d8be6ae78" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/26b53f80-47e8-11ec-bab3-439d8be6ae78" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pictured: Sonequa Martin Green as Burnham of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

SharePlay lets you watch movies and shows or listen to music with friends on a FaceTime call. You can also send whatever you&#39;re watching on the iPhone to an Apple TV.&nbsp;</p><p>While iOS 15.1.1 is a fairly minor update — unless you&#39;ve been having major issues with dropped calls on your phone — iOS 15.2 is expected to bring some more significant features. As <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/16/ios-15-2-beta-3-features/"><em>MacRumors</em></a> has reported, the upcoming software will add playlist search to the Apple Music app and the capability to bulk rename tags in the Reminders app. It will also <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/16/ios-15-2-beta-3-features/">show</a> when a game is from Apple Arcade if you search for it and will tweak the Macro mode toggle.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>iOS 15.2 is still in beta testing, but you can now get iOS 15.1.1 by going to Software Update under General in the Settings app.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ios-update-iphone-12-13-fixes-dropped-call-bug-063908906.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">91f94785-2da5-4ca0-b5c7-12f2669961ab</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 06:39:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637217611</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T06:40:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1a7e8ad0-4835-11ec-bdf6-ae77fc8b899b" width="3000" height="1658" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1a7e8ad0-4835-11ec-bdf6-ae77fc8b899b" width="3000" height="1658" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 12]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Windjammers 2' is coming to Xbox Game Pass]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Three years after its initial announcement, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-windjammers-2-demo-impressions-gamescom.html"><em><ins>Windjammers 2</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>doesn’t have a release date yet, but the good news is it’s <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/17/windjammers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-one-and-xbox-game-pass/">coming to Xbox Game Pass</a>. Developer Dotemu shared that tidbit of new information in a trailer it posted on Wednesday. When it finally launches, <em>Windjammers 2 </em>will be available on Game Pass for both PC and Xbox, and it will support online crossplay across all Xbox and PC versions of the title. That means Steam and Game Pass users will have the chance to play against one another.</p><div id="28286babbbe34dedb964c594dc7aef6b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryhRLLBwzQU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The trailer also offers a look at the two final characters that will make up the game’s initial 12-person roster. There’s Jodi Costa, who fans will recognize from the 1994 original, and newcomer Sammy Ho. Both have their own set of special moves you’ll need to master to make the most of their capabilities. In addition to PC and Xbox, Dotemu will release <em>Windjammers 2 on</em> Nintendo Switch, Google Stadia, PlayStation 4 and PS5.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windjammers-2-xbox-game-pass-224524389.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">87d01bfc-ae81-4f97-ac19-32e8855c97f2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 22:45:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637187633</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T06:58:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d3a2f560-47f3-11ec-beff-4d76825f4c00" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d3a2f560-47f3-11ec-beff-4d76825f4c00" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dotemu]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windjammers 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windjammers 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kia's electric SUV concept includes a sprawling 27-inch display]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hyundai&#39;s LA Auto Show concepts include more than just a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-ioniq-seven-concept-self-driving-ev-213020775.html">lounge on wheels</a>. As <em>Autoblog</em><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/11/17/kia-concept-ev9-ev-electric-suv-la-auto-show-reveal/">notes</a>, the related Kia brand has <a href="https://www.kiamedia.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/18240/the-kia-concept-ev9-kias-all-electric-suv-concept-takes-center-stage-at-automobility-la">unveiled</a> the Concept EV9 as a peek at the possible &quot;next model&quot; in its electric vehicle lineup. The angular design language is a centerpiece, but the real highlight may be technology that, in some cases, eclipses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kia-officially-debuts-the-ev-6-awd-electric-crossover-080006032.html">the EV6</a>. For one, the cockpit is dominated by a single 27-inch display that covers both driver and passenger needs — it&#39;s not as huge as the Hyperscreen in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-review-video-150001883.html">Mercedes EQS</a>, but it&#39;s more expansive than the EV6&#39;s dual 12-inch panels.</p><p>You can also expect solid performance with up to 300 miles of range and 350kW charging that brings the Concept EV9 from a 10 percent charge to 80 percent in 30 minutes. The Concept EV9 won&#39;t outlast a Tesla Model Y, then, but it might deliver shorter pit stops.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c8f4d8f0-47f2-11ec-ab3e-2d990e19859e" alt="Kia Concept EV9 electric SUV interior" data-uuid="b5fb6e74-b6d6-3bc4-8bc5-b154a826f9ed"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kia</div></figure><p>There are some obvious concept car touches. Apart from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-redesign-interior-221606865.html">yoke-like</a> wheel, the EV9 can turn into a social hub when it&#39;s stationary. A Pause mode turns the second row into a table and swings the front row to face the back, while Enjoy Mode pivots the third row and opens the tailgate for parties and marvelling at nature. You can also expect the obligatory eco-friendly materials like recycled fishnets (flooring), reused plastic bottles (seats) and a vegan leather interior.</p><p>Kia hasn&#39;t said how closely this might resemble a production EV9, although we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the company cuts the rotating seats, yoke and giant 22-inch wheels (among other frills) for any real-world model. The biggest question may be price. Kia sold its First Edition EV6 for $58,500, but that was a limited, maxed-out version. We&#39;d expect Kia to offer more aggressive prices if there is a shipping EV9, although the road-ready machine could easily cost more than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-24-2019-kia-niro-ev-review.html">Niro EV</a>.</p><div id="6628a569ec1b4731860aa4f941787262"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1klApgPyB4?start=740" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kia-concept-ev9-electric-suv-221504011.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9404f295-3d4f-44f8-8108-1e055eb430b0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 22:15:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637256710</ingested><modified>2021-11-18T17:32:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b1462bf0-47ed-11ec-b5ed-a2a2cb504771" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b1462bf0-47ed-11ec-b5ed-a2a2cb504771" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kia Concept EV9 electric SUV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Kia Concept EV9 electric SUV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Streamlabs drops 'OBS' from its app name after plagiarism complaints]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-accused-of-copying-lightstream-obs-140742760.html">accusations of plagiarism and copycat naming schemes</a>, <a href="https://streamlabs.com/">Streamlabs</a> has announced that it&#39;s removing &quot;OBS&quot; from the name of its popular livestreaming app. At first glance, the move is a direct response to the developers behind <a href="https://obsproject.com/">Open Broadcasting Software</a> (OBS), who claimed that Streamlabs used their naming scheme against their wishes. The fast response, though, is more directly tied to criticism from top streamers like Pokimane and Hasanabi, who threatened to stop using Streamlabs&#39;s software if it didn&#39;t address the copycat concerns.&nbsp;</p><div id="9a2e9ac55805462aa79c1cc002f8d1db"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/00sjHsmntF">pic.twitter.com/00sjHsmntF</a></p>— Streamlabs (@streamlabs) <a href="https://twitter.com/streamlabs/status/1461044715634135046?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Streamlab&#39;s apology comes across as defensive, since it&#39;s arguing that its software is also open source like OBS, one of the first tools built specifically for livestreamers. Streamlab&#39;s app, which has been praised for being well-designed and feature-rich, is also based on a fork of OBS. Despite those shared beginnings, though, Streamlabs has always been a separate project. It also offers premium services on top of its free core app, so you could argue that Streamlabs was partially fueling its business based on OBS&#39;s popularity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-drops-obs-name-livestreaming-215852461.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0b3821f2-af48-4960-bdb3-e52e46ad5a0a</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 21:58:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637186334</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T21:59:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1788b820-47ed-11ec-ba7f-4abb4506fe6d" width="5357" height="3514" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1788b820-47ed-11ec-ba7f-4abb4506fe6d" width="5357" height="3514" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 11: In this illustration photo logo of Streamlabs is displayed on a smartphone and a pc screen in Ankara, Turkey on May 11, 2021.
