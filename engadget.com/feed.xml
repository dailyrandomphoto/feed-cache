It uses a streamlined, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qblSdDZMmi0">AI-powered toolset</a> to remove background noise, add virtual effects, auto-frame shots and more. Now, Logitech has <a href="https://blog.logitech.com/2021/11/02/logitech-g-hub-nvidia-broadcast-integration-enters-open-beta/">announced</a> that it&#39;s incorporating some of those features directly into certain headsets and Blue microphones via a new beta, with no need to run any NVIDIA apps.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to a partnership between Logitech and NVIDIA, some of the Broadcast tools will be available through the G Hub drivers for the following products: Logitech G733 Gaming Headset, Logitech PRO X Gaming Headset, Logitech PRO X Wireless Gaming Headset, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-blue-yeti-x-microphone-streaming-podcasting-recording.html">Blue Yeti X Microphone</a>, Blue Yeti Classic Microphone and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-28-blue-yeti-nano-usb-microphone.html">Blue Yeti Nano</a> Microphone.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d3b7b858379745a39694459a697df2dd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s the full list of compatible Logitech G and <a href="https://twitter.com/BlueMicrophones?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BlueMicrophones</a> devices: <br><br>G733 Gaming Headset <br>PRO X Gaming Headset<br>PRO X Wireless Gaming Headset<br>Yeti X Microphone<br>Yeti Classic Microphone<br>Yeti Nano Microphone</p>— Logitech G (@LogitechG) <a href="https://twitter.com/LogitechG/status/1455429903663255555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The drivers will make it possible for users to eliminate unwanted background noises and/or echo in a single click and clean up their mic signal. &quot;You can even test your mic signal to find the perfect settings for your set up,&quot; Logitech wrote. NVIDIA previously showed that it was possible to completely remove the sound of a hair dryer running in the background from your mic, so it&#39;s not just some minor noise reduction. It can also remove noise on the listeners end, like someone&#39;s clattering keyboard.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature is now available to everyone via an open beta with the latest version of Logitech G Hub. You can also, of course, run NVIDIA Broadcast as a separate app that works with all of Logitech&#39;s audio products (or any other audio products, for that matter). The feature is supported on GeForce RTX 2060 and up GPUs, along with Quadro RTX 3000 and Titan RTX or higher.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-broadcast-adds-direct-logitech-headset-and-blue-microphone-support-140614960.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5b27cd27-918f-4dfd-9ae8-e7608a3ab636</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 14:06:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635861976</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T14:06:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/eca3ff10-3bdb-11ec-bf12-3701b3edcbb4" width="1600" height="871" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/eca3ff10-3bdb-11ec-bf12-3701b3edcbb4" width="1600" height="871" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast adds direct Logitech headset and Blue microphone support]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA Broadcast adds direct Logitech headset and Blue microphone support]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The McPlant tastes just like any McDonald's burger]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>McDonald’s first plant-based burger (ignoring the veggie “burgers” that have come before it) finally goes on limited sale in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mc-donalds-trial-run-us-mcplant-164512755.html">US later this week</a>.</p><p>Following a brief trial in Canada in 2019, the McPlant has been on a wider tour of McDonald’s franchises in Europe. Ahead of its debut next week, I decided to try out the McPlant here in the UK, where it’s been available in selected restaurants for over a month. The TLDR review is that it tastes like... a McDonald’s burger.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I’ve had better (and worse) burgers, both plant and animal-based, but the launch itself is a major deal for the future of plant-based burgers in general. Whether you eat there or not, you can’t avoid the fact that this is the world’s biggest fast-food chain attempting a burger that tastes of meat — without using any meat.</p><p>McDonald’s is a little late to the plant-based patty party. In 2019, its rival Burger King started selling its own Impossible Whopper, recruiting Impossible Foods to help create a meat-free patty for its iconic menu item.</p><p>The launch wasn’t without issues though. Depending on location, the Impossible Whopper launched at roughly $1-2 dollars more than the beef-based original. (The chain eventually cut prices, due to slowing sales according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-22/burger-king-cuts-impossible-whopper-price-as-sales-taper-off?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em><ins>Bloomberg</ins></em></a>.)</p><p>Then there was the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-50486664">class-action lawsuit</a>, because the Impossible Whopper, while entirely plant-based, was being cooked on the same surfaces as meat and dairy products. A vegan customer said that ads that said &quot;100% Whopper, 0% Beef&quot;  were misleading. A Florida judge eventually dismissed the case, but not before it made headlines, and ensured that, from then on, Burger King stipulated that its plant-based Whopper was prepared on surfaces that came into contact with meat and dairy items, meaning that it was subsequently not vegan.</p><p>McDonald’s takes a similar approach on its corporate site, saying that the McPlant will be “cooked on the same grill as meat-based products and eggs“. In even more certain terms, the McPlant features American cheese and mayonnaise, which make it far from vegan-friendly.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e03c39d0-3bdc-11ec-b74f-6f2c7efcc7d5" style="height:810;width:1440;" alt="McDonald&#39;s McPlant plant-based burger " data-uuid="c83b136f-3449-37ae-823a-75dbcb7e40ce"><figcaption>The US McPlant comes with &quot;real&quot; American cheese.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">McDonald&#39;s</div></figure><p>However, McDonald’s UK and Ireland took three years to develop its own take on the McPlant, and it ticks the vegan box. Alongside the co-developed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mcdonalds-plant-based-burger-meatless-mcplant-171734231.html">Beyond Meat patty</a>, this particular McPlant comes in a vegan sesame bun, uses a pea-protein-based ‘cheese’ slice and a new vegan sauce that tastes somewhere between mayonnaise and the Golden Arches’ own burger sauce. (I really wish they’d given the sauce some kind of name, just to make it less... mysterious.) I think it&#39;s meant to be a mayonnaise substitute.</p><p>The new menu item has also been given the Vegetarian Society’s vegan accreditation, because on top of those recipe changes, here in the UK it is cooked and prepared separately to non-vegan products. For now, the US McPlant is neither vegan nor vegetarian and will come with a slice of American cheese and mayonnaise. The burger is also cooked on the same grill as meat - and egg-based products.</p><p>But back to my McPlant. With lettuce, tomato, pickles and that faux cheese slice, the UK version of the McPlant is more substantial than a standard McDonald’s cheeseburger.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e0567890-3bdc-11ec-8eef-18dd2a199202" style="height:1043;width:1600;" alt="McPlant plant-based burger from McDonald&#39;s" data-uuid="3448fb2d-4fee-386a-bcaf-583a99922ac3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p>From what I’ve been told, the composition and the Beyond Meat patty remain the same in the McDonald’s USA version. Like other high-end plant-based burgers given the mainstream treatment, it tastes meaty and the — I hate this word — mouthfeel tells my brain that I’m chewing on a McDonald’s burger.</p><p>The good thing about using plant-based meat substitutes in a burger is that the patty is just half the story. How it’s cooked, the toppings, the seasoning and the sauce add an awful lot (often more) to the flavors and textures.</p><p>Each bite is literally a cross-section of the entire burger, and so even if you think rival plant-based patties (like Impossible Foods’) are better than Beyond’s, once it’s cooked, stacked and in your hands, for most of us, a patty that’s marginally tastier is irrelevant.</p><p>Despite that, the burger itself does taste like a McDonald’s beef hamburger. So that’s a success. (I’m less sold on the fake cheese slice, but the majority of vegan cheese options taste terrible too, so not sure I can blame McDonald’s entirely here.)</p><p>The economies of scale are why the McPlant matters. Depending on how the US trial at eight restaurants fares, McDonald’s patrons might be willing to swap out their beef-based burger for a McPlant — if it tastes the part — and that could have a tangible effect on how much meat is both consumed by the public — and how much is farmed.</p><p>Halfway through eating the McPlant, I realized that it reminded me of a Burger King Whopper. (I can’t wait to read the comments after this.)&nbsp;</p><p>But I’m a Big Mac man, myself. Maybe a Big MacPlant is next?</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-mc-plant-tastes-just-like-any-mc-donalds-burger-135059673.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">794d6dab-cd62-4cb4-84bf-4c8c923a6b8c</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 13:50:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635859733</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T13:28:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4c755860-3bde-11ec-9dff-3700c5175eed" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4c755860-3bde-11ec-9dff-3700c5175eed" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[McPlant]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[McPlant]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's 512GB Mac Mini M1 returns to a record low of $750 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While we did not get an updated Mac Mini this year, the existing M1 desktop remains a good option if you want a compact machine with one of Apple&#39;s latest chips.

As the <em>AP</em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-software-d3e2107435f432fd9b36ba14898166a0">noted</a>, The <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2021/RCLRPT-21V846-7836.PDF">new recall</a> covers 11,704 Tesla EVs from 2017 or newer (including the Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X) that were prone to &quot;false-positive braking&quot; after a buggy Full Self-Driving beta update from October 23rd led to a communications breakdown between two chips. The company fixed the issue on October 25th. The day before, it also cancelled the flawed update and disabled emergency braking on cars still using that beta release.</p><p>There were no reports of crashes or injuries, Tesla said. The automaker decided to issue a recall on October 26th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The recall may have been meant to prevent conflicts with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The agency sent a letter to Tesla on October 12th asking why it didn&#39;t issue a recall when it fixed an Autopilot software issue that reportedly led to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-ordered-hand-over-autopilot-data-nhtsa-073520497.html">collisions with emergency vehicles</a>. Tesla knows car manufacturers are required to issue recalls for any safety issues, the NHTSA said. It&#39;s not clear how Tesla responded to that inquiry before a November 1st deadline, but the company might now be in the habit of issuing recalls for software-related safety problems.</p><p>The notice highlights the changing nature of recalls. While recalls for hardware-only flaws haven&#39;t changed much (just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-restarts-production-of-bolt-ev-batteries-following-model-wide-recall-194412215.html">ask Chevy and LG</a>), software-related issues are another matter. Now that more and more cars accept over-the-air updates, it&#39;s possible for companies like Tesla to issue recalls for bugs they&#39;ve already fixed. Brands may have to make it particularly clear when a recall demands real-world service, as that might not always be clear going forward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-braking-recall-software-glitch-132442476.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">88b834ba-610f-482c-81d7-2c21421ae513</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 13:24:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635859485</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T13:24:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/001e7880-317e-11ec-bdbb-3ca0a1aed4bd" width="4000" height="2666" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/001e7880-317e-11ec-bdbb-3ca0a1aed4bd" width="4000" height="2666" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barcroft Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YANTAI, CHINA - OCTOBER 17, 2021 - A Tesla Model 3 is displayed at the Tesla Experience store in Joy City, Yantai, East China's Shandong Province, Oct 17, 2021.

The new homepage has an easy way to jump back into your last open tab, and it now contains your most recently saved bookmarks.</p><p>There&#39;s no need to go to the bookmarks menu or access your browsing history anymore, if you just want to access the last bookmarks you&#39;ve saved or viewed. If you have a Firefox account and also use the browser on desktop, your most recently saved bookmarks on desktop will also be added to the mobile homepage. Further, you can quickly access all your bookmarks by clicking Show All.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new homepage for Android also has the ability to group search queries by topic. Say, you&#39;re looking up things for an upcoming vacation — the browser now groups and lists the results you access instead of opening them in separate tabs. To keep things clean, those groups of information will only be available within 14 days. Speaking of keeping things clutter-free, the new Firefox will now mark tabs as &quot;inactive&quot; if you haven&#39;t visited them within the last 14 days. You can still go back to them after that, but they&#39;ll no longer clutter your view.

Online radicalization has seen many of the world’s political systems spin out of control to the point of uselessness. Climate change is a problem facing literally all of us that few in power seem interested in addressing. And our economic situation seems to be predicated on everyone buying lots of stuff all the time, despite the fact that most of the cost of living is swallowed up by housing. It’s<em> a lot</em>, and things can feel generally very bleak right now.</p><p>But, as the proverb says, it is always better to light a candle than it is to curse the darkness, so we’ve brought some matches. Today is a good time to try and make a positive impact in the world by backing organizations that can make the world a little better for all of us. That includes helping to better educate future generations, making life easier for kids who need serious medical care, or are in poverty, as well as addressing the climate crisis. This could never be an exhaustive list of good causes to donate to, but we’ve tried to pick out charities and non-profits whose general aims are probably already supported by Engadget readers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Able Gamers</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c8a6d760-2dc4-11ec-9f7e-432c54b1c01c" alt="Tech Charities for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="81057cbc-5c71-303f-9db6-754893db4af5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Able Gamers</div></figure><p><em>Able Gamers is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, EIN: 30-0533750.

The fourth-generation device is smaller than the previous and it doesn&#39;t require a bridge thanks to its WiFi connectivity. Like most smart home devices, you&#39;ll follow a few setup videos in the companion mobile app to set the lock up, and during that process you&#39;ll have to turn on two-factor authentication. It&#39;s a necessary step and we were glad to see it as that extra layer of security is important for all connected devices — especially those that lock and unlock your home. And on top of that, the WiFi smart lock also has Bluetooth encryption plus AES 128-bit and TLS encryption.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After setting it up, August&#39;s device can be controlled from its companion app, allowing you to remotely lock and unlock your door. This lets you easily let friends and family members in when you&#39;re not home, and its Auto-Lock feature can detect when you&#39;ve shut the door and automatically secure it. And your old-school keys aren&#39;t suddenly useless either — you can still use them with the WiFi smart lock installed, so if you ever forget to replace the lock&#39;s dual CR123 batteries, you can still get into your home.

Now the company is expanding further to give you literally everything you might need for a full meal, with all of the dishes cooked directly from on its grills. <a href="https://provisions.traeger.com/">Traeger Provisions</a> is a HelloFresh-like meal kit that includes the meat, sides, rubs, sauces and more needed for a complete backyard feast that will feed crowds small and large.</p><p>At launch, the meat options are Wagyu beef brisket, Poulet Rouge chicken and Berkshire St. Louis pork ribs. Traeger says portion sizes for all three will accommodate 4-8 people, depending on the protein. For the brisket, the company also offers an option for 14-16 people (half brisket vs. whole brisket). With the smaller packages, you get the choice of two sides and four come with the big brisket feast. Right now, the options include three-cheese mac and cheese, bourbon baked beans with bacon, collard greens with bacon and cornbread with spiced brown sugar. All of the side dishes come in “Traeger-ready” foil pans, so they’re good to go on the grill quickly. Prices range from $150 to $180 for the smaller packages, while the larger whole brisket box is $250. Shipping is an additional $10.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1d8a1a60-3b82-11ec-9f7d-59bb974b5a0b" alt="Traeger Provisions" data-uuid="f2789456-d44e-3e63-ae4c-7cccdcb9a9a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Traeger is also preparing three holiday options for Thanksgiving. These Provisions boxes are more expensive at $220-$250, but the Heritage black turkey, naked turkey breast and rolled and trussed porchetta options will feed 8-10 people according to Traeger. They come with three side dishes instead of two and there are seasonal options like green bean casserole or apricot and bacon stuffing. The two turkey packages can also be upsized for 18-20 people for another $100.</p><p>As you might expect, all of this ships frozen and packed with dry ice. To start, Traeger is shipping the boxes to Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming and Utah. Since the meat and sides will be solid when they arrive, you’ll need to add a few days into your meal planning timeline, and the company offers detailed guidance on how to do exactly that as part of its cooking directions.</p><p>In addition to advice on the thawing process, Traeger includes all of the steps to prep the meat for the grill. That includes any trimming or seasoning that needs to be completed beforehand. The printed directions also guide you through the entire cook, with details on when to wrap (if necessary) and when to put the sides on the grill. It’s basically a paper-based version of Traeger’s app that offers step-by-step instructions with tons of recipes. If you need additional help, the directions have QR codes for videos and more info on tricky steps like trimming a brisket. There’s also guidance for how to prepare and cook the sides, including cooking bacon to mix in or topping a dish with bread crumbs before putting it on the grill. Lastly, supplies like rubs, sauces, pickled veggies, “pitmaster snacks,” gloves and butcher paper are all included. You literally just have to provide the grill and a bag of pellets.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1d95b321-3b82-11ec-99d7-1bbbdaaeb9a4" alt="Traeger Provisions" data-uuid="c929b350-8af6-3369-9899-f5f3a741fcfb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>I tested out Traeger Provisions with a Wagyu beef brisket Smokehouse Box. I selected the smaller size for 7-8 people, which included a six-pound Brisket, three-cheese mac and cheese, bourbon baked beans with bacon and all of the aforementioned accoutrements. Even though I have experience with barbecue and Traeger’s recipes for its grills, I followed the Provisions directions closely, and the guidance was clear and easy for cooking on the Ironwood 650. I only deviated in an attempt to brown the breadcrumbs on the mac in the oven and popped the beans in there to keep them warm. Cooking steps helped with timing too, which can be difficult when you’re trying to have meat and sides all ready at the same time.</p><p>Obviously, the brisket was the star of the show. Mine was slightly dry as I have a tendency to over trim the extra fat, but that’s a me problem and not an issue with Traeger’s culinary tips. Still, the Wagyu beef was perfectly marbled so the fatty cuts were more forgiving to my butchering mistakes. Those remained quite moist and very tasty. Consensus among my family was that the mac and cheese was also a winner, with the herby, garlicky thick sauce serving as a great complement to the brisket. The baked beans we didn’t care for, but that’s likely because they were more what I’d call “barbeque beans” with a thinner sauce than the thick, molasses-tinged dish we’re used to in the Carolinas. I also enjoyed the “pitmaster snacks,” which included a smoked nut mix and smoked beef jerky.</p><p>The directions helped me time everything perfectly so we weren’t waiting on one thing to finish while the rest got cold. I think the portions are also accurately calculated. Eight servings would’ve been stretching it, but I could have easily gotten six or seven out of the half brisket box. The ribs option also seems okay in terms of portions, but the Poulet Rouge chicken might not. Four half chickens for 6-8 people seems like a stretch unless these are massively huge birds.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1d8a4170-3b82-11ec-970f-c7c82d8bde8f" alt="Traeger Provisions" data-uuid="c518318f-c0be-3fc4-98fc-897f405349d5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>So, who are these boxes for?  Most backyard cooks with some experience will likely have their go-to butcher or grocery store for proteins. They probably also have tricks for easy sides so they can focus on the meats. At $150, you’re definitely paying for convenience, in addition to high-quality beef, pork or poultry.</p><p>The ability to have everything you need in one box with detailed directions on how to prepare it can take some of the stress out of party planning. There is some lead time required though, so you can’t grab one of these on Tuesday for a cookout on Saturday. At the end of the day though, I don’t think that price is astronomical based on what Traeger is offering. Is it something you’ll do a lot? No. Will it come in handy in certain circumstances? Absolutely. I can see plenty of people being interested in having most of their Thanksgiving meal planning done with a few clicks.</p><p>I can also see Traeger Provisions serving as a great gift for new grill owners. Sure, it’s a considerable amount to spend on someone, but it would definitely help a novice get their feet wet with some step-by-step oversight. Plus, they might not have all the supplies they need yet — little things like butcher paper and gloves, for example.</p><p>Traeger is now taking orders for its Provisions boxes that will be delivered between November 10th and 14th. If you’re considering one of those Thanksgiving packages, you’ll need to order by November 14th to get it in time. Just remember: Traeger Provisions is only delivering to select states at this time.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="484d0070-87f1-493d-ba2b-79963c895edb"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/traeger-provisions-review-120027663.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d525cb7-8f4d-44b7-95de-46fc365ffc75</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 12:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635855499</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T12:18:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddb9eea0-3b82-11ec-adba-d290ab726826" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddb9eea0-3b82-11ec-adba-d290ab726826" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Traeger Provisions]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Traeger Provisions]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: '5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized disc]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blu-rays are so done.

The new technique has sped this process up substantially, to around 230 KB per second. And, yes, that sounds pretty slow, but it could provide a way to backup data, essentially forever.

Even GM has been offering it for years in its cars with OnStar and recently introduced crash detection to smartphones via the OnStar Guardian app.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-i-phone-could-soon-detect-a-car-crash-and-dial-911-automatically-134124164.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3>The biggest news stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sega-microsoft-super-game-partnership-204720764.html"><ins>Sega is making a &#39;Super Game&#39; with Microsoft</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-enabling-a-new-generation-of-touchy-feely-robots-120016974.html"><ins>Facebook is enabling a new generation of touchy-feely robots</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-in-the-facebook-papers-and-what-it-means-for-the-company-194502237.html"><ins>What&#39;s in the Facebook Papers and what it means for the company</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/googles-nest-devices-are-on-sale-on-best-buy-ahead-of-black-friday-091042291.html"><ins>Google&#39;s Nest devices are on sale at Best Buy ahead of Black Friday</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-confirms-pixel-6-pro-display-flickering-issue-will-be-fixed-next-month-122533947.html"><ins>Google confirms Pixel 6 Pro display flickering issue will be fixed next month</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-project-kuiper-test-2022-190551476.html"><ins>Amazon&#39;s Project Kuiper will launch two prototype satellites by the end of 2022</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-new-air-pods-pro-with-magsafe-are-down-to-190-at-best-buy-121010360.html"><ins>Apple&#39;s new AirPods Pro with Magsafe are down to $190 at Best Buy</ins></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-template-5-d-storage-could-fit-500-tb-on-a-cd-sized-disc-113702417.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8372c3e5-1971-43c7-9b64-9e4eb89c961c</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 11:37:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635855323</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T12:15:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/530e3000-3af5-11ec-b79d-a42610881822" width="1936" height="1243" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/530e3000-3af5-11ec-b79d-a42610881822" width="1936" height="1243" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Optica]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized glass disc]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized glass disc]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Elon Musk says Hertz hasn’t actually ordered 100,000 Tesla EVs yet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, a <a href="https://ir.hertz.com/2021-10-25-Hertz-Invests-in-Largest-Electric-Vehicle-Rental-Fleet-and-Partners-with-Seven-Time-Super-Bowl-Champion-Tom-Brady-to-Headline-New-Campaign">press release</a> from Hertz indicated that the rental company had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html">placed an order</a> for 100,000 Tesla Model 3s for its rental fleet. Late yesterday, however, Elon Musk tweeted that the order is far from firm, saying that &quot;no contract has been signed yet,&quot; <a href="https://gizmodo.com/elon-musk-says-tesla-hasnt-signed-a-contract-with-hertz-1847979941"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> has reported.</p><p>Hertz&#39;s announcement stated that it made &quot;a significant investment to offer the largest EV rental fleet in North America...

The phrase &quot;an initial order of 100,000 Tesla&#39;s by the end of 2022&quot; could be taken to mean that the order itself and not the vehicle deliveries will happen at the end of 2022. Tesla itself never responded to the initial news.&nbsp;</p><p>Musk&#39;s tweet came in reply to Twitter user &quot;Tesla Silicon Valley Club,&quot; which was thanking him for Tesla&#39;s recent stock price rise.

There, you&#39;ll find streams of furry/feathered creatures from zoos, conservation habitats and private owners that were previously spread across categories like Travel &amp; Outdoors, Music and Pools, and even ASMR.&nbsp;</p><p>The new space sounds like a perfect antidote other, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamers-are-taking-a-day-off-next-week-to-protest-hate-raids-065515266.html">more stressful</a> Twitch offerings. Some sample streams include an otter enclosure, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/wolfconservationcenter">wolf den</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hoothouselivestream">barn owl</a> breeding habitat and, of course, numerous <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/technicallyoffbeat">kitties</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/themuttmansion">doggos</a>, ducks and bunnies. On top of the live channels, you can see numerous videos and short highlight clips, since the otters or owls might be sleeping on the livestream — though even that can be adorable.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some of the streams are even interactive, in that you can feed ducks or change turtle habitat lighting by donating Twitch&#39;s Bits currency. If you&#39;re okay something more direct, Twitch also launched some emotes available across channels that can also be unlocked with Bits. All of this could help get resources to conservation and other organizations that need it — it seems a fair trade for some calming, adorable and life-affirming content.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-creates-a-new-category-for-all-its-very-good-animal-livestreams-094054882.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e26fb41-cc24-48e0-ad25-fe02280f761f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 09:40:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635844772</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T09:19:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cc1d6d50-3bb6-11ec-addb-565cc660fcc1" width="1306" height="700" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cc1d6d50-3bb6-11ec-addb-565cc660fcc1" width="1306" height="700" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitch]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitch creates a new category for all its Very Good animal livestreams]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitch creates a new category for all its Very Good animal livestreams]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Miso Robotics made its Flippy kitchen robot faster and even more autonomous]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2020, Miso Robotics <a href="https://www.engadget.com/your-next-white-castle-slider-could-be-cooked-by-a-robot-090012343.html">teamed up</a> with White Castle to pilot a kitchen robot that can cook sliders called Flippy in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/flippy-robot-white-castle-expansion-090002507.html">select locations</a>. Now, thanks to data and employee feedback gathered from the pilot, Miso was able to create a new version of the machine called Flippy 2, which works faster and doesn&#39;t need human intervention. Apparently, one of the main things <a href="https://www.engadget.com/misos-latest-ai-powered-app-can-monitor-burger-and-steak-cooking-times-090035547.html">Miso</a> learned from the pilot was that human assistance was still needed on both sides during operation. Since basket management wasn&#39;t automated, human employees would still need to help load the uncooked product and unload the cooked food in the holding area.&nbsp;</p><p>Miso has designed an &quot;AutoBin&quot; system for the Flippy 2 that solves that problem, specifically for lower volume and specialty foods like onion rings and chicken tenders. The machine&#39;s AI vision can automatically identify the ingredients it&#39;s working with, place them in the right fry basket and then place the cooked food in the holding area. The company says the closed-loop system it creates can increase the kitchen&#39;s throughput by around 60 baskets per hour.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to that upgrade, Flippy 2 also takes up less space than its predecessor. It doesn&#39;t take up as much of the kitchen aisle, is a bit shorter and has fewer overall surfaces that need to be cleaned. After its pilot with White Castle, Miso <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-smarter-more-capable-flippy-robot-knows-how-to-fry-19-things-090044466.html">upgraded</a> the original Flippy with more features, including the ability to adjust the queue to ensure that everything in an order finishes cooking at the same time. However, basket management hasn&#39;t been an automated process until now.</p><p>Mike Bell, CEO of Miso Robotics, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Flippy 2 takes up less space in the kitchen and increases production exponentially with its new basket filling, emptying and returning capabilities. Since Flippy’s inception, our goal has always been to provide a customizable solution that can function harmoniously with any kitchen and without disruption. Flippy 2 has more than 120 configurations built into its technology and is the only robotic fry station currently being produced at scale&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/miso-robotics-flippy-2-090049027.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2a5f9fe9-4eba-495e-88c1-7e08694e66a1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 09:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635856497</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T12:35:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/152a4b30-3bb7-11ec-bbff-2ba4cea22f28" width="1600" height="1063" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/152a4b30-3bb7-11ec-bbff-2ba4cea22f28" width="1600" height="1063" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Miso Robotics]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Flippy 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Flippy 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Squid Game' cryptocurrency collapses in a $3 million scam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A cryptocurrency inspired by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-142-million-households-squid-game-070044407.html"><em>Squid Game</em></a> successfully enticed enough investors to see its value soar to over $2,800... before its creators cashed out and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/nov/01/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scam-fears-investors">vanished</a>. The cryptocurrency called $SQUID, which wasn&#39;t officially sanctioned by Netflix, launched in late October and rose up to 310,000 percent in value within just a few days. It was sold supposedly as a way to play an upcoming online game based on the South Korean series, in which people buried in debt are forced to play a deadly game.&nbsp;</p><p>At 5:40AM on Monday morning, however, the coin&#39;s value plummeted to $0, its website disappeared (you can view an <a href="https://archive.md/nF8hP">archive</a> here) and its Twitter account got <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/GoGoSquidGame">blocked</a>. As <a href="https://gizmodo.com/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scammers-make-off-with-2-1-m-1847972824"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> explained, its creators staged what&#39;s called in the crypto world as a &quot;rug pull,&quot; wherein the coin&#39;s creators cash out for real money and disappear. The scammers may have made off with as much as $3.38 million.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There were multiple signs that the cryptocurrency was a scam from the start — people merely missed or ignored them, perhaps due to the promise of a game based on the popular Netflix show. Its website was riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, and as <em>Gizmodo</em> pointed out, people were able to buy coins but weren&#39;t allowed to sell them.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time a coin based on a pop culture phenomenon was launched, and it won&#39;t be the last. While some may be legit, those interested to invest in them will have to keep an eye out for signs of fraud. Just earlier this year, a cryptocurrency based on <em>The Mandalorian</em> turned out <a href="https://gizmodo.com/tiktok-influencer-apologizes-after-promoting-scam-mando-1846596562">to be a scam</a>, as well.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scam-073957132.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">08ab1832-b333-4469-8a5b-1bf78846eaa7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 02 Nov 2021 07:39:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635858027</ingested><modified>2021-11-02T13:00:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5396e290-3ba6-11ec-b7b0-a7fef2d57060" width="1600" height="966" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5396e290-3ba6-11ec-b7b0-a7fef2d57060" width="1600" height="966" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Squid Game]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Squid Game]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Squid Game]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta details its latest efforts to combat climate change as COP26 starts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html">Facebook&#39;s parent company</a>) has joined other major tech companies in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/is-big-tech-greenwashing-its-environmental-responsibilities-ahead-of-cop-26-170038455.html">making more climate change pledges</a> as the UN’s COP26 summit commences.

On top of that, in more than a dozen countries, Facebook is expanding its use of <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/connecting-people-with-credible-climate-change-information/">labels</a> on climate change posts to direct users to the center.</p><p>The UN will soon update its <a href="https://www.un.org/actnow">ActNow</a> chatbot on Messenger, Instagram and its website to suggest 10 more actions users can take to fight combat change.

Starting today, the company is opening 10 locations in the Netherlands to non-Tesla EVs as <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/non-tesla-supercharging">part of a pilot program</a>. Provided you live in the country and you’ve installed the Tesla app on your phone (version 4.2.3 or later), you can use them to charge your car. The stations are located in Sassenheim, Apeldoorn Oost, Meerkerk, Hengelo, Tilburg, Duiven, Breukelen, Naarden, Eemnes and Zwolle.</p><p>The one thing to note about the pilot is it&#39;s only open to EV drivers who live in the Netherlands. However, if you drive a Tesla vehicle and you’re visiting the country, you can charge your car as normal at the stations. Additionally, how the program expands beyond this initial pilot will depend on congestion at the stations. “Future sites will only be opened to Non-Tesla vehicles if there is available capacity,” the company said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On Monday, the company also put a <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/j1772-gen-2-wall-connector">non-Tesla port home charger on sale</a>.

Effectively, the sticker acts as both a prompt for other people to upload their own Stories and a way for them to discover new people to follow.

Since then, the documents have made their way into the hands of more than a dozen publications who formed “a consortium,” much to the dismay of Facebook’s PR department.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There have now been more than a hundred stories based on the documents. And while many of those reference the same documents, the details are significant. But as important as they are, it’s also a dizzying amount of information. There are detailed documents written by the company&#39;s researchers, free-form notes and memos, as well as comments and other posts in Workplace, the internal version of Facebook used by its employees.</p><p>This mix of sources, together with the fact that the consortium has not released most of the documents to researchers or other journalists, makes the Facebook Papers difficult to parse. <em>Gizmodo</em> has been <a href="https://gizmodo.com/hey-kid-wanna-see-some-leaked-facebook-docs-1847936740"><ins>publishing</ins></a> some of the underlying documents, but new revelations could be trickling out for weeks or months as the material becomes more widely distributed.</p><p>But amid all that noise, a few key themes have emerged, many of which have also been backed up by prior reporting on the company and its policies. This article will detail Haugen’s disclosures, and additional details that have arisen from reporting on the Facebook Papers. We&#39;ll continue to update it as fresh allegations emerge.</p><h2>Facebook allowed politics to influence its decisions</h2><p>This likely won’t be a surprise to anyone who has followed Facebook over the last five years or so, but the Facebook Papers add new evidence to years-long allegations that Mark Zuckerberg and other company leaders allowed politics to influence their decisions.</p><p>One of the first stories to break from Haugen’s disclosures (via <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>) included details about Facebook’s “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html"><ins>cross check” program</ins></a>, which allowed politicians, celebrities and other VIPs to skirt the company’s rules. The initial motivation for the program? To avoid the “PR fires” that may occur if the social network were to mistakenly remove something from a famous person’s account. In another document, also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-politics-decision-making-documents-11635100195"><ins>reported by</ins></a><em>The Journal</em>, a researcher on Facebook&#39;s integrity team complained that the company had made “special exceptions” for right-wing publisher <em>Brietbart</em>. The publication, part of Facebook’s official News Tab, also had “managed partner” status, which may have helped the company avoid consequences for sharing misinformation.</p><p>At the same time, while Facebook’s policies were often perceived internally as putting their thumb on the scale in favor of conservatives, Zuckerberg has also been accused of shelving ideas that could have been perceived as benefiting Democrats. The CEO was personally involved in killing a proposal to put a Spanish language version of its voting information center into WhatsApp ahead of the 2020 presidential election, <em>The Washington Post </em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/"><ins>reported</ins></a>. Zuckerberg reportedly said the plan wasn’t “politically neutral.”</p><h2>Facebook has serious moderation failures outside the US and Europe</h2><p>Some of the most damning revelations in the Facebook Papers relate to how the social network handles moderation and safety issues in countries outside of the United States and Europe. The mere fact that Facebook is prone to overlook countries that make up its “rest of world” metrics is not necessarily new. The company&#39;s massive failure in Myanmar, where Facebook-fueled hate <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-06-facebook-myanmar-bsr-report.html"><ins>helped incite</ins></a> a genocide, has been well documented for years.</p><p>Yet a 2020 document noted the company still has “significant gaps” in its ability to detect hate speech and other rule-breaking content on its platform. According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/facebook-knew-about-failed-police-abusive-content-globally-documents-2021-10-25/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, the company’s AI detection tools — known as “classifiers” — aren’t able to identify misinformation in Burmese. (Again, it’s worth pointing out that a 2018 <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/11/myanmar-hria/"><ins>report</ins></a> on Facebook’s role in the genocide in Myanmar cited viral misinformation and the lack of Burmese-speaking content moderators as issues the company should address.)</p><p>Unfortunately, Myanmar is far from the only country where Facebook’s under-investment in moderation has contributed to real-world violence. CNN <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/25/business/ethiopia-violence-facebook-papers-cmd-intl/index.html"><ins>notes that</ins></a> Facebook’s own employees have been warning that the social network is being abused by “problematic actors” to incite violence in Ethiopia. Yet Facebook lacked the automated tools to detect hate speech and other inciting content even though it had determined the country was one of the most “at risk” countries.</p><p>Even in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-violence-india-leak-221447186.html"><ins>India</ins></a> — Facebook’s largest market — there’s a lack of adequate language support and resources to enforce the platform’s rules. In one document, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/23/technology/facebook-india-misinformation.html"><ins>reported by</ins></a><em>The New York Times</em>, a researcher created a test account as an Indian user and started following Facebook’s automated recommendations for accounts and pages to follow. It took just three weeks for a new user’s feed to become flooded with “hate speech, misinformation and celebrations of violence.” At the end of the experiment, the researcher wrote: “I’ve seen more images of dead people in the past three weeks than I’ve seen in my entire life.” The report was not an outlier. Facebook groups and WhatsApp messages are being used to “spread religious hatred” in the country, according to <em>The Wall Street Journal’s</em> analysis of several <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-services-are-used-to-spread-religious-hatred-in-india-internal-documents-show-11635016354"><ins>internal documents</ins></a>.</p><h2>Facebook has misled authorities and the public about its worst problems</h2><p>Lawmakers, activists and other watchdogs have long suspected that Facebook knows far more about issues like misinformation, radicalization and other major problems than it publicly lets on. But many documents within the Facebook Papers paint a startling picture of just how much the company’s researchers know, often long before issues have boiled over into major scandals. That knowledge is often directly at odds with what company officials have publicly claimed.</p><p>For example, in the days after the Jan. 6 insurrection, COO Sheryl Sandberg said that rioters had <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/sandberg-says-us-capitol-riot-was-not-organized-on-facebook.html"><ins>“largely”</ins></a> organized using other platforms, not Facebook. Yet a report from the company’s own researchers, which first surfaced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-stop-the-steal-policies-report-205339822.html"><ins>in April</ins></a>, found that the company had missed a number of warning signs about the brewing “Stop the Steal” movement. Though the company had spent months preparing for a chaotic election, including the potential for violence, organizers were able to evade Facebook’s rules by using disappearing Stories and other tactics, according to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-failed-stop-the-steal-insurrection"><em><ins>BuzzFeed</ins></em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Likewise, Facebook’s researchers were internally sounding the alarm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-carols-journey-qanon-reports-005159230.html"><ins>about QAnon</ins></a> more than a year before the company banned the conspiracy movement. A document titled “Carol’s Journey to QAnon” detailed how a “conservative mom” could see QAnon and other conspiracy theories takeover their News Feed in just five days only by liking Pages that Facebook’s algorithms recommended. “Carol’s” experience was hardly an outlier. Researchers ran these types of experiments for years, and repeatedly found that Facebook’s algorithmic recommendations could push users deeper into conspiracies. But much of this research was not acted on until “things had spiraled into a dire state,” one researcher wrote in a document <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-knew-radicalized-users-rcna3581"><ins>reported</ins></a> by <em>NBC News</em>.</p><p>The documents also show how Facebook has misleadingly characterized its ability to combat hate speech. The company has long faced questions about how hate speech spreads on its apps, and the issue sparked a mass <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-does-facebook-ad-boycott-accomplish-231311517.html"><ins>advertiser boycott</ins></a> last year. According to a document cited by Haugen, the company’s own engineers estimate that the company is taking action on “as little as 3-5% of hate” on its platform. That’s in stark contrast to the statistics the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-hate-speech-prevalence-170144850.html"><ins>typically showcases</ins></a>.</p><p>Similarly, the Facebook Papers indicate that Facebook’s researchers knew much more about vaccine and COVID-19 misinformation than they would share with the public or officials. The company declined to answer lawmakers’ questions about how COVID-19 misinformation spreads even though, according to <em>The Washington Post</em>’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/28/what-facebook-knew-about-covid-19-misinformation-didnt-tell-congress/"><ins>reporting</ins></a>, “researchers had deep knowledge of how covid and vaccine misinformation moved through the company’s apps.”</p><h2>Facebook has misled advertisers and shareholders</h2><p>These are the allegations that could end up being some of the most consequential because they show serious problems affecting the company’s core business — and could tie into any future SEC action.</p><p>Instagram has long been viewed as a bright spot for Facebook in terms of attracting the teens and younger users Facebook needs to grow. But increasingly, teens and younger users are spending more time and creating more content in competing apps like TikTok. The issue is even more stark for Facebook, where “teen and young adult DAU [daily active users] has been in decline since 2012/2013,” according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-25/facebook-files-show-growth-struggles-as-young-users-in-u-s-decline"><ins>slide shared by</ins></a><em>Bloomberg.</em></p><p>The story points out another issue that could get the company into hot water with the SEC: that the company is overcharging advertisers and misrepresenting the size of its user base due to the number of duplicate accounts. Though this is hardly the first time the issue has been raised, the company’s own reports suggest Facebook “undercounts” the metric, known as SUMA (single user multiple account), according to <em>Bloomberg.</em></p><h2>Zuckerberg prioritized growth over safety</h2><p>While the Facebook Papers are far from the first time the company has faced accusations that it puts profit ahead of users’ wellbeing, the documents have shed new light on many of those claims. One point that’s come up repeatedly in the reporting is Zuckerberg’s obsession <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/27/tech/facebook-papers-meaningful-social-interaction-news-feed-math/index.html"><ins>with MSI</ins></a>, or meaningful social interaction. Facebook retooled its News Feed around the metric in 2018 as a strategy to combat declining engagement. But the decisions, meant to make sure Facebook users were seeing more content from friends and family, also made the News Feed angrier and more toxic.</p><p>By optimizing for “engagement,” publishers and other groups learned they could effectively game the company’s algorithms by, well, pissing people off. But politicians learned they could reach more people by posting more negative content, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>. Publishers also complained that the platform was incentivizing more negative and polarizing content. Yet when Zuckerberg was presented with a proposal that found reducing the amount of some re-shared content could reduce misinformation, the CEO “said he didn’t want to pursue it if it reduced user engagement.”</p><p>That wasn’t the only time a Facebook leader was unwilling to make changes that could have a detrimental effect on engagement, even if it would address other serious issues like misinformation. Several documents detail research and concerns about Facebook’s “like” button and other reactions.</p><p>Because the News Feed algorithm prioritized a “reaction” more than a like, it boosted content that received the “angry” reaction even though researchers flagged that these posts were much more likely to be toxic. “Facebook for three years systematically amped up some of the worst of its platform, making it more prominent in users’ feeds and spreading it to a much wider audience,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/26/facebook-angry-emoji-algorithm/"><em><ins>The Washington Post</ins></em></a> wrote. The company finally stopped giving extra weight to “angry” last September.</p><p>Facebook slow-walked, and in some cases outright killed, proposals from researchers about how to address the flood of anti-vaccine comments on its platform, the <em>AP</em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/the-facebook-papers-covid-vaccine-misinformation-c8bbc569be7cc2ca583dadb4236a0613"><ins>reported</ins></a>.</p><p>The company has also been accused of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-mental-health-senate-hearing-210317155.html"><ins>downplaying research</ins></a> that found Instagram can exacerbate mental health issues for some of its teen users. The documents, which were some of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-research-instagram-teen-mental-health-slides-003452675.html"><ins>first records</ins></a> to emerge from Haugen’s disclosures, forced Facebook to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pausing-work-on-instagram-kids-app-124639135.html"><ins>“pause”</ins></a> work on an Instagram Kids app that had already drawn the attention of 44 state Attorneys General. The research also prompted the first Congressional hearing as a result of Haugen&#39;s whistleblowing.&nbsp;</p><h2>What does all this mean for <del>Facebook</del> Meta?</h2><p>While the Facebook Papers contain a dizzying amount of details about Facebook’s failures and misdeeds, many of the claims are not entirely new allegations. And if there’s one thing Facebook’s history has taught us, it’s that the company has never let a scandal affect its ability <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-facebook-q2-earnings.html"><ins>to make billions of dollars</ins></a>.</p><p>But, there are some signs that Haugen’s disclosures could be different. For one, she has turned over the documents to the SEC, which has the authority to conduct a wide-ranging investigation into the company’s actions. As many experts have <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/26/technology/facebook-sec-complaints.html"><ins>pointed out</ins></a>, it’s not clear what could actually come from such an investigation, but it could at the very least force Facebook’s top executives to formally answer detailed questions from the regulator.</p><p>And though Haugen has said she is not in favor of antitrust action against the social network, the FTC has reportedly begun to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ftc-privacy-kids-11635289993?mod=hp_lead_pos3"><ins>take a look</ins></a> at the disclosures. (The FTC is already in the midst of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-asks-for-ftc-antitrust-charges-dismissed-again-180704263.html"><ins>legal battle</ins></a> with Facebook.) Facebook already seems to be reacting as well. The company has asked employees to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/technology/facebook-legal-communications.html"><ins>preserve documents</ins></a> going back to 2016, <em>The New York Times</em> reported this week. There are other, more practical, issues too. The company is reportedly struggling to recruit engineering talent, according <a href="https://www.protocol.com/workplace/facebook-docs-hiring-recruiting-crisishttps://www.protocol.com/workplace/facebook-docs-hiring-recruiting-crisis"><ins>to documents</ins></a> reported by <em>Protocol.</em></p><p>The constant scandals and internal roadblocks have also taken a toll on existing employees. For as much scrutiny as the company has faced externally, the Facebook Papers paint a picture of a company whose employees are at times deeply divided and frustrated. The events of January 6th in particular sparked a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/10/25/facebook-jan-6-election-claims-516997"><ins>heated debate</ins></a> about Facebook’s role, and how it missed opportunities to recognize the threat of the “Stop the Steal Movement.” But there have been fundamental disagreements between researchers and other staffers, and Facebook’s leaders <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/technology/facebook-like-share-buttons.html"><ins>for years</ins></a>.</p><p>As <em>Wired</em><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-papers-badge-posts-former-employees/"><ins>points out</ins></a>, the Facebook Papers are full of “badge posts” — Facebook speak for the companywide posts employees write upon their departure from the social network — from “dedicated employees who have concluded that change will not come, or who are at least are too burned out to continue fighting for it.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whats-in-the-facebook-papers-and-what-it-means-for-the-company-194502237.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a08b6343-57e7-4df5-a44d-189e5c0331b3</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 19:45:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635795252</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T19:34:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f94d7cf0-3b45-11ec-bbff-34186a422de0" width="1800" height="995" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f94d7cf0-3b45-11ec-bbff-34186a422de0" width="1800" height="995" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Meta (Modified by Engadget)]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[What the Facebook Papers means for the company formerly known as Facebook.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zuckerberg metaverse.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon’s Project Kuiper will launch two prototype satellites by the end of 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has hit another milestone on the way to its goal of putting 3,236 low Earth orbit to blanket most of the planet with internet access. On Monday, the company <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/innovation-at-amazon/project-kuiper-announces-plans-and-launch-provider-for-prototype-satellites">filed</a> a license application with the Federal Communications Commission to launch two prototype satellites, KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2. They will feature many of the technologies the company plans to include in the final production variant of its constellation satellite, giving it the chance to test how those systems fare outside of a lab environment. At the same time, the tests will allow it to validate its launch procedures and mission management when it comes time to start putting its full network in orbit.</p><p>&quot;We’ve invented lots of new technology to meet our cost and performance targets for Project Kuiper. All of the systems are testing well in simulated and lab settings, and we’ll soon be ready to see how they perform in space,&quot; said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology for Project Kuiper. &quot;There is no substitute for on-orbit testing, and we expect to learn a lot given the complexity and risk of operating in such a challenging environment.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Amazon, it will launch KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 toward the end of 2022. Once the test is complete, the company plans to deorbit the satellites so they don’t add to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/were-entombing-the-earth-in-an-impenetrable-shell-of-dead-satellites-163002560.html"><ins>junk pile that’s circling the planet</ins></a>. Additionally, one of the satellites will feature a sunshade so Amazon can see if it helps make it less reflective and thereby less visible to telescopes on the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>With today’s announcement, Amazon shared it’s working with ABL Space Systems to put KuiperSat-1 and KuiperSat-2 in space. The company’s new RS1 rocket will ferry the satellites to orbit. One of the main design features of Amazon’s Kuiper craft is that they’re compatible with multiple launch systems, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-project-kuiper-atlas-v-173405832.html"><ins>Atlas V</ins></a> rocket from United Launch Alliance.</p><p>Once it completes the test, Amazon will need to move quickly to put the entire system into space. When the FCC <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fcc-approval-project-kuiper-065621687.html"><ins>approved its initial plan</ins></a>, the company said it would put half the satellites in orbit by 2026 and the entire constellation by July 30th, 2029.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-project-kuiper-test-2022-190551476.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">89b47068-2aed-490a-ac9e-fdb10215a4ca</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 19:05:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635793497</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T19:05:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c689e1f0-3b45-11ec-bfe4-6811c6a1b4b8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c689e1f0-3b45-11ec-bfe4-6811c6a1b4b8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Project Kuiper]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Project Kuiper]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chevrolet's 1957 Project X car is now an EV]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most famous cars <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chevrolet/"><ins>Chevrolet</ins></a> ever built is now an electric vehicle.

Over the decades, it has been used to test a range of power technologies. Before the electric system, it had a Chevy LSX V-8 engine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The car now has a 400-volt electric powertrain with an estimated 340 horsepower and 330 pound-feet of torque — those are very similar numbers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cadillacs-lyriq-ev-will-boast-300-plus-miles-of-range-130020680.html">Cadillac&#39;s Lyriq EV</a>. Chevrolet says the battery can store 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity. The range depends on the quick-change differential that&#39;s fitted, which can be swapped to optimize the car for acceleration or range. Still, Chevy claims the now-EV has &quot;enough range for weekend cruising.&quot;</p><p>Although the car still has the front suspension that was installed in 2007, Cagnazzi Racing made some changes, such as swapping to an electric brake booster and electrohydraulic power steering pump. Some springs have been switched too, as there&#39;s less weight under the hood and more at the rear compared with the previous incarnation. Project X now has the same push-button gear selector as the 2021 Chevrolet Corvette as well.</p><p>This is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-09-chevy-e-10-concept-electric-hot-rod-truck.html">third straight year</a> that Chevy has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevy-k5-blazer-e-project-191600554.html"><ins>converted a classic car</ins></a> into an EV for SEMA.

The chipmaker says it will <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/11/01/qualcomm-announces-goal-achieve-net-zero-emissions-2040">achieve net-zero emissions by 2040</a>. Here’s the roadmap the company laid out. By 2030, Qualcomm says it will reduce its Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent from base 2020 levels. That same year, it plans to reduce its Scope 3 emissions by 25 percent from where they were in 2020.</p><p>Scope 1 includes all pollution produced directly by the company or any emissions sources it owns or controls. Scope 2, meanwhile, entails indirect emissions created from the electricity, heating and cooling Qualcomm consumes. Lastly, Scope 3 includes all other indirect emissions produced by its value chain.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the context of a company like Qualcomm that relies on TSMC, Samsung and other foundries to produce its chips, reducing its Scope 3 emissions is the most impactful (and difficult) way the company can lessen its impact on the environment.

Facebook shared details of the network in its <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/october-2021-coordinated-inauthentic-behavior-report/">monthly report</a> on coordinated inauthentic behavior on the platform.</p><p>In addition to hundreds of fake accounts on its platform, the troll farm also operated a “a complex network of media brands” on Blogspot, Wordpress and Telegram, Facebook said in a statement. Some fake accounts posed as government supporters, while some posed as university students, who led protests against the government in 2018. The fake account also mass-reported activists and other government critics in an attempt to get them banned from Facebook. Beginning in 2019, the group also began &quot;posting and artificially amplifying praise about the Nicaraguan government and the ruling FSLN party.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While it’s not the first time Facebook has caught a government running this kind of operation, Facebook said the Nicaraguan effort was unique because they were able to link it to multiple government institutions, including the Social Security Institute and Supreme Court. The country’s post office headquarters Managua served as a “main hub” for the troll farm, and government workers even appeared to post on a regular 9am-5pm schedule.</p><p>“This was really the closest thing we&#39;ve yet seen to a whole-of-government operation,” Facebook’s Global Threat Intelligence Lead for Influence Operations, Ben Nimmo, said during a call with reporters. “This is the first time that I can think of [that] we&#39;ve seen so many different institutions getting involved.”</p><p>It’s also notable that Facebook traced the start of the operation back to 2018, meaning much of the activity went undetected for years. Nimmo noted that while the company’s automated systems were able to detect and disable some of the fake accounts in 2018, the operation was “complex” and time-consuming to investigate.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-takes-down-government-run-troll-farm-in-nicaragua-173235024.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cae1a942-db7a-4059-a195-dae56b5b36e1</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 17:32:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635787956</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T17:32:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1a81c630-387e-11ec-bf62-031fa403c017" width="3790" height="2551" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1a81c630-387e-11ec-bf62-031fa403c017" width="3790" height="2551" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook logo and new company brand Meta Platforms Inc. logo are pictured in this illustrative photo taken in Kyiv on 29 October, 2021.
