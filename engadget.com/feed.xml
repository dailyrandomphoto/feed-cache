The trick, as you might imagine revolves around a custom cartridge — you&#39;re technically running the game on a separate system.</p><p>The cartridge houses a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-14-raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus.html">Raspberry Pi 3</a> mini-computer running the RetroPie emulator and streaming both video and input through the GBA&#39;s multiplayer-oriented Link Port. Yes, that&#39;s constraining as you think it is — you can&#39;t transfer more than 1.6Mbps bi-directionally, and the Pi has to routinely give the &quot;poor&quot; GBA&#39;s processor a break for a few microseconds. Alfonso suggests lowering the stream resolution from the console&#39;s native 240 x 160 if a high frame rate is important.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Still, the results are mostly impressive. The special cart can handle classics like the <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> series and <em>Spyro the Dragon</em> at smooth frame rates, albeit with some video artifacts that reflect the limited bandwidth. You can overclock the GBA&#39;s processor to improve the frame rate and quality.</p><p>You&#39;ll have to build the cartridge and load code yourself, although Alfonso has helpfully provided both <a href="https://github.com/rodri042/gba-remote-play">on GitHub</a>. This probably won&#39;t replace <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wont-stop-selling-psp-games-after-july-2nd-065844351.html">a PSP</a> if you want the most authentic PlayStation handheld experience you can get.

Everything from music and TV streaming to guided meditations to password management has a service that you can pay for to make your life more convenient. These are also things we don&#39;t think about buying very often — typically, you sign up once and only revisit the service when you&#39;re thinking of changing things up or cancelling. But Black Friday is a good opportunity to check out new subscription services you may have considered in the past because many of them have sales for new (and sometimes returning) customers. Here are the best deals on subscription services you can get this Black Friday.</p><h2>Adobe CC All Apps plan</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7c411d60-46e5-11ec-b7f8-4b5c10881084" alt="Woman editing photo on computer.

If you&#39;re a student, it&#39;s even cheaper — just $16 per month for first-time customers. These programs are considered standard in most creative fields, so it&#39;s worth grabbing this deal if you know you&#39;ll be using things like Photoshop or Illustrator in the future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://bit.ly/3EVHeBP" id="a15f9c70131c47709817b93465fa8dca" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adobe;elmt:viglink;pdid:">Subscribe to All Apps plan at Adobe - $30/month</a><h2>Headspace</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d4f45440-46e5-11ec-bfbf-ee0b432e89b8" alt="Headspace" data-uuid="b34162df-637f-305c-81d9-be2428168b1f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Headspace</div></figure><p>The meditation app <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Headspace" href="https://fave.co/3mQA8Hp">Headspace</a> is down to $5 per month for new and returning customers for Black Friday.

As <em>Kotaku</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/activisions-damage-control-reaches-sad-new-low-1848107710">reports</a>, the developer has <a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-board-directors-continues-build-upon-its">formed</a> a &quot;Workplace Responsibility Committee&quot; to help it implement new anti-harassment and anti-discrimination efforts. While that sounds useful at first, there&#39;s a concern the initial committee is more symbolic than functional.</p><p>The committee will launch with just two members, both of whom (chair Dawn Ostroff and Reveta Bowers) are existing independent board members. They, in turn, will report to the board and key Activision Blizzard executives — including CEO Bobby Kotick, who some argue is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employees-call-ceo-bobby-kotick-resign-194513764.html">partly to blame for the scandal</a>. The duo will work with an outside coordinator and a consultant following the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-settles-eeoc-18-million-lawsuit-005806200.html">settlement with the EEOC</a>, but there&#39;s no mention of involving regular company staff or outsiders who weren&#39;t part of that court agreement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As such, it won&#39;t be surprising if the committee does little to satisfy critics. Employees and others have called on Kotick to resign, among other more substantial changes. There&#39;s also low confidence in leadership&#39;s ability to police itself — Jennifer Oneal, Blizzard&#39;s first female leader, allegedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-jen-oneal-step-down-mike-ybarra-213704384.html">left her position</a> feeling she was the target of discrimination by a seemingly irredeemable company culture. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-11-19/activision-blizzard-s-atvi-board-is-full-of-ceo-bobby-kotick-s-friends?sref=10lNAhZ9">noted</a> that some board members (including Ostroff) are Kotick&#39;s longtime friends and connections, for that matter.

Sure, they&#39;re not the flashiest gadgets but they&#39;re some of the most useful, providing extra space for photos, documents, games and more in a travel-friendly package. One of our favorites, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung T7 Touch" href="https://amzn.to/3CIagDh">Samsung T7 Touch</a>, is already on sale for Black Friday — the 500GB model is down to $90, or 18 percent off its normal price and only a few dollars more than its all-time low. You can pick up the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:1TB version" href="https://amzn.to/3xdWPtX">1TB version</a> for 21 percent off now that it&#39;s down to $150, or a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2TB model" href="https://amzn.to/3l2WUM6">2TB model</a> for $300.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3CIagDh" id="09937f1405054f3e836f4c5fc4520158" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy T7 Touch at Amazon starting at $90</a><p>The &quot;Touch&quot; portion of the drive&#39;s name comes from its built-in fingerprint reader that provides an additional defense against prying eyes. The T7 supports optional password protection, but on the Touch, you can choose to use your fingerprint to unlock the device and access saved files. The T7 is physically protected as well with its shock- and drop-resistant body, which is also small enough to fit into nearly any pocket of any bag or backpack.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We also appreciate the use of ePCM technology and Dynamic Thermal Guard to control heat levels, which means that the drive won&#39;t overheat even when you&#39;re pushing it to its limits. And you may do that a lot depending on how you use the drive. It comes with both a USB-C to C cable and a USB-C to A cable, so it can work with most gadgets — including some game consoles. Overall, the T7 Touch is a versatile SSD that&#39;s made better by its extra layer of security.</p><p>If you can forgo the fingerprint reader, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:standard T7 drives" href="https://amzn.to/3Ck7XpV">standard T7 drives</a> have also been discounted to new record-low prices.

Being the newest Apple Watch, we don&#39;t expect to see major discounts on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Series 7" href="https://amzn.to/3DOtAA8">Series 7</a> this holiday season — but you can get the wearable for $20 less right now on Amazon. The online retailer has a few colors of the Series 7 for $380, which is a record low. Some <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:GPS + Cellular models" href="https://amzn.to/3cG6fEV">GPS + Cellular models</a> are also $20 off, if you wanted to spring for the most independent version of the Watch.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DOtAA8" id="d97eb2818d4e4add9a43be4596d9d082" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Series 7 (GPS) at Amazon - $380</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3cG6fEV" id="0f99a95bff2c41ae9c4a10daab8a9a5b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Series 7 (GPS + Cellular) at Amazon - $480</a><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Series 7</a> retains the same footprint of the Series 6, but Apple enlarged the screen by slimming down the bezels to just 1.7mm. What that means in practice is that you have more screen real estate on your wrist, which makes a noticeably difference in usability. Everything is a bit clearer and less cramped, and more things can fit on the screen — like the on-display QWERTY keyboard that the Series 7 has access to in watchOS 8. That lets you type out iMessages whenever you want, although some may still prefer dictation or quick replies to that method.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This Apple Watch also charges a bit faster than previous versions. In our testing, we got 10 percent juice in just 10 minutes of charging, and the Watch was fully powered in under an hour. This will undoubtably come in handy if you forget to place your Watch in its charger overnight, or if you make use of Apple&#39;s sleep tracking feature and want to power up before heading out for the day.</p><p>Otherwise, the Series 7 is the most comprehensive Apple Watch to date. You&#39;re getting all of the sensors and features possible here including a blood oxygen sensor, an ECG measurement tool, GPS, heart rate monitor, altimeter and more. Also, you&#39;re getting an always-on display, which makes it easier to check notifications without raising your wrist. If you&#39;ve had your eye on the Series 7 since it was announced, this is the best deal we&#39;ve seen on it since then.

According to the watchdog, the two companies signed an agreement in 2018 that would prohibit both official and unofficial resellers of Apple and Apple-owned Beats products on Amazon&#39;s Italian website. That agreement allegedly contained contractual clauses that only allowed Amazon itself and select sellers &quot;chosen individually and in a discriminatory way&quot; to sell those items.</p><p>AGCM said in its announcement that those clauses violate article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In addition, the watchdog said the agreement restricted cross-border sales, ultimately limiting buyers&#39; options and depriving them of the discounts typically offered by third-party sellers. The Italian authority <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-italy-antitrust-investigation-141046089.html">opened</a> the antitrust case against both companies in 2020 and even searched their offices in the country.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A total of 70 percent of consumer electronics purchases in the country are from Amazon, AGCM explained, and 40 percent were purchases from sellers that use the website as their main platform. That&#39;s why it&#39;s essential for Amazon to implement Italy&#39;s competition rules and ensure a level playing field for all sellers, as well as to ensure that buyers have access to more options.</p><p>AGCM imposed a fine of €68.7 million (US$77 million) on Amazon and a fine of €134.5 million (US$151.2 million) on Apple. It also ordered the companies to end the restrictions and allow the sale of Apple and Beats products on Amazon Italy in &quot;non-discriminatory manner.&quot; In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/italys-antitrust-fines-amazon-apple-more-than-200-mln-euros-alleged-collusion-2021-11-23/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Amazon called the imposed penalty &quot;disproportionate and unjustified.&quot; A spokesperson said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We reject the suggestion that Amazon benefits by excluding sellers from our store, since our business model relies on their success. As a result of the agreement, Italian customers can find the latest Apple and Beats products on our store, benefiting from a catalogue that more than doubled, with better deals and faster shipping.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Apple denied any wrongdoing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, both companies are planning to appeal the watchdog&#39;s penalty.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-fined-228-million-italy-restricting-beats-sales-123325114.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b51f0908-6fa4-453d-8742-b074ed6d5ba2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 12:33:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637670878</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T12:34:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a86b77c0-4c51-11ec-bbfe-527302eb48ec" width="3500" height="2308" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a86b77c0-4c51-11ec-bbfe-527302eb48ec" width="3500" height="2308" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrew Matthews - PA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[General view of a pair of beats Mixr headphones alongside an Apple iPhone 5, as Apple will make the most expensive acquisition in its history, after confirming a deal to buy Dr Dre's Beats Electronics for 3 billion dollars (&pound;1.78 billion).

Now, Tile has been acquired family tracking company Life360 for $205 million in a move that could give it the resources to better contend with rivals. It will continue to operate with the same branding under current Tile CEO CJ Prober, Life360 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/life360-to-acquire-tile-creating-the-world-leader-in-finding-and-location-solutions-301430364.html">announced</a>.</p><p>Life360 said the acquisition will help it expand beyond family tracking to letting people &quot;locate the people, pets, and things they love.&quot; It noted that the addition of Life360&#39;s 33 million smartphone users will increase the reach of Tile&#39;s Finding Network by around 10x.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, Life360 will gain access to consumers in 27,000 retail stores where Tile trackers are sold. Tile&#39;s technology is also used in over a million third-party devices, ranging from wireless earphones to dog collars. The company will also acquire Tile&#39;s subscribers, boosting its total paid subscriber base by 45 percent to 1.6 million users.</p><p>The company emphasized that both Life360 and Tile are &quot;platform agnostic,&quot; working on both iOS and Android. The subtext is that Apple&#39;s AirTags only work on iOS, though Apple does have <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/03/airtag-privacy-improvements-sound-android-app/">plans</a> to introduce Android compatibility by year&#39;s end. Last year, Tile <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-apple-european-commission-antitrust-143303005.html">filed an EU complaint</a> against Apple for alleged anticompetitive behavior, claiming the iOS 13.5 update made its app harder to use.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s certainly synergy between the companies, as Life360 has operated as a multi-platform &#39;Find My Friends&#39;-style service for years. Parents in the US, especially, have used the devices to keep track of their kids — so adding the ability to track objects and gadgets makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tile-to-be-acquired-by-family-location-sharing-service-life-360-103400952.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ace2f260-fc89-439a-9b32-367261314528</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 10:34:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637663641</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T10:34:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cdd18100-4c40-11ec-be7a-030bc674b5e8" width="1500" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cdd18100-4c40-11ec-be7a-030bc674b5e8" width="1500" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tile to be acquired by Life360 for $205 million]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ Tile to be acquired by Life360 for $205 million]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dodge to phase out its Challenger and Charger muscle cars in shift towards EVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dodge is phasing out its gas-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-dodge-charger-r-t-125300079.html">Charger</a> and Challenger muscle cars by 2024 in favor of electric muscle cars, <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-challenger-charger-dead-2024-ev-coming-soon/"><em>Motor Trend</em></a> has reported.

The first concept arriving in 2022 will be an electric muscle car, revealed in the next four or five months as a high-performance, drivable vehicle. The next model, a plug-in hybrid, will be a new car but not a Durango as some expected, according to Kuniskis. The third vehicle is unknown, but will be a &quot;very, very, very, significant car at the end of the year,&quot; he added.&nbsp;</p><p>Diehard muscle car fans might not take the news well, though they can&#39;t deny the superior performance of EVs. Dodge <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/11/22/the-muscle-car-goes-electric-dodge-sets-2024-end-date-for-gas-chargers-challengers/">previously advertised</a> the Challenger in &quot;Demon&quot; trim as the quickest 0-100MPH production car in the world, with the rather large caveat that it &quot;excludes non-mass production vehicles [supercars] and hybrids/electric.&quot;</p><p>Kuniskis acknowledged that the announcement could create friction. &quot;I&#39;m juggling knives because I&#39;ve gotta keep two different huge factions happy because at some point those two factions will converge,&quot; he said. &quot;The problem is no one knows when they will converge. My job is to provide confidence, over the next 24 months, that we&#39;re gonna do this.&quot;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dodge-is-killing-its-challenger-and-charger-muscle-cars-in-favor-of-e-vs-085839976.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4d6942e8-0c34-4bf4-a0d2-2d8948dfc2c8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 08:58:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637657921</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T08:58:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/73bace10-4c36-11ec-97fd-2156a6563c37" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/73bace10-4c36-11ec-97fd-2156a6563c37" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Raymond Boyd via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CHICAGO - FEBRUARY 06:  2020 Dodge Charger SXT is on display at the 112th Annual Chicago Auto Show at McCormick Place in Chicago, Illinois on February 6, 2020.

Kojima is known for his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html">film-like approach</a> to making games, and if you <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1462586580023922689?s=20">follow him on Twitter</a>, you&#39;ll know he frequently tweets about his favorite albums and movies. The question now becomes how the studio plans to handle the expansion. Since reforming in 2015, Kojima Productions has released one game. You can push that number to two if you count the recent Director&#39;s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-trailer-release-date-220511148.html"> Cut</a> release of <em>Death Stranding</em> as a separate title.

The feature essentially allows users to both watch a broadcast and shop at the same time. The first live shopping stream will debut on November 28th at 7PM ET when Walmart <a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1461640769240854529">hosts a Cyber Week-themed</a> livestream with Jason Derulo.

Additionally, the company is expanding the availability of the “Shop Module.” First announced in July, the tool allows brands and businesses to add a carousel to their profile that can highlight a selection of products. Over the coming weeks<strong>, </strong>the company says it will roll out the feature to more merchants in the US.</p><p>Compared to other social media platforms, Twitter has been slow to embrace and add e-commerce features.

(If you don’t know, Game &amp; Watch were a line of handheld LCD devices from the ‘80s that could each play one very simple game.) Rather than featuring a single title, the Super Mario anniversary device had a full version of the original adventure as well as its Japan-only sequel, known in the West as <em>Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels</em>.</p><p>Nintendo’s pulling the same trick this year with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zelda-game-watch-cute-release-date-2021-170211386.html">35th-anniversary Legend of Zelda-themed Game &amp; Watch </a>that just went on sale. And like last year’s model, it includes a color screen and full games, but the selection is more generous. It includes the original <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</em>, both originally released on the NES. It also includes <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>, which came out on the Game Boy in 1993, making this essentially a collection of Zelda’s early 8-bit adventures.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="9e195ca3-908a-4f1b-a864-e55c15b91250"/><p>I actually have never really played the first two Zelda games, though I do love <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review.html">played the Switch remaster</a> a few years ago, but I haven’t touched the original game since my childhood — so when we got a chance to check this tiny device out, I was pretty thrilled to give that game a go.</p><p>The Game &amp; Watch itself is elegantly designed, but also feels rather cheap. It’s a tiny, palm-sized device with an eye-catching gold front, while the rest of the device is clad in green plastic. The front has a 2.36-inch color LCD screen that is very small but also looks great — and when playing <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, the upgrade from the Game Boy’s screen, which had no backlight, is dramatic. The D-Pad and buttons are nothing to write home about, but they’re good enough.</p><p>On the right side of the device is an exceedingly modern USB-C port for charging its battery (which is pretty meager, so you’re going to need to do that a lot) and a power button; the speaker is on the left side. Finally, there’s a great Easter egg on the back: When the screen is on, the Triforce glows subtly through the green plastic. It’s a great little detail.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/258dd402-4bad-11ec-b8be-2eb0c10a1f07" alt="The Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch" data-uuid="44813193-260a-3805-9dfe-42549c2b8267"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Game &amp; Watch has a few different modes: clock, timer and game. Pressing the “game” button lets you switch between the three Zelda titles, a Link-themed version of <em>Vermin</em> (from a 1980 Game &amp; Watch), and the timer. The clock and timer are fairly self-explanatory, but their use of Zelda action as backgrounds is expertly done.</p><p>On the clock, you’ll see the original <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, and the CPU-controlled Link essentially battles his way through the game over the course of the next 12 hours, defeating Ganon and rescuing Zelda at 11:59. If you’re so inclined, you can pick up the console and control the action from the clock screen at any time. Likewise, the timer features a handful of different scenes from <em>Zelda II: The Adventure of Link</em> that you can either watch or play yourself. The device’s packaging even converts into a little stand so you can use the Game &amp; Watch as a desk clock.</p><p>If you’re interested in this Game &amp; Watch, though, you’re not in it for playing the clock: you want to relive Link’s earliest adventures on the smallest portable device you can find. Sure, you can play the NES Zelda collection on the Switch (or many other old Nintendo devices), but the Game &amp; Watch’s miniature screen and old-school controls feel just right for these adventures. That’s doubly true with <em>Link’s Awakening</em>, since it was originally designed for portable systems.</p><p>The games themselves are exactly as you remember them, with no quality of life enhancements or graphics updates; <em>Link’s Awakening</em> is in black and white, rather than the later “DX” version released for the Game Boy color. I’m not complaining, though, as these original versions seem right for the Game &amp; Watch as a celebration of the series’ 8-bit origins.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/258dd400-4bad-11ec-9e7f-06f68fb39497" alt="The Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch" data-uuid="96806375-923f-3239-8e5a-3913e18737fe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>How you feel about these games will depend on your history with the series. Like I said, I’ve never played the original NES Zelda adventures; I got on board with <em>A Link to the Past</em> in 1992. As such, I don’t have a lot of nostalgic love for the original pair, and playing the first game was an exercise in frustration. There’s barely a map, Link is slow while enemies are fast, and aiming is imprecise at best. I definitely died more than my fair share of times, which was rather humbling for this self-described Zelda expert. But hey, I shouldn’t have expected anything different from a 1986 game, and I started to get the hang of it soon enough.</p><p><em>Link’s Awakening</em>, on the other hand, was like visiting an old friend. Muscle and brain memory combined to have me slashing my way through it in no time at all, and it controlled just like I remembered. The A and B buttons may have felt rather squishy, but the D-pad was close enough to the one on my old Game Boy that I felt right at home. I don’t know if I’ll finish the NES Zelda games, but I’ll definitely play through <em>Link’s Awakening</em>.</p><p>So who exactly is this $50 device for? The <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Game &amp; Watch was really only meant for people who loved that first Mario game, not necessarily people who love the Mario franchise in general. Likewise, The Legend of Zelda Game &amp; Watch is best for someone who loved these original games growing up. It doesn’t even have to be all three, though — if one of them was a formative gaming experience, you’ll delight in getting a chance to play it on a cute little handheld. But someone raised on <em>Twilight Princess</em> or <em>Breath of the Wild</em> probably will find these a lot less essential.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/legend-of-zelda-game-and-watch-review-173041656.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4555aee0-ce9e-408a-b6a0-25d56a1ff37d</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 17:30:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637607992</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T19:06:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2fa43af0-4bc7-11ec-b05f-b2c162bd8587" width="1897" height="1187" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2fa43af0-4bc7-11ec-b05f-b2c162bd8587" width="1897" height="1187" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The rectangular Zelda Game & Watch sitting on an old wooden desktop.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zelda Game & Watch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analogue's Pocket handheld starts shipping on December 13th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-delay-december-220026363.html"><ins>multiple delays</ins></a>, the Analogue Pocket finally has an exact release date.
