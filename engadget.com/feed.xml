The modern take on ‘90s portable gaming ($220) offers so much more than just the ability to play most vintage portable games. It has built-in music making software, TV/video out via an accessory and, well many other things we wanted to do a proper dive on. We’ve had so much fun with this thing it’s very easy to recommend right up top. If you simply wanted to know if it’s a good gaming device, I can safely say that it is and thanks for stopping by. If you want to know more (and you should) then get comfortable as we’re going for a ride.</p><p>First, a little history. Analogue is often described as a “boutique” console manufacturer. It specializes in a very specific type of retro remake. Instead of building a small PC that can run emulators, Analogue’s FPGA “cores” allow it to mimic vintage consoles at the hardware level. The idea being, all games play as nature intended with none of the emulator quirks to contend with. The company’s early creations were more in the “how to spend it” category. This <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-04-18-analogue-interactive-crafts-a-neo-geo-mvs-from-walnut-yours-for.html">walnut Neo Geo</a>, for example, or how about this slightly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-11-analogue-nt-mini-review.html">too-fancy NES</a> (and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-analogue-nt-mini-noir-edition.html">all-metal reboot</a>).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>More recently, Analogue’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-27-analogue-mega-sg-review.html">Mega SG</a> (Genesis) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-23-analogue-super-nt-snes-console-review.html">Super NT</a> (SNES) took a slightly more accessible approach, cementing the company’s place as <em>the </em>retro console maker de jour. The Pocket aims to build on this legacy with a focus on, somewhat obviously, gaming on the go. It’s also the first Analogue console to play carts from different retro brands.</p><div id="2d4457ee2b67469d8826c1437b8568ad"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pwyxul-E3Ps" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>At launch, it natively plays cartridges from any of the Game Boy variants. It’ll also play Game Gear cartridges with an adapter. Neo Geo Pocket Color, TurboExpress and Atari Lynx adapters are on the way.</p><p>Another key difference to most retro machines is that Analogue products are designed to play physical media, not ROMs (although you can sometimes find ways around that as the internet is ever industrious). This really is about doing the old school thing in a modern way with minimal adulteration. That said, the Pocket is compatible with flash carts (that can play ROMs from an SD card), but that’s a quirk of its fidelity  – if it works on a Game Boy, it likely works here etc..</p><p>By extension, you can also use any of the original Game Boy accessories such as the GB Camera, printer and any titles that had extras such as rumble packs or gyro sensors. You can even connect the Pocket to an authentic Game Boy for multiplayer player fun. In short, all of Analogue’s consoles are functionally 1:1 reproductions of the hardware they honor, just with the Pocket it’s multiple systems in one.</p><p>There are, of course, some modern advances that are deemed useful enough to not distract from the authentic experience. For one, the Pocket has a backlit display. Something that didn’t make its way into a Game Boy until the Advance SP (although there was the Game Boy Light in Japan). The Pocket’s 3.5-inch screen is also bigger than the largest on any Nintendo GB handheld (2.9-inches on the Advance SP) and covered in modern Gorilla Glass. Then, of course, there are some modern tweaks such as “save states” and a variety of display presets to match the original hardware (including modes for different iterations of Game Boy).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/bf7ad9d0-5e65-11ec-beaf-66bbc6080703" alt="Analogue Pocket review." data-uuid="52b55400-c902-381d-9f3e-26323f241faf"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>What you won’t see here are endless submenus with the hyper specific settings that you tend to find in emulators (or their frontends) like <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/">RetroArch</a>. It’s clear the goal with the Pocket is to remove as much user configuration as possible so you can plug in your game and go. Likewise, the Pocket’s connectivity is limited to the Game Boy link port, a headphone jack and an IR port for Game Boy Color (GBC) games <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Game_Boy_Color_games_with_IR_support">that support it</a> (such as <em>Donkey Kong Country </em>or <em>Pokémon Crystal</em>). That’s to say, there’s no touchscreen, no WiFi or any other such redundant jazzy features.</p><p>Alas, there’s also no video out, but this can be added with the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/dock-faq">Dock accessory</a> ($99) which allows for Bluetooth/USB controller connectivity along with an HDMI port for connecting to a TV. Battery-wise, thankfully, it’s not a trip to Target for a big stash of AAAs. The 4,300 mAh cell is good for around six hours of play time and it charges over USB-C.</p><p>It’s pretty clear that the Pocket’s design was heavily inspired by the original dot-matrix Game Boy (aka DMG – that’s the iconic one <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-21-nintendo-game-boy-30th-anniversary.html">pictured here</a>) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-wii-handheld-console-mod-153954715.html">GBC</a> with its portrait configuration. Although one obvious difference is you’ll find four main buttons, which is curious as every system the Pocket imitates only had two – although some, like the Atari Lynx, do have additional system buttons. There are also (slightly spongy) shoulder buttons around the back which were introduced on the Game Boy Advance (GBA), along with “start” and “select” buttons at the bottom, with one more inbetween them that brings up the Analogue menu whatever you’re playing/doing.</p><p>Those extra thumb buttons make more sense when you take into account that Analogue has not only partnered with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-gameboy-gbstudio-rom-game-builder.html">GB Studio</a> — a popular drag-and-drop Game Boy game making tool — but has also added a dedicated spare FPGA for developers to tinker with and use for their own homebrews. How that gets used we’ll have to wait and see, but if you make games in GB Studio you can run them right off the Pocket’s SD card using a proprietary .pocket format. In short, the handheld is aiming to be a viable platform for indie titles made within the constraints of ‘90s era hardware.</p><p>Did I mention that it has music production chops, too? The Pocket comes with a version of Nanoloop — a lightweight but comprehensive music-making app for Game Boy — baked right in. Analogue even made cables specifically so you can connect it to desktop and MIDI sequencers. More on this later.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1eabaa30-5e64-11ec-a9f7-ae26ccf911a9" alt="Analogue Pocket review." data-uuid="1dc58d13-f50d-324e-8144-f08cd501baa8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The above is a long way of saying that it’s obvious Analogue has put a lot of thought and care into making something that isn’t just <em>another</em> way to play <em>Super Mario Land</em>. The addition of tools for developers and an easy pathway to play indie creations give the Pocket one foot in the present. The addition of Nanoloop, likewise, gives it a broader appeal without breaking away from its retro authenticity.</p><p>So, you get it, it’s a clever little thing, but what does it play like? I won’t lie, when I inserted <em>Tetris </em>and powered the Pocket up I was, well, I was taken to the Analogue OS home screen. Right now it’s very simple with five menu options, of which, only three are currently available: Play Cartridge, Tools and Settings. The other two are Library and Memories which are currently grayed out until the first firmware update — which Analogue says is coming in a few weeks from publish time. There’s a lot to be excited about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-os-retro-gaming-162028559.html">in Analogue OS</a>, but for now it’s pretty straightforward, and I’ll flag the more interesting parts as they come.</p><p>Back on the home screen, tapping “Play Cartridge” suddenly teleported me to my secondary school in 1990. The Game Boy had just been released and a few people in my year had one. I still remember being fascinated by the weird green and black display and crunchy sound. The Pocket in its original DMG screen mode replicates this look with amazing accuracy. I have other retro handhelds, and the “authentic” green-and-black modes combined with a mishmash of resolutions and displays never look quite right. Even the fact that the Pocket has a backlight, which of course the first ever Game Boy never had, somehow doesn’t break the spell.</p><p>For example, the Pocket even replicates the tiny gaps between pixels on the DMG’s display. This means that the fist-pumping plumber in the top left of <em>Super Mario Land</em>’s home screen looks almost indistinguishable from how he did in 1989 (bar that light). My other handheld that runs a fork of <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/">RetroPie</a> doesn’t have this level of fidelity. You can do all sorts of custom configurations to possibly come close, but that’s long and life is short. Pocket does it out of the box, no tweaking needed.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/86c15aa0-5e61-11ec-a77d-91e6785ad295" alt="Analogue Pocket review." data-uuid="9681c4fe-1c2c-3f14-b1f4-9cfac4d74a6d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you prefer your nostalgia hit to feel like other versions of the Game Boy, there are modes for those, too. Specifically the Game Boy Light and the Game Boy Pocket. There’s also Analogue’s own custom mode. What’s interesting is that if you place a GBA game into the Pocket, the choice of display modes changes to match. That’s to say, you’ll get the screen variants of that platform (Original LCD, SP 101) along with another custom Analogue mode specific to that system. As for the Game Gear, you’ll get Analogue mode, GG LCD mode and “GG LCD+” which is like the former, with just a shade more pop in its colors.</p><p>Analogue’s own display modes tend to be more modern in style with higher color saturation and no pixel grid. Beyond the presets there are some controls for customization within the menus. These are done by system, and include desaturation controls, sharpness and a frame blending toggle (to mimic the original hardware’s slow responsiveness). Though they are nowhere near as extensive as on most software emulators, and I feel it’s all the better for it. I am not against deep levels of control, but navigating RetroArch’s deep menus has never been my kind of fun.</p><p>One slight quirk here is that when you change the volume during play, you’ll see a corresponding plus or minus sign float over the left side for a second or so. But if the Pocket is in certain display modes, like Analogue’s own custom preset, or <em>any</em> game with a white background, you can’t see it because it’s showing white on white. It doesn’t change anything, but it did catch me out for a moment wondering if the volume control wasn’t working.</p><p>Thanks to the square display, original Game Boy games perfectly fill the space available and, not coincidentally, the Pocket’s display is exactly 10x the resolution of the original on each axis. This means upscaling is really just a case of adding a zero onto the end of the number of pixels being displayed. Specifically it’s an 1600x1440, 615 ppi LCD.</p><p>This sort of detail is almost as important (maybe as important) as running emulation at the hardware level rather than software. Retro gaming has a storied history of using computational and display limitations <a href="https://twitter.com/CRTpixels/status/1408451743214616587">for creative effect</a>. If you’ve ever played old games on a modern emulator and display, you may have noticed something was a bit off; that retro “feel” wasn’t there. That’s why many emulators offer things like scanlines — because they soften square edges and make things look a bit more authentic.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/509c9340-5e61-11ec-af6e-d8f6a04944cc" alt="Analogue Pocket review." data-uuid="33270fd1-d517-34b5-829c-d3d0ae96c82c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The problem is, scanlines are a bit of a blunt tool. Analogue claims it went out of its way to mimic original displays, “quirks” and all. And from what I can tell, that includes things like response time and refresh rates.</p><p>An example of this is found among the GBA screens. Despite being a big step up in the number of colors it could display at one time (512 up from the GBC’s 56) the screen still didn’t have a light until later iterations. This gave the games on the early GBAs a distinct look and you can activate a mode that replicates that, if that’s your preference. Or go more modern if it’s not. The benefit to this will largely depend on the game you are playing, as some lean into the limitations of the hardware more than others, but it feels much more authentic than regular old scanlines to me in terms of juicing that vintage vibe.</p><p>I, personally, love the original screen modes. They feel like scanlines done right. The start screen for Sonic on the Game Gear, for example, somehow seems more detailed when viewed in the original GG LCD mode. Our hedgehog’s wagging finger seems just that little more detailed and the font more “3D” – for lack of a better word.</p><p>In terms of game compatibility, theoretically, there should be very few titles that worked on original hardware that don’t work here, if any. I only had 10 or so games to test with, but the only things that were problematic were a US version of <em>Mario Kart Super Circuit </em>and <em>Mickey Mouse - Castle of Illusion</em> on the Game Gear which loads fine but crops off some of the bottom of the game.</p><p>The European version of Mario Kart I had worked just fine, but the US one seemed to stall after loading. Analogue suggested I give that cart a good clean, which I did, several times, but I never got it to work despite it working instantly on my GBA. It’s clear that there’s no reason it shouldn’t work, and a company rep confirmed their copy works their end, but such are the quirks of very old cartridges, perhaps there’s just something off with the pins on that one copy that doesn’t sit right on the Pocket. As for Mickey? Analogue says that’s to do with how that particular game was programmed and there’s already a fix coming in new firmware.</p><p>The only other thing that didn’t work was a very unofficial “108 games in one” multicart. That also seemed to at least open but then just hung. This also worked in original hardware, but again… it’s hard to know if it’s just a physical quirk (pins aligning etc) or something else.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c50090b0-5e61-11ec-bd6f-228269175230" alt="Analogue Pocket review." data-uuid="ee98ad9a-5960-335e-9cf1-2b26e96bb025"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>What <em>did</em> work was the Game Boy Camera. It’s always surprising to me that cartridges that relied on watch batteries for saves would still work today, but both the camera and every other game I had with a cell in it seemed to still be going strong with saves intact. Either way, the Game Boy camera is a delight on the Pocket, that backlight really helps. It remains pretty awful on vintage hardware. Analogue also tells me that in the forthcoming erosion v1.1 firmware update, you’ll be able to save your Game Boy Camera photos directly to the Pocket’s SD card. This is actually very cool indeed given that, right now, extracting images from it is kinda a pain in the butt and involves either getting hacky or spending out on something like a ROM dumping cart.</p><p>For anything other than the Game Boys, you’ll need a separate $30 adapter to play. Right now the only one available is the aforementioned Game Gear one. I won’t lie, with a game inside it does look a little inelegant, with the cart popping right over the top of the Pocket. I was only able to test the two games on it, and one is the weirdly-cropped Mickey Mouse, but it was still playable and just as much fun (and infuriating) as I remembered the first time around. The fact you can’t jump on top of and ride those tree stumps still doesn’t sit right with me all these years later.</p><p>Of course, three generations of Game Boy plus the Game Gear already opens up a pretty substantial library but once the adapters for the Atari Lynx, the Neo Geo Pocket and the PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16 arrive there’s a whole lot of fun to be had with this one tiny console. Notably, the last system in that list is technically a home console and not a handheld. So there’s more than just portable gaming here. The TurboExpress just happened to take the same game cards as the home-based PC Engine. Such is the curious world of retro gaming.</p><h2>Analogue OS</h2><p>I already mentioned the basics of the Pocket’s native operating system. Right now, it’s mostly limited to playing cartridges and some high-level system tweaks. You’ll find some video and audio options and a few system-specific settings (like playing GBC games in GBA mode). Right now, even save states are barely supported. The version of the OS I tested has a quick-and-dirty save/load state option and that’s it. Analogue claims, however, that version 1.1 “will allow you to do everything imaginable with save states.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/dcf05040-5e64-11ec-9bab-15a24dd76972" alt="Analogue Pocket review." data-uuid="ad9296d0-b586-337e-8636-989d4a5f1338"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The more intriguing feature that’s currently unavailable is “Library.” On its website, the company describes Analogue OS as “purpose-built for exploring and celebrating all of video game history.” It claims to offer the option to install the artwork for every single game it could play, full save states, game “playlists” and more.</p><p>That “more” includes the ability to develop custom FPGA “cores” so you can, within limits, turn the Pocket into other retro systems, although there are plenty of caveats and also, a high level of skill in this area is involved. A skill I definitely do not have. Fortunately, there’s a strong community around Analogue and its <a href="https://www.retrorgb.com/mister.html">open source rival MiSTer</a>. Both pull from the same family of FPGA chips so the likelihood of cool stuff coming further down the line is very high.</p><p>Though it’s not clear how playlists or the game library will work, given that you have to have the cartridge inserted into the Pocket to play a game, any software shortcut for that seems a little redundant, at least for now – I’m interested to see how it’s actually implemented. Where this will really come into its own, I suspect, is in making the Pocket experience more holistic and complete. Having access to information and data about the entire world of retro gaming in your hands along with the ability to share playlists and game progress will definitely add a robust layer to the platform. Either way, for now there really does seem to be a lot of exciting new features coming, yet sadly we can’t test them until that next firmware update gets released.</p><h2>The Dock and other accessories</h2><p>While the Pocket is all about reviving the handheld magic and all its portability, Analogue made a dock that adds a few important features. Most obviously, it allows you to play your favorite retro games on the biggest screen in the house over HDMI. I won’t lie, it wasn’t quite the seamless experience I was expecting. First, I needed to update the firmware. That’s normal given this was an early test unit, but I still had a few occasions where I had to do things in a certain order for it to take.</p><p>Once I had it working though, it’s pretty straightforward. The first thing you’ll notice is how pixelated things are. No fault of the Pocket’s obviously. This is just what happens when you upscale a game made for a 2.5-inch display and run in on a 55-inch modern TV. It’s still perfectly playable though and adds a nice alternative playing option.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/98965e00-5e62-11ec-af6f-0cb919ba6559" alt="Analogue Pocket review." data-uuid="243c6eeb-4141-3e2d-9067-630be02992ee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are some other important benefits to the dock. Not only can you add USB controllers as mentioned, you can also connect Bluetooth and 2.4g controllers. This opens up the possibility of four players where GB Studio titles developed for third-party FPGA cores support it. Given there are only two USB ports on the dock, you’ll need two wireless controllers as well to achieve this. Though it appears you could use four Bluetooth ones at the same time (but support for 2.4g controllers tops out at two).</p><p>Right now, you’ll either need a USB controller with a long cable or one of the officially supported 8Bitdo wireless controllers (Pro 2, M30 and the Arcade Stick). PS4 and Switch Pro controllers will also work. More options will be supported in that all important 1.1 update (SN30 Pro, <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/pce-2-4g/">PCE </a>and so on).</p><p>That said, I was able to pair an SN30 controller today and it worked just fine. I also had success with a very old, very generic Xbox controller, so it seems support is there, perhaps they are just ironing out some kinks.</p><p>One final thing I should note is that when playing via the Dock, most of the display modes become inactive and you’re shuttled onto what appears to be the Analogue preset by default. Analogue’s home consoles to date have come with extensive options for filtering, resizing, adding faux scanlines and the like when playing on a modern TV, so it would be good to see a similar suite of options come to the Dock.</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>There’s an unsung benefit to imitating a system at the resistor level via FPGA – you can connect the Pocket to original Game Boys for multiplayer fun. This is no small thing. Modern software emulators allow for online multiplayer on many systems (usually with <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=netplay">Netplay</a>), but often this falls apart for handhelds. The need for a cable back in the day made it quite a lot harder to trick a game into thinking it’s connected to another “machine.” There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8xHcM7YMX4">some workarounds</a>, but they aren’t always so elegant or authentic (half the magic with handhelds is your own private screen).</p><p>With the Pocket, you can literally just plug it right into another Game Boy, if you have the right cable. The port on the Pocket matches that of the Game Boy Pocket (GBP) and onward. That’s to say, if you had a GBC and two copies of Tetris you can use the original Nintendo link cable and it should work. If you don’t happen to have the original cable you can buy Pocket’s own do-it-all link cable ($16). The only two models that aren’t instantly compatible are the DMG and the Micro.</p><p>I tested out the following scenarios using Analogue’s own cable: Pocket GBC and Pocket to GBA. All worked perfectly. Even GBA games that support Single Pak two player (only one copy of the game needed) work. <em>Mario Kart Super Circuit</em> is one such title and the experience is just like the old days – just a little bit of waiting for the game to setup and you’re off to the proverbial races. Two player <em>Tetris</em> was as fun as it ever was and I might just have to buy another one of these things as you can, of course, also just connect two Analogue Pockets together, too.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f90cd850-5e61-11ec-b7da-e2f230393cad" alt="Analogue Pocket review." data-uuid="8c6b7cc5-e2b3-3e01-9375-4b027a7eb19d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Nanoloop</h2><p>It’s beyond the scope of this review to give a full breakdown of what Nanoloop is, but if you’ve ever seen (or heard) music made/performed on a Game Boy, this humble app is likely running the show (or <a href="https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php">LSDJ</a>, but they are both conceptually similar).</p><p>A version of Nanoloop is built right into the Pocket’s OS and it’s not just a nice add-on feature. This is evidenced by Analogue selling no less than four different cables ($20 each)  that allow you to connect Nanoloop on the Pocket to external MIDI hardware, Desktop music MIDI software, other Pockets and hardware with audio sync (such as Korg’s line of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-17-korg-volca-modular-west-coast-synth-review-weird-affordable.html">Volcas </a>or Teenage Engineering’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-22-teenage-engineering-pocket-operators-irl.html">Pocket Operators</a>).</p><p>I won’t lie, if you’re not familiar with music sequencing, the learning curve here is steep. Add into that the limited sonic capabilities of the Game Boy and it’s hard to eke something musical out of the app. At least at first. Persevere, though, and you might just find that Nanoloop is something of a stealth addiction – certainly it’s a great value add that I really hope draws in more people to the platform. Given that you can pipe out the audio to headphones or a dedicated speaker via the headphone port it’s not just a time sink, you can be annoying your friends and neighbors in no time.</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/21976a60-5e62-11ec-bafd-e8af7048afeb" alt="Analogue Pocket review." data-uuid="594d9f45-1bf4-32f0-b162-ec948108b268"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’ve got this far, then there’s a good chance that, like me, you’re pretty excited about the Pocket. For casuals, $220 to play games you might already own (or worse, have to navigate the second hand market to buy) might not quite be the value proposition you were looking for. And that’s fine, Pocket isn’t aimed at casuals. Pocket is for those that love, live and breathe retro gaming and who want the absolute best experience possible.</p><p>For handheld gaming, right now, Pocket <em>is</em> that best experience. Absolutely hands down, no doubt about it. Everything from start to finish is as authentic as it can be without being needlessly pedantic (like <em>not</em> having a backlight for DMG/GBC games etc.). The experience is further elevated by select modern concessions. The aforementioned light, the curated display presets and the smart features in the operating system to mention a few.</p><p>The fact that Analogue added in some complementary additions, such as that spare FPGA core and the tight support for GB Studio only serves to reassure me that the Pocket will just get better with time. There are, of course, a few areas for improvement. The shoulder buttons aren’t the best. Some of the display modes obscure on-screen messages at times. The adapters look a little goofy with a game in them. But these are details. And detail is, apparently, what Analogue does best. And perhaps the bigger detail to be concerned about is getting yourself a spot in line.

Like with last year’s iPhone 12s, this year’s models don’t come with a charging adapter, so that’s one thing you’ll probably need to have on hand. If you plan on going all-in on wireless charging <em>could</em> you skip that, though, and thankfully there are many more MagSafe accessories to choose from now than there were last year. We’ve tested out some of the newest iPhone accessories available and gathered the best ones here.</p><h2>Apple MagSafe wireless charger</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/499d4ef0-3f03-11eb-b8af-05de4022855e" alt="Apple MagSafe wireless charger"><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>There are often better and cheaper alternatives to Apple’s first-party accessories, but the company’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MagSafe wireless charger" href="https://amzn.to/3d4ADZU">MagSafe wireless charger</a> is worth considering if you have a new iPhone. Like all other MagSafe accessories, this charging pad uses magnets to attach to the back of the latest iPhones and it’s surprisingly strong. Not only can you safely pick up your handset and use it with the disk still attached, but the iPhone can dangle by the charger’s cord without falling off. (You still probably shouldn’t do this.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The charging plate itself is about a quarter-inch thick so it barely adds any heft to the iPhone. The magnets only attach to the latest iPhones, but it will still charge older models wirelessly, going back to the iPhone 8. I only wish the cable were longer than three feet so that you had more leeway to use your iPhone on the couch or in bed while powering it up.</p><p>Apple’s accessory comes in at $39 (although we’ve seen it go on sale a few times), but if you want to spend a bit less, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Spigen&#x002019;s $25 ArcField magnetic wireless charger" href="https://amzn.to/3o7bowr">Spigen’s $25 ArcField magnetic wireless charger</a> is a decent dupe.

It also has an optional attachment for an Apple Watch, which means it could actually charge up to five devices at the same time.</p><p>I found the mat useful as a charging hub, turning to it each night to charge my iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods Pro. It’s worth noting that both my iPhone and my AirPods Pro live in cases, and I didn’t have to remove either in order to charge them with Mophie’s mat. But while the mat’s size allows it to do a lot at once, it’s also tough to find a big enough spot for it. It’ll fit on most nightstands, but you may have to rearrange things first.

The magnets in the charging pad are quite strong and able to hold up an iPhone 13 Pro Max so it looks like it’s floating in mid air. You can even use it when your iPhone has a MagSafe case on, too. Since the iPhone screen is angled upward and clearly visible while charging, Anker’s device would make a good addition to a desk, or even a nightstand for those who want to use their phone as their evening clock.

While not all of them are made out of braided nylon, those that don’t still have a 12,000-bend lifespan so you can use it without fear of wire fraying after a few weeks.

Out of all of the stands I’ve used, it’s the one that looks and feels most like a tripod thanks to its micro ball-head, which lets you adjust the angle of your phone nearly 360 degrees, and its three legs, which provide much more support than your standard phone-case kickstand.</p><p>The Mobile Tripod is a solid option for those who use their phone cameras for everything from family photos to vacation landscape shots, and those who want to use their phone almost as a second screen while travelling. It’s a bit steep at $80, but you’re paying for a sturdy accessory with a thoughtful design — plus the Peak name. Of course, there are plenty of more affordable MagSafe phone stands such as <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Moft&#x002019;s Snap-On Stand and Wallet" href="https://amzn.to/3oakoAK">Moft’s Snap-On Stand and Wallet</a>, which props up your iPhone while holding a few credit cards, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anker&#x002019;s MagGo phone grip" href="https://amzn.to/3rrTOW2">Anker’s MagGo phone grip</a>, and the now-ubiquitous <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:PopSockets" href="https://amzn.to/3xI6qct">PopSockets</a>. Just keep in mind that, while MagSafe accessories like these are convenient, they ultimately won’t be as sturdy as something securely snapped onto your smartphone. All of the MagSafe stands, wallets, chargers and other accessories I’ve tried eventually fell off if I applied enough force.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3G8MJhb" id="51804cedb0264481a4522d29163feeca" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Peak Design;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Mobile Tripod at Peak Design - $80</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3oakoAK" id="ec145f5e3d76456a8fba8a27a6b2c53a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Moft Snap-On Stand and Wallet at Amazon - $30</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3rrTOW2" id="d58a5db601e941a6b1a7320ac6d398ce" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MagGo phone grip at Amazon - $16</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xI6qct" id="627d7215222d4e4bb0c8aaffe13aebe0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MagSafe PopGrip at Amazon - $30</a><h2>MagSafe cases</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/e5383550-3f03-11eb-abff-6d7ebf63e346" alt="Apple Silicone MagSafe iPhone 12 case, Otterbox Symmetry+ MagSafe iPhone 12 case"><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>There are many more MagSafe cases available now than there were just a year ago, and they run the gamut from affordable to quite expensive. If you like silicone cases, it’s usually best to save some money and get a third party one rather than buying Apple’s. However, the first-party silicone MagSafe case is worth considering for its luxurious feel and slim design. It doesn’t add much heft to the iPhone at all and it gives you a bit more protection against scratches and drops. It also has a premium, smooth texture that makes it nicer to hold than cheaper silicone cases.</p><p>Apple also makes hard-shell MagSafe cases, but we typically prefer Otterbox for that level of protection. The company’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Symmetry+ line" href="https://fave.co/3d8jtL6">Symmetry+ line</a> is only a hair thicker than Apple’s but they are slightly more flexible, making it easier to take your iPhone in and out. They also have Otterbox’s signature rubberized bumper around the edges and, although you can’t remove it like you can with some of its other heavy-duty cases, it provides an extra cushion if you accidentally drop your iPhone.</p><p>But Otterbox’s cases will set you back $60 or more — for something more budget-friendly, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Spigen&#x002019;s Mag Armor series" href="https://amzn.to/3ocidgj">Spigen’s Mag Armor series</a> is worthy of consideration. At around $20 each, these cases are made of shock-absorbing TPU and they have a raised lip around the camera array to protect it. They’re compatible with MagSafe accessories and they only add about 0.15-inches of thickness to the overall profile of your iPhone. These are good options if you want to add only what’s necessary to your phone to protect it against the occasional drop or bump.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3d8jtL6" id="dd3bf21e88e54f8591129dbda85907da" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Otterbox;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Shop Otterbox Symmetry+ cases</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ocidgj" id="0c6a1daeb5584fada0d2c19855743298" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Spigen Mag Armor case at Amazon - $20</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-iphone-accessories-140022449.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">627af3fd-594b-3179-8c13-badf394090c0</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 14:58:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639753116</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T14:58:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[anker]]></category><category><![CDATA[iPhone12]]></category><category><![CDATA[iphoneaccessories]]></category><category><![CDATA[otterbox]]></category><category><![CDATA[Belkin]]></category><category><![CDATA[aukey]]></category><category><![CDATA[mophie]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[magsafecharger]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[iphone]]></category><category><![CDATA[magsafe]]></category><category><![CDATA[Apple]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2487e970-1a9c-11ec-9fdd-7a2e61c7e295" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2487e970-1a9c-11ec-9fdd-7a2e61c7e295" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A green iPhone 12 and pink iPhone 13 with their backs facing the camera.

It also comes with the latest Hypersmooth 4.0 feature that stabilizes rough bumps, along with new tone mapping and noise reduction. All of that results in noticeably better and smoother video, which helped it achieve an excellent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-10-review-a-big-invisible-upgrade-130041612.html">92 Engadget review score</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with the Hero 9, it has a front screen that lets you frame yourself when looking at the camera, but that display now runs at a smoother 30 fps rather than 20 fps as before. Other features include a new horizon leveling option and faster navigation. The main downside is lower battery life compared to the GoPro 9.</p><p>The new deal is even better than Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-offers-the-first-discount-50-off-on-the-new-go-pro-hero-10-125903501.html">$450 price</a> we saw during Amazon&#39;s Black Friday sales. However, keep in mind that you can still get one cheaper from GoPro directly if you&#39;re willing to sign up for its 1-year GoPro subscription.

According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-slows-meta-platforms-metaverse-strategy-by-extending-antitrust-probe-of-vr-deal"><em>The Information</em></a>, one of the purchases the Federal Trade Commission is looking into is its $400 million deal to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-acquiring-within-supernatural-123904948.html">acquire Within</a>, the developer of popular virtual reality workout app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/supernatural-vr-workout-app-beat-saber-chris-milk-130014895.html">Supernatural</a> for the Oculus platform.&nbsp;</p><p>The agency reportedly opened a probe into the purchase after Thanksgiving, almost a month after the companies announced the acquisition back in October. If the report is true — neither the FTC nor the companies confirmed the regulatory review to the publication — then Within and Meta wouldn&#39;t be able to finalize the deal for another year. It could take even longer than that if the agency challenges it in court.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Within wasn&#39;t the only VR app developer that Meta had acquired, but the others were apparently too small to be investigated. VR fitness apps, like at-home workout equipment, soared in popularity during the lockdown, and Supernatural quickly became popular after its launch in April 2020. As <em>The Information</em> notes, one of the FTC&#39;s possible lines of inquiry is whether Meta was planning to develop a VR workout app of its own. It will take Meta less time to snap up an existing product than make one of its own, after all.</p><p>Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg famously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-case-161230871.html">said</a> in the past that &quot;it&#39;s better to buy than to compete,&quot; with regards to Facebook&#39;s Instagram acquisition. The FTC recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-case-161230871.html">filed new antitrust charges</a> against the company, accusing it of using its Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions in 2012 and 2014 to secure its position in the market. Meta is still also facing an investigation over its reported $400 million <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-144640114.html">Giphy purchase</a> in 2020.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-ftc-probe-acquisition-vr-workout-app-supernatural-within-125553153.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">05fc6cef-336b-4349-aaaf-1753f60ad32b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 12:55:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639745644</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T12:54:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25d6dd30-5f30-11ec-8fff-8f9e06f6542b" width="1600" height="1040" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25d6dd30-5f30-11ec-8fff-8f9e06f6542b" width="1600" height="1040" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Within/Meta]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Supernatural]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Supernatural]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: 'Final Fantasy XIV' is so popular that Square Enix stopped selling it]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Square Enix is <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/e7388986bc24d5a1337e0beed057f7b5b78b9bb3"><ins>suspending</ins></a> the sales and delivery of<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-suspends-final-fantasy-xiv-sales-114053735.html"><em><ins>Final Fantasy XIV</ins></em></a><em> Starter Edition</em> and <em>Complete Edition</em> because it&#39;s doing too well and the company&#39;s servers can&#39;t keep up.

The day of the announcement, the magazine posted a photo of assorted print issues with the caption “Since 2014.” But by the next day, the account had mysteriously vanished. @Meta now hosts all the content from the @Facebook Instagram page, while posts from <em>META</em>, the magazine, now appear under the @readmeta handle.

Typical image sensors have the light-sensitive photodiodes and pixel transistors that control and amplify the signal on the same layer. However, the new design puts the photodiodes on top and the pixel transistors below, &quot;approximately doubling saturation signal levels,&quot; Sony said.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony pioneered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-09-21-sony-exmor-rs-stacked-phone-camera-sensors-detuned-over-quality.html">stacked sensors</a> that put fast memory and other electronics directly under the sensor, allowing for faster readout speeds and thus rapid burst shooting and reduced rolling shutter (jello effect) on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">cameras</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-143002186.html">smartphones</a>.

That in turn allows for around double the light-capturing capability.</p><p>Sony notes that because the transistor pixels sit on a separate layer, it was able to boost the amplifier transistors in size. That allows for a bigger signal boost, reducing noise when shooting nighttime or other images in dark locations. The increased dynamic range will allow for &quot;high-quality, low-noise images even in low-light,&quot; according to Sony.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony specifically stated that the tech will allow for higher-quality smartphone photography. With double the light gathering capability, it will allow for much improved light sensitivity even in relatively small, high-megapixel sensors. Sony has yet to say when this tech will make it to smartphone or cameras, but it plans to further improve the design for both large and small sensors.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e701f7d0-5f24-11ec-afd5-27d0f59cf838" style="height:523;width:1031;" alt="Sony&#39;s latest smartphone camera sensor can gather twice as much light" data-uuid="82806018-64df-38b0-ba71-d92bee42a788"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-cmos-smartphone-sensor-2-layer-twice-as-much-light-112503027.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9d69e1e-9a48-4264-8ecb-950c6fdc3089</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 11:25:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639737683</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T10:41:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/faad85f0-3612-11ec-9acf-90247a162075" width="4074" height="2717" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/faad85f0-3612-11ec-9acf-90247a162075" width="4074" height="2717" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[YUKI IWAMURA via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Sony logo is displayed at the company's headquarters in Tokyo on April 28, 2021.

On top of that, the new models come with more accessories to make calibration and working in bright rooms easier.&nbsp;</p><p>The 32-inch model appears to be much the same as before, with features like a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, true 10-bit color, 60Hz refresh rate and 99 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space. As before, it also conforms to the VESA DisplayHDR 400 True Black standard for OLED displays.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The relative lack of brightness and huge contrast ratio shows the compromises and benefits of an OLED display for content creators, in a nutshell. On the one hand, with 400 nits of brightness the UltraFine OLED is barely adequate for doing HDR color grading compared to much brighter (1,000 nit+) mini-LED displays like Apple&#39;s $5,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-pro-display-xdr-hdr-marketing-uk-164640510.html">Pro Display XDR</a> or the $5,000 ASUS ProArt <a href="https://fave.co/3CwT3NN">PA32UCG-K display</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6a17dd20-5f1a-11ec-bd77-880d47f592ef" alt="LG launches a 27-inch version of its pro Ultrafine 4K OLED monitors" data-uuid="9a6c0c05-e818-3a8c-8585-a65215c2eabd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG/Yi Cheol</div></figure><p>On the other, LG&#39;s OLED display has much better contrast, perfect blacks and zero blooming because each pixel illuminates individually. That feature can give color professionals a much better idea of the true contrast in an image. So in essence, buyers have to make a tough choice between brightness and contrast, both of which are important for color work these days — particularly with video.&nbsp;</p><p>The new 27-inch model will attract folks who want the benefits of OLED and the other pro features (10-bit color, 99 percent DCI-P3 and a 1,000,0000:1 contrast ratio) at a lower price. Both displays also offer features like a clean professional design, USB-C with 90W power delivery and four USB ports. It also comes a pair of DisplayPort inputs and one HDMI port. LG&#39;s doesn&#39;t say what kind for the latter, so it&#39;s likely not HDMI 2.1 — though that&#39;s not crucial for content creation pros.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest upgrade over last year is that both monitors include a color calibration sensor (LG didn&#39;t say which one), along with its LG Calibration Studio software. They also come with a monitor hood so you can better control the image depending on room lighting. LG hasn&#39;t released the pricing yet, but its current 32-inch UltraFine Display OLED Pro Monitor costs a cool $4,000, so expect to see a similar price on the new model. The 27-inch version, meanwhile, will likely be north of $2K.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-launches-a-27-inch-version-of-its-pro-ultrafine-4-k-oled-monitors-093236507.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca2274f8-efbd-4592-bdf7-c31584c0d7cf</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 09:32:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639733799</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T09:36:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/45622f90-5f14-11ec-937b-2b6c2b6c1362" width="2560" height="1704" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/45622f90-5f14-11ec-937b-2b6c2b6c1362" width="2560" height="1704" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG/Yi Cheol]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG launches a 27-inch version of its pro Ultrafine 4K OLED monitors]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG launches a 27-inch version of its pro Ultrafine 4K OLED monitors]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG soundbar with a center up-firing speaker will lead its CES audio lineup]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG has given us a glimpse of the audio products it&#39;s showcasing at next year&#39;s CES, specifically the lineup&#39;s crown jewel: A premium soundbar, which the company claims has the &quot;world&#39;s first center up-firing speaker.&quot; The <a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/12/new-premium-soundbar-from-lg-delivers-next-level-audio-for-todays-at-home-lifestyle/">LG S95QR soundbar</a> has an 810W output and 9.1.5 channels of surround sound. That&#39;s five up-firing channels, three of which are on the soundbar itself and two in the separate rear speakers.&nbsp;</p><p>The company says the up-firing channels provide realistic sounds, made even more immersive by the center up-firing speaker that enables clearer dialogue delivery. LG&#39;s premium soundbar supports Dolby Atmos, DTS:X codec and IMAX Enhanced titles for three-dimensional audio. The wireless rear speakers it comes with also have six channels instead of four like previous models do, with their four front/side drivers and two up-firing ones.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, the model has a more sensitive receiver that allows greater distance between the soundbar and its accompanying rear speakers and subwoofer. It was designed with a more stable wireless connection to eliminate drops and lags in audio output, as well. In its announcement, LG is presenting the model as an option for gamers, due to its variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM) features that can adjust its output and ensure that it&#39;s in sync with gaming consoles and PCs.</p><p>The S95QR soundbar uses LG&#39;s AI Room Calibration, the company&#39;s automatic sound tuning technology, to analyze the space it&#39;s in to tailor its output. It also works with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and other AI assistants for voice control. Aside from its audio lineup, LG is showcasing a couple of lifestyle TV models at CES. One of them is design-focused 65-inch OLED Evo TV <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-design-focused-oled-tv-moving-cover-131546091.html">with a motorized cover</a>, while the other is a smaller <a href="https://www.engadget.com/l-gs-stanbyme-wireless-tv-101519278.html">battery-powered TV on wheels</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-soundbar-s95qr-ces-2022-073941883.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">55ab8b04-989c-4f0f-9170-a88c7b88079c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 07:39:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639726784</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T07:39:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/09fcc810-5f01-11ec-ab7e-fefdc8c4567e" width="1600" height="1041" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/09fcc810-5f01-11ec-ab7e-fefdc8c4567e" width="1600" height="1041" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LEAD Technologies Inc.

If social media is any indication, Spotify has had tremendous success with Wrapped. Each year, it seems like Spotify users flock to Twitter and Facebook to share their yearly chronicles. At the same time, you frequently see those who use Apple Music and other platforms lament that their music streaming service of choice doesn’t offer something similar.

According to <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/cable-tech/comcast-will-keep-data-caps-out-of-the-northeast-in-2022/d/d-id/774117"><em>Light Reading</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840165/comcast-data-cap-delay-isp-dec-2021"><em>The Verge</em></a>, a Comcast spokesperson said the cable giant now had &quot;no plans&quot; to enforce internet data caps in the region throughout 2022. State Rep. Andy Vargas even <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAndyVargas/status/1471109198842896384">claimed</a> the strategy might be on indefinite hold — he understood Comcast had &quot;no plans to reintroduce&quot; the ceiling at any point.</p><p>The telecom first said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/comcast-1-2-tb-cap-expanding-181736862.html">in November 2020</a> that it would expand its 1.2TB cap enforcement to the Northeast in 2021, but delayed the move by a year in February 2021.

It will help Northeastern residents breathe easier, though, and could keep their costs down if they don&#39;t want to pay for overages or unlimited data. The additional delay also casts doubt on the need for caps in the first place. If Comcast can go without enforcing caps in numerous states for two years, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-comcast-att-broadband-coronavirus.html">rivals like AT&amp;T</a> can make even broader gestures, why do the caps exist?

In the summer of 2022, the automaker will break ground on a facility about an hour east of Atlanta, Georgia, it <a href="https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-to-site-second-manufacturing-plant-in-georgia"><ins>announced on Thursday</ins></a>.

The company will pay for it with proceeds from its recent November 10th IPO. Once complete, the facility will significantly boost Rivan’s manufacturing capacity. The automaker claims its first and currently only factory in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html">Normal, Illinois</a> can produce about 150,000 cars annually.

It also needs to produce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-rivian-electric-delivery-vans-san-francisco-141525649.html">at least 100,000</a> trucks for Amazon.

Right after Mark Zuckerberg delivered a meandering keynote extolling the benefits of the metaverse, the company revealed it had repainted its iconic “thumbs up” sign that sits at its headquarters in Menlo Park. Many of its social media accounts also switched over, from Facebook to Meta.</p><p>Except for one key account, that is. As many pointed out at the time, the company didn’t control the @Meta handle on Instagram. It belonged to a small Denver-based magazine <a href="https://www.readmeta.com/">called <em>META</em></a>. The day of Facebook’s announcement, the company, which publishes lifestyle stories about motorcycles, posted a photo of assorted print issues with the caption <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVlb1pZlmvc/">“Since 2014.”</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That evening, recent posts from the @Meta account were filled with comments encouraging the owner to “hold” the account, or at least sell it for a high price. “Hold and sell high,” one user wrote. But by the next day, the account had mysteriously vanished, as <em>Quartz </em><a href="https://qz.com/2081386/facebook-has-the-meta-handle-on-twitter-but-not-instagram/">reported</a>. It’s unclear exactly what happened, but @Meta has now subsumed all the content from the previous @Facebook Instagram page. Posts on the account predate October 28th, as if the social network had always controlled it. Posts from <em>META</em>, the magazine, now appear under the @readmeta handle.</p><p><em>META </em>the publisher didn’t respond to requests for comment. But there are still signs of its former Instagram account on its website. The company’s website still links to its old instagram.com/meta account. Oddly, clicking on that link from the publisher’s website turns up an error, even though it links to the same URL as the now Facebook-owned Meta account.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/154e38c0-5ea7-11ec-bffe-3f024dd95e59" alt="The magazine&#39;s website still links to instagram.com/meta but the link doesn&#39;t work anymore." data-uuid="8b3020e8-c132-3362-bd34-fa87b0b0a9d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot / Engadget</div></figure><p>On Tuesday, Ben Geise, <em>META</em>’s co-founder and editor-in-chief, announced that the magazine’s most recent issue would be the last under the name it had used for more than eight years. “We value our individuality above all else, so when the news broke that a corporate Goliath was changing its name to Meta, it felt like a punch to the gut,” he wrote in a <a href="https://www.readmeta.com/blog/keep-on-rolling">blog post</a>. “With the flip of a switch our identity was suddenly watered down, and we watched our name circle the drain and wash away with something we had no control over.”</p><p>Geise didn’t respond to requests for comment, so it’s difficult to know exactly what happened. But Instagram’s terms of service state that businesses are unable to “reserve” handles. And the terms stipulate that companies can’t claim trademark violations if the account owner is using it for an unrelated purpose. “Using another&#39;s trademark in a way that has nothing to do with the product or service for which the trademark was granted is not a violation of Instagram&#39;s trademark policy,” the policy <a href="https://help.instagram.com/101826856646059">states</a>. “Instagram usernames are provided on a first-come, first-served basis.”</p><p>Of course, accounts and handles often trade hands anyway. Businesses have been known to use escrow services to negotiate account transfers, while others have used <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-bans-hundreds-accounts-ogusers-takedown-201528230.html">shadier marketplaces</a> to gain access to accounts with desirable handles.</p><p>But the practice is also <a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870">officially prohibited</a> by Instagram’s terms of service. “You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service,” the terms of service states. “This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.”</p><p>That raises questions about whether Facebook skirted its own rules in order to gain access to a coveted username, the kind of action other users are routinely banned for. Or whether the company found another justification for taking over the account. An Instagram spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>For now, <em>META</em> the publisher says it’s focused on the future. “Our brand is much more than just a name. We represent a way of living,” Geise wrote. “We speak to inspire and encourage the rare breed of humans out there bold enough to chase their dreams and never look back.”</p><p><strong>Update 12/16 7:10pm ET:</strong> A spokesperson for Meta said that there were no trademark claims or legal threats made against <em>META</em> the publisher, but declined to comment on whether the social network had been in touch with the magazine or whether they had been compensated for their username. &quot;We allow people to change their usernames on Instagram,&quot; Meta spokesperson Stepahnie Otway said in a statement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/what-happened-to-the-meta-instagram-handle-195027598.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e376aa9-3ff4-4eb2-a92f-4891be90d071</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 19:50:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639699920</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T00:12:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ce812590-3842-11ec-9d2b-225fab6fcfd5" width="4825" height="3217" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ce812590-3842-11ec-9d2b-225fab6fcfd5" width="4825" height="3217" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CA - OCTOBER 28: People take photos of the new "Meta" sign at the One Hacker Way in Menlo Park, as Facebook changes its company name to Meta in California, United States on October 28, 2021.

Per <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/h-r-block-sues-block-formerly-square-for-trademark-infringement-11639658529?mod=djemalertNEWS"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, H&amp;R Block is suing the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-rebranding-block-224240493.html">formerly known as Square</a>. In a federal complaint filed on Thursday, the tax-prep firm said the name change could hurt its brand. It wants Jack Dorsey’s payments outfit to stop using the name and a logo it contends is “nearly identical” to its own.</p><p>“The goodwill that Block has so carefully created and nurtured over the past six decades is now under attack by a Silicon Valley fintech company,” it said. We’ve reached out to Block, the other one, for comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Square changed its name to Block at the start of December. At the time, the company said it wanted a name that better reflected the expansion of its business beyond payments and the growing importance of blockchain technologies to its identity. Since its founding in 2009, Block’s business has expanded to include stock and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-square-free-stock-trades-cash-app.html"><ins>crypto trading</ins></a>, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/banking/loans"><ins>money lending</ins></a> and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-buys-control-of-tidal-142318706.html"><ins>music streaming</ins></a>.</p><p>Where things may get tricky in terms of a trademark infringement complaint is that Block <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/credit-karma-tax">bought Credit Karma&#39;s tax-prep business</a> in 2020. It plans to offer tax returns through its Cash App. In trademark cases, a court will look at similarities between the products and services two companies offer. It will also consider how the two may compete against one another in the future. Jack, if you&#39;re reading this: it&#39;s never been a better time to rebrand the company to &quot;Tesseract.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/h-and-r-block-sues-block-193019198.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">182ac5c9-5fad-4952-a9e3-b6cf0311a3a4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 19:30:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639682443</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T19:20:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-07/88459e50-a22e-11e9-a7fe-b33d7c5c6f79" width="5502" height="3668" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/88459e50-a22e-11e9-a7fe-b33d7c5c6f79" width="5502" height="3668" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucas Jackson / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square and CEO of Twitter, uses his phone to live cast during an event outside of the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate the IPO of Square Inc., in New York November 19, 2015.
