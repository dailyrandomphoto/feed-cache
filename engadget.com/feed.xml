Starting today, you can no longer purchase <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-05-nanoleaf-wall-tiles-sync-razer-gaming-chroma.html">Rhythm Light Panels</a> starter kits from the <a href="https://nanoleaf.me/en-CA/products/nanoleaf-light-panels/"><ins>company’s website</ins></a>. In a video it <a href="https://youtu.be/lU1LmaBl86o">uploaded to YouTube</a>, Nanoleaf said it now considers the device as a legacy product. It notes it will continue to support Light Panels within its mobile app “forever,” or “a very, very, very long time.”</p><div id="9a4ec146443449d2b99bba4a17c535ad"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lU1LmaBl86o?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In practice, that means you can continue to use the panels in conjunction with Nanoleaf’s group feature, allowing you to sync them with its current and future lights. For the time being, it doesn’t sound like the company plans to update the panels to add support for new features like Thread. We’ve reached out to find out if that’s the case.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Should you need replacement parts for your panels, Nanoleaf will offer those until the end of 2023. If you want to expand your current setup, the company has discounted expansion packs by 30 percent and accessories by 50 percent while supplies last. As you might imagine, not everyone is happy about the news.&nbsp;</p><p>“This is a mistake,” says one of the comments on the video the company released. “All Nanoleaf needed to do was release an updated controller that supports Thread to help the connection issues.” In both the video and on its website, Nanoleaf says part of the reason it’s retiring the Light Panels is that it feels it found a suitable successor in its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nanoleaf-adds-triangles-to-its-colorful-shape-light-panels-103342521.html"><ins>Shapes line</ins></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nanoleaf-retires-rhythm-light-panels-204440523.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8573846f-c592-4499-847a-e45bb227c3d4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 20:44:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642624486</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T20:34:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/aea94770-7965-11ec-afb9-954c6a64a79e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/aea94770-7965-11ec-afb9-954c6a64a79e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nanoleaf]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nanoleaf Light Panels]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nanoleaf Light Panels]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM aims to use hydrogen fuel cells for mobile power generators]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Automakers have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-23-hydrogen-fuel-cell-explainer.html">pursuing the dream of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles</a> for decades — who wouldn&#39;t want a car that runs on renewable hydrogen and only emits water vapor? But many challenges, from designing cars that can easily hold the fuel, to setting up reliable hydrogen distribution, have made it difficult to turn that dream into a reality. But what if you used those fuel cells to set up a remote EV charging station, or to replace a traditional gas or diesel generator for a large camp? That&#39;s what GM is planning to do with its HYDROTEC fuel cell technology, the <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0119-hydrotec.html">company announced today</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2a6b5de0-7965-11ec-8391-9e184bc110b3" style="height:1316;width:2000;" alt="GM fuel cell mobile power generator" data-uuid="d8ffca3e-d770-31a7-9ee2-86c167f2dc00"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GM</div></figure><p>GM&#39;s Mobile Power Generators, or MPGs, are pretty self descriptive: they&#39;d basically let you bring large amounts of electricity anywhere without burning fossil fuels, or expanding a local power grid. It could be useful for concerts, movie sets, or neighborhoods that frequently lose power. (In my town outside of Atlanta, almost everyone owns a gas generator to deal with storm-related outages.)&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement also makes plenty of sense for GM, as it&#39;s already bringing its fuel cell technology to <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jan/0127-navistar.html">trucking</a>, <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jun/0617-hydrotec.html">aerospace</a> and <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/jun/0615-wabtec.html">rail partners</a>. The company says the MPGs will be able to spit out 60 to 600 kilowatts without producing much noise or heat.</p><p>GM plans to show off an MPG-powered EV charging station in the middle of 2022, a project co-funded by the Michigan Economic Development Corporation and the U.S. Army. Additionally, the California Energy Commission is exploring how MPGs could help provide energy during power shutdowns. GM is also working together with Renewable Innovations to build the EMPOWER rapid charger, which could deliver fast EV charging to existing stations without the need for huge infrastructure improvements. Taking things to an even more extreme level, there&#39;s a large MPG implementation that could potentially power large military camps and heavy-duty equipment. (And as a bonus, those camps can actually use the water the MPG emits.)</p><p>While it&#39;ll likely be years before MPGs can actually deployed, it&#39;s heartening to see GM explore uses for fuel cells outside of cars. Battery-powered EVs have evolved so quickly that hydrogen-powered cars don&#39;t have much of a future (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-second-generation-mirai-hydrogen-fuel-cell-electric-vehicle-060056654.html">sorry, Toyota</a>). So it&#39;s about time we start considering other ways fuel cells could help.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-hydrotec-hydrogen-fuel-cell-power-generator-202526346.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b292db60-0c5d-44d0-9a47-c5a4aa7318fd</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 20:25:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642623927</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T20:25:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Renewable Energy & Energy Saving]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2a6b5de1-7965-11ec-81ad-aa410a11851b" width="2000" height="1005" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2a6b5de1-7965-11ec-81ad-aa410a11851b" width="2000" height="1005" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GM fuel cell mobile power generator]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GM fuel cell mobile power generator]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[President Biden signs memo to help improve military cybersecurity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>President Biden is following his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/white-house-eo-network-security-010757835.html">executive order on cybersecurity</a> with more concrete action. The leader has <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/19/fact-sheet-president-biden-signs-national-security-memorandum-to-improve-the-cybersecurity-of-national-security-department-of-defense-and-intelligence-community-systems/">signed</a> a memorandum aiming to improve digital security for the Defense Department, the intelligence community and national security systems. The notice sets firmer requirements, both for schedules and for the technology needed to lock down government data.</p><p>The memo lets the NSA require agencies to take &quot;specific actions&quot; in response to threats and security flaws, and asks the NSA to coordinate with Homeland Security on directives. Agencies will also have to identify their national security systems, report incidents and secure tools that transfer data between classified and unclassified systems. The President&#39;s move also sets timelines and guidance for implementing technologies required in the executive order, ranging from encryption to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-2-factor-140044867.html">multi-factor authentication</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Biden&#39;s move complements an order that was initially signed in response to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-captures-hacker-likely-responsible-for-colonial-pipeline-012541371.html">critical infrastructure cyberattacks</a>. In theory, this will tighten security at some of the most sensitive federal government institutions. As with the order, though, the memo can only accomplish so much without Congress&#39; support. Virginia Senator Mark Warner, for instance, used the signing to <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/pressreleases?ID=31242E15-8C6F-4C37-AEAB-16F580B48C20">ask Congress</a> to pass legislation requiring notices of critical infrastructure breaches within 72 hours.</p><p>The timing is apt, at least. The President&#39;s effort comes as tensions rise between Russia, the US and American allies, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ukraine-blames-russia-for-cyberattack-151210108.html">Ukraine blaming Russia</a> for a string of cyberattacks that knocked out government websites. The situation might not lead to outright cyberwarfare, but the US still has a strong incentive to close as many security holes as possible.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-memorandum-cybersecurity-defense-intelligence-195058392.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ecedc632-9ed4-4ef5-8ea0-a5ca71886611</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 19:50:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642624209</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T20:30:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/93f53bf0-795b-11ec-9ff3-8b1d83be1a09" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/93f53bf0-795b-11ec-9ff3-8b1d83be1a09" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US President Joe Biden speaks about how the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will rebuild the US and the progress made since he signed the bill into law, in the South Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC, on January 14, 2022.

What started as Google Apps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-29-google-for-work-has-a-new-name-g-suite.html"><ins>became G Suite</ins></a> and is now known as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-workspace-rebrand-gmail-logo-105013517.html"><ins>Workspace</ins></a>. Over that same timeframe, the company has offered just as many ways to access that software, announcing new subscription plans while doing away with older ones. It now plans to sunset a tier that had survived the suite’s most recent rebranding.</p><p>In an email spotted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/19/g-suite-legacy-free-edition/"><em><ins>9to5Google</ins></em></a>, the company told Workspace administrators it won’t offer G Suite legacy free edition as of <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/60217#faq&amp;zippy=%2Chow-does-the-upgrade-affect-my-current-g-suite-legacy-free-edition-subscription"><ins>July 1st, 2022</ins></a>. The company plans to transition those users to paid accounts starting on May 1st. Google says it will automatically select a subscription plan for users who don’t pick one on their own by the start of May, noting it will look at their current usage when making the decision. Any individual or organization the company migrates to a paid subscription plan automatically won’t be billed for at least two months. However, the company says it will suspend the accounts of individuals and organizations that don’t input their billing information by July 1st.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Business and enterprise Workspace accounts start at a monthly cost of $6 per user. The company will offer &quot;deep&quot; discounts to those affected by the decision. To be clear, if you&#39;re using Gmail, Docs, Sheets and other apps through a <a href="https://www.google.com/account/about/">free Google account</a>, you won&#39;t be affected by the move. What&#39;s more, Google will continue to offer free Workspace plans to <a href="https://www.google.com/nonprofits/workspace/compare/"><ins>nonprofits</ins></a> and schools that qualify for its <a href="https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_ca/products/workspace-for-education/"><ins>Fundamentals tier</ins></a>.

Its C-Band 5G services are live in &quot;limited parts&quot; of eight metro areas, including Detroit and Chicago as well as Austin, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston in Texas. Folks in three regions in Florida — Jacksonville, Orlando and South Florida — can also use AT&amp;T&#39;s C-Band network.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Verizon (Engadget&#39;s former parent company) says that 100 million more people will gain access to its 5G Ultra Wideband network this month in more than 1,700 cities, including C-Band coverage. So, most metro areas should have at least some C-Band 5G coverage from Verizon in the coming weeks.</p><p>The C-Band spectrum has more bandwidth than the low-band spectrum AT&amp;T and Verizon used in their previous 5G rollouts. That should enable faster download and upload speeds than earlier iterations of 5G. Verizon claims its C-Band 5G is up to 10 times faster than 4G LTE, with download speeds that have exceeded 1 Gbps in some areas.</p><p>AT&amp;T and Verizon initially planned to switch on C-Band 5G in December, but they pushed back the activation following concerns from the FAA and airlines. The companies <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-delay-5g-rollout-airports-203850079.html"><ins>said on Tuesday</ins></a> that, even though 40 other countries have enabled C-Band 5G without issue, they are voluntarily delaying the rollout near several airports. Earlier this month, the two said they&#39;d <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-5g-buffer-zones-airports-133305569.html"><ins>create buffer zones</ins></a> around 50 airports.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-verizon-c-band-5g-rollout-182958225.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2890bb92-e776-4be6-9e81-d595bda0edc2</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 18:29:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642617000</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T18:30:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e46300b0-7954-11ec-b3da-c0aa45c25a4d" width="3918" height="2616" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e46300b0-7954-11ec-b3da-c0aa45c25a4d" width="3918" height="2616" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SAN FRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA  - JANUARY 18: A United Airlines plane flies by a cellular tower as it takes off from San Francisco International Airport  on January 18, 2022 in San Francisco, California.

The video is, unsurprisingly, packed with gorgeous visuals while offering some details on what seems to be a solid expansion of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>&#39;s rich story.</p><div id="da8fe0a1d6264859b423b68a90c0b568"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UxDWGW7Z67I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;People are suffering. Soon, they&#39;ll starve,&quot; protagonist Aloy (Ashly Burch) says at the beginning of the trailer. &quot;The machines, meant to help us, are out of control. I have to find a way to fix it all. The answer is somewhere out in the Forbidden West.&quot; We soon learn that, in that part of the world, war is the order of the day, so Aloy clearly has another difficult journey ahead.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along with some familiar faces like Varl and Erend, there are some new characters in the trailer — both friendly and hostile ones. Angela Bassett plays one of the antagonists, Regalla. She&#39;s a rebel leader who &quot;seeks to slaughter all those who&#39;ve wronged her&quot; and has the ability to control the machines, granted to her by a returning character. The three-minute clip closes with a glimpse of a mysterious character named Tilda. Guerrilla Games told <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/19/breaking-down-the-new-horizon-forbidden-west-trailer-with-guerrilla-games"><em>Game Informer</em></a> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-matrix-resurrections-review-160043378.html"><em>The Matrix</em></a> star Carrie-Anne Moss plays her.</p><p>Of course, some of the machines Aloy will battle appear in the clip too. Among them is a terrifying, giant cobra-rattlesnake hybrid called the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/27/horizon-forbidden-west-introducing-the-mighty-slitherfang">Slitherfang</a>, which can spit streams of acid in her direction.</p><p>Overall, the trailer offers another tantalizing look at a hotly anticipated game. Given that an unfinished build <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-leak-185242744.html">reportedly leaked</a> earlier this month, it&#39;s best for fans to tread carefully to avoid spoilers before <em>Horizon Forbidden West </em>arrives on February 18th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-story-trailer-carrie-anne-moss-ps4-ps5-172519361.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7bdf299-75c3-43a8-8205-cbf2348035e0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 17:25:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642612355</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T17:12:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/396cae00-7949-11ec-996c-b44150481fc9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/396cae00-7949-11ec-996c-b44150481fc9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Guerrilla Games/PlayStation Studios ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Carrie-Anne Moss as Tilda in Horizon Forbidden West.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Horizon Forbidden West]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cheeky hack-and-slash RPG ‘Nobody Saves the World’ is available now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After being pushed back from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nobody-saves-the-world-annoucement-185546511.html"><ins>original 2021 release date</ins></a>, Drinkbox Studios’ playful shape-shifting RPG is available at last on Xbox and PC.</p><p>From the makers of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-10-guacamelee-review.html"><em><ins>Guacamelee</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-05-severed-gets-a-lavish-ps-vita-physical-release.html"><em><ins>Severed</ins></em></a>, <em>Nobody Saves the World</em> is crammed with Drinkbox’s signature self-aware humor and vivid art style while paying homage to classic RPGs from the 90s. Inspired by Final Fantasy Tactic’s Job system, the game’s titular hero Nobody can shapeshift into 18 different off-kilter forms including an egg, slug, and even a bodybuilder to complete quests and clear out dungeons.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="26ea15772bc7440ebee7b930ceeddd93"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H_E1RhtzDHM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The game’s overworld and top-down aesthetic will be immediately familiar to fans of other classics like <em>Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past. </em>Drinkbox also tacks new-school twists on the genre with clever level design and quirky combat that includes moves like the magician’s confetti bomb. But the fun really amps up once you get the ability to mix-and-match attacks between forms, which unlocks more than a hundred combos to help dispatch foes.</p><p>If the game’s gorgeous 2D sprites weren’t enough to catch your attention, <em>Nobody Saves the World</em> also features a soundtrack from composer Jim Guthrie, whose music has been featured in titles such as <em>Superbother: Sword &amp; Sworcery</em>, <em>Indie Game: The Movie</em>, and others.</p><p><em>Nobody Saves the World</em> is available now on Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X and PC (Steam) for $25, or via subscription as part of Xbox Games Pass on Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, and Xbox Cloud streaming.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nobody-saves-the-world-out-now-on-xbox-and-pc-171042189.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e49668b0-15e0-4c5c-888b-cbeb9cd84818</guid><dc:creator>Sam Rutherford</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 17:10:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642614266</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T17:44:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Sam Rutherford]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/500d38a0-7949-11ec-b7c1-7c9cf8ec1c2e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/500d38a0-7949-11ec-b7c1-7c9cf8ec1c2e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drinkbox Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot from hack-and-slash RPG Nobody Saves the World.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nobody saves the world combat]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's WeWork drama 'WeCrashed' premieres March 18th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is nearly ready to release its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-wecrashed-series-190134468.html">tale of WeWork&#39;s tragic fall</a>.

The eight-episode drama stars Jared Leto as former WeWork CEO Adam Neumann, who wielded hype to earn a $47 billion valuation only to lose most of it (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-wework-ceo-john-legere-t-mobile-report.html">and his job</a>) when the IPO process revealed ugly financials and leadership. Anne Hathaway plays Adam&#39;s wife Rebekah, who served as an executive (including the head of WeGrow) and whose relationship with Adam was &quot;at the center of it all,&quot; according to Apple.</p><p>The trailer sets expectations quickly. The Neumanns portrayed by Leto and Hathaway are full of overly grand visions, portraying WeWork as nothing less than the future, a &quot;movement&quot; aiming to &quot;elevate the world&#39;s consciousness.&quot; The clip also highlights the cult-like devotion to the company and its notoriously summer camp-like retreats. It&#39;s not certain how well the performances will hold up across a whole series, but Apple at least seems to understand how WeWork&#39;s reality was never going to match the buzz.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t the first streaming take on WeWork&#39;s rise and sudden decline. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-wework-documentary-adam-neumann-170036642.html">Hulu&#39;s 2021 documentary</a> was an imperfect but prominent take on the Neumann couple. Apple&#39;s effort clearly has star power, however, and the behind-the-camera talent has experience with well-received titles like <em>Little America</em> and <em>This is Us</em>. If nothing else, it&#39;s clear Apple hasn&#39;t given up its TV+ strategy of counting on big names to draw in viewers, even if the projects are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60050996">slightly unusual</a>.</p><div id="a7f3ecc40d254d44854212805b2df565"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VAuhT5241h8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-wework-series-wecrashed-release-date-164250999.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4099c376-fab7-4207-82af-d7534c003a83</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 16:42:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642617709</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T18:41:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/77a7d0f0-793f-11ec-8d3e-1e3501006e4a" width="1920" height="1075" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/77a7d0f0-793f-11ec-8d3e-1e3501006e4a" width="1920" height="1075" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway in Apple TV+ series 'We Crashed']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway in Apple TV+ series 'We Crashed']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon gives its ‘Lord of the Rings’ series a redundant name]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s The Lord of the Rings series is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-series-release-date-184156740.html">scheduled to debut on Prime Video in September</a>, which might just be far enough away to get used to the unwieldy title.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/undersea-cable-fault-could-cut-off-tonga-rest-world-weeks-2022-01-18/"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22891031/tonga-volcano-eruption-broke-undersea-internet-cable-repair"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the Tonga government has <a href="https://twitter.com/ConsulateKoT/status/1483384039826464768">warned</a> internet access is &quot;down&quot; following damage to the lone undersea fiber optic cable keeping the archipelago online. While the country didn&#39;t provide an initial estimate, the Southern Cross Cable Network&#39;s Craige Sloots told <em>Reuters</em> it might take as long as two weeks to repair the cable &quot;all things going well.&quot;</p><p>It will take the repair ship up to nine days to travel from Papua New Guinea to Tonga, according to Sloots. The timing for the repair will also hinge on safety clearance and any lingering activity from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&#39;apai volcano. The 514-mile cable is secured through a Fiji relay.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tonga has been somewhat prepared for incidents like this. It struck a 15-year agreement for satellite internet access with Kacific in 2019 after damage to the underwater cable. However, <em>ZDNet</em><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kacific-waiting-for-tongan-contract-activation-to-supply-satellite-services-post-eruption/">learned</a> a contract dispute with Kacific kept that access from being activated.

While many countries connect to the rest of the world <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-subsea-cable-grace-hopper-london-spain-132503991.html">through undersea cabling</a>, these more distant areas are frequently dependent on either a very limited cable network or expensive satellite service that can degrade in bad weather.

Nowadays, it&#39;s not just patties that can do a convincing impersonation of animal products, and it&#39;s not just Impossible Foods. Between Impossible and its biggest competitor, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/beyond%20meat/">Beyond Meat</a>, we&#39;ve also seen plant-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-foods-chicken-nuggets-190923352.html">chicken nuggets</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-sausage-nationwide-restaurants-yelp-diner-160015325.html">sausage</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-foods-plant-based-pork-restaurants-us-hong-kong-singapore-233051113.html">pork</a>, &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/beyond-meat-chicken-kfc-nationwide-162015106.html">KFC</a>&quot; and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/taco-bell-beyond-meat-2021-222304025.html">taco meat</a>. But you don&#39;t often hear about attempts to mimic a different animal-based product: milk.</p><p>And when you do hear of plant-based milks, it&#39;s more likely to be dairy alternatives like almond milk, soy milk or oat milk. Even then, it&#39;s rare for a dairy-free version to taste like the real thing. That’s exactly the selling point of Silk’s new line of plant-based milk, Nextmilk. It will be available in both full fat and reduced fat versions (MSRP is $4.99 for a 59-ounce carton). It’s going on sale today in grocery stores like Target, Kroger, Publix and HEB, among others.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I tried a sample of <a href="https://goto.target.com/QOGXXM">Silk’s Nextmilk</a> last week and while it’s tasty, I wasn’t fooled into thinking it tastes like cow&#39;s milk. It tastes more like a richer, fattier version of oat milk. It does have a similar creamy mouthfeel to regular milk and the taste is a little closer to dairy than other plant-based milks I’ve tried, but it doesn’t quite replace dairy for me.</p><p>The ingredients list reflect what I tasted: It consists primarily of oat milk, plus smaller proportions of coconut milk, coconut oil, soy protein isolate, chicory root extract, cane sugar, sunflower oil, a vitamin and mineral blend, sea salt, locust bean gum, gellan gum, sunflower lecithin, soy lecithin and “natural flavor.”</p><p>Still, it’s quite delicious, and it might be close enough to dairy for some people. When eaten with cereal or as an accompaniment to cookies, for example, I thought Nextmilk was a more than acceptable substitute. It also mixes well in coffee and tea. “Silk Nextmilk was specially formulated to meet dairy-lovers’ taste expectations through a remarkably delicious blend of plants that are designed to deliver on key attributes of dairy milk, like taste and texture,&#39;&#39; a Danone (Silk’s parent company) spokesperson told Engadget.</p><p>Additionally, Danone says that Nextmilk can be used as a one-to-one alternative to traditional dairy milk in recipes. At the same time, however, the company is also working on another product called So Delicious Wondermilk, which arrives next month and was specifically developed for culinary purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>“While Silk Nextmilk is meant for everyday dairy lovers and offers great versatility [...] Wondermilk beverages were developed with culinary-focused consumers in mind and taste great in recipes,” the spokesperson said. When it arrives, Wondermilk will only be available through natural food channels like Whole Foods and Sprouts.&nbsp;</p><p>Danone is not the first to attempt a dairy-free alternative that tastes closer to real milk. Impossible Foods, the company behind the Impossible Burger, is also working on this, with a product tentatively called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-milk-154404741.html">Impossible Milk</a>. However, its availability is still unknown.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/silk-nextmilk-150024732.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f5f7bcde-db66-4dcb-9cf3-0cb90c2f3ed1</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 15:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642600278</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:51:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nutrition]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/990e4200-78cd-11ec-bdbd-acd7d27f4437" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/990e4200-78cd-11ec-bdbd-acd7d27f4437" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Silk Nextmilk]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Silk Nextmilk]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Backbone One made cloud gaming on the iPhone feel natural]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whether it’s Xbox Cloud gaming, Stadia, PlayStation Remote Play or just a very severe addiction to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-arcade-games-140053796.html">Apple Arcade</a>, gamepads are a better way to play many games on your smartphone of choice. Normally that means using some kind of smartphone clip to attach your phone to your existing controller, propping up your phone and hoping for the best, or choosing from an increasing selection of controllers that snap directly onto your phone. Instead of demanding compatible phone cases or separate pieces that connect either side of the phone, the $100 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Backbone One" href="https://amzn.to/33uO8kp">Backbone One</a> is a single-piece controller that extends to fit it.</p><p>Unlike the Razer Kishi, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-kishi-smartphone-game-controller-android-review-150009052.html">we tested in detail here</a>, the One is a single device with a telescopic backplate that fits around any iPhone. (With some help: the One isn’t compatible with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone 13 Pro</a>. Backbone has, however, started providing a soft rubberized adapter that slides into the controller, ensuring the latest, bigger iPhones fit snugly and securely.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10572460-7925-11ec-b4bb-c61945547d2b" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Backbone One controller review" data-uuid="9a93d5c7-60a2-3f21-8b7c-6c96fefb3420"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget/Mat Smith</div></figure><p>So why invest in another controller for your phone when most mainstream console gamepads you probably already own already do the job? There are a few reasons. Backbone One, with its direct Lightning connection, sidesteps the extra jeopardy that comes with Bluetooth-connected controllers, which introduce another latency bump in the road. The company has wisely included a charger pass-through (gaming can burn through your battery) so you can keep your phone plugged in as you play.</p><p>The device has a subtle matte black finish, with two collar buttons on each side, a four-button layout on the right side (X, Y, A, B), a slightly-too-spongy d-pad on the left and an analog stick on each side. The sticks feel a little looser than others I’ve used, but they’re accurate and comfortable.</p><p>Backbone struck a deal with Microsoft, offering a one-month trial of Xbox’s Game Pass Ultimate for new Backbone owners. It said so on the box, it says it in the app, and it’ll say it in an email if you register the controller. You will get the hint.</p><p>The button layout does lean more towards Xbox gamers, but my PlayStation muscle memory meant I didn’t have too many issues using the One to play my PS5 remotely – just the usual drawbacks of playing with a controller that isn’t a DualSense, with its unique tricks and features. Using the touchpad will mean reaching for a section of the iPhone screen, while you’re not going to get any haptic feedback from the triggers or controller itself.</p><p>There are a handful of buttons in addition to the stable gaming ones. The orange button launches Backbone’s own game portal (part of the BackBone iOS app), while others offer screen and video sharing shortcuts or what you’d expect when pressing start or menu on console controllers.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c5fd10eb1199462a9bf7e94a78ba500b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10572461-7925-11ec-bffb-f879e7253d34" alt="Backbone One controller review" data-uuid="3da1c316-a661-397c-85c3-c525f0d3bdb8"></section><p>The controller’s namesake, the spring-loaded backplate, ensures that once your phone is in place, it all feels solid and unified. The controls aren’t going to pull away, nor is there a chance of your phone slipping out. The more I spent playing through <em>Alan Wake</em>, then <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html"><em>Deathloop</em></a>, as well as Apple Arcade titles like <em>Fallen Knight </em>and<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-hironobu-sakaguchi-fantasian-interview-apple-arcade-150022942.html"><em>Fantasian</em></a>, the more it started to blur into a handheld – one with a high-resolution OLED screen. Unfortunately, you will have to remove any cases to ensure it fits inside the controller chassis.</p><p>The companion app has a few useful tricks. It can capture, edit and upload gaming content, and it’s pretty intuitive. I don’t usually capture gameplay unless it’s for work, but I’ve already used Backbone’s implementation to send short clips to friends. The company has also announced a Backbone+ subscription service that integrates Twitch streaming and even enables cable connections for keyboards and more. (You’ll get a free year of the service when buying the controller.) There’s also the ability to join chat groups and lobbies, populated with other Backbone gamers, but it’s not particularly vibrant in comparison to Discord, Reddit or other existing gamer spaces.</p><p></p><p>The app also serves as a games library, of sorts, of all the games you can play with the Backbone One, across Xbox, Stadia, Apple Arcade and individual games in Apple’s App Store. Unfortunately, it’s literally all the compatible games, including unremarkable game clones, and Xbox and Stadia titles you might not even have a subscription for. It’s a shame the app couldn’t interface with which games I’d already installed – which would be impossible for PlayStation Remote Play, admittedly. Tapping the Backbone button during a game will log the title into the library for more convenient access next time, at least. There’s deeper functionality here, but your mileage may vary. It will show recommendations of popular titles, but it’s the incredibly familiar sights of <em>Among Us, Genshin Impact </em>and<em> Minecraft.</em></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10577281-7925-11ec-bdcd-e9fe5ede707a" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Backbone One controller review" data-uuid="e01f2dd7-b395-337c-b999-4152d836ba30"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget/Mat Smith</div></figure><p>The Backbone One is a capable iPhone gamepad, so much in fact that sometimes I actively choose to play Stadia and even remote-play PlayStation when I’m in another room. It is, however, an expensive one. $100 can buy a couple of PS5 controllers, or an entire box of third-party Bluetooth gamepads and smartphone clips.</p><p>But for that price, you get a slick experience that marries well with your iPhone. Over the holidays, when I visited my family, I was able to effortlessly (aside from reading the tiny text) play <em>Deathloop</em> while being hundreds of miles away from my console. Like several existing split gamer pads for smartphones, it’s like a tiny Switch. The app also tries to pool together all your iOS gaming experiences in a single place, which is a nice idea, even if Backbone doesn’t quite nail the execution.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/backbone-one-ios-gamepad-review-143015385.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">868c6867-d0b7-498e-ae23-9183bfb0866a</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:30:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642600735</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:59:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10577281-7925-11ec-bdcd-e9fe5ede707a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e44f8410-7925-11ec-bcf6-da9b33ed53cc" width="1716" height="1144" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/ Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Backbone One]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Backbone One]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix's latest mobile games include an open-world card battler]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix is still relatively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-games-mobile-stranger-things-android-ios-171232076.html">new to mobile gaming</a>, but that isn&#39;t stopping it from quickly releasing new titles. <em>What&#39;s on Netflix</em><a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-launches-two-new-mobile-games-arcanium-rise-of-akhan-and-krispee-street/">notes</a> the streaming service has unveiled two new titles for subscribers.

There are many more budget-friendly robot vacuums available today than there were even just a couple of years ago, and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iRobot&#39;s Roomba 694" href="https://amzn.to/3rwPHX1">iRobot&#39;s Roomba 694</a> is one of the better ones we&#39;ve tried. Normally priced at $274, the affordable robo-vac is even cheaper right now on Amazon where it&#39;s $95 off and down to $179. That&#39;s the same price we saw during the Black Friday shopping season last year, so if you missed the gadget when it was previously on sale, you have another chance to grab it now.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3rwPHX1" id="e4e46e5ceba74cfb90f012066527e62a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba 694 at Amazon - $179</a><p>This is one of iRobot&#39;s entry-level vacuums with a three-button design, mobile app connectivity and the ability to clean both hard and carpeted surfaces well. It earned a spot in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a> for those reasons — not only does it do a good job puttering around your home, sucking up dirt and debris along the way, but we also like that you can control it using the on-device buttons or the companion mobile app. iRobot&#39;s app is pretty straightforward, so even if you&#39;re a newbie to the world of autonomous cleaning robots, it shouldn&#39;t be difficult to figure out. The app also lets you set cleaning schedules, which tell the Roomba to automatically clean on certain days of the week and at specific times. The Roomba 694 is also compatible with Alexa and the Google Assistant, so you can control it with voice commands, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Roomba 694 is a great option if you want to introduce a robo-vac into your home without dropping too much money. iRobot also has a number of more advanced machines if you&#39;re looking to invest in a vacuum with more power and smarts. The new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba j7+" href="https://amzn.to/3Gy7JhO">Roomba j7+</a> is on sale for $599 right now, which is $250 off and the best price we&#39;ve seen. It has 10x the suction power of the 694 plus Precision View Navigation with obstacle avoidance, the latter of which is the reason why iRobot dubbed the machine its &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">poop-detecting</a>&quot; robot. It also comes with a clean base, so the robo-vac will automatically empty its bin into that base after every job so you don&#39;t have to.</p><p>Similarly, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba s9+" href="https://amzn.to/3GDnbcA">Roomba s9+</a> is also $250 off and down to $849. It has 40x the suction of a standard Roomba, a design that can more easily clean in room corners and an included clean base. While it&#39;s probably overkill for most people, it&#39;s the model to get if you want one of the highest-end robot vacuums around.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Gy7JhO" id="65c4acf847454d5a8b4a7d2093f4b247" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba j7+ at Amazon - $599</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GDnbcA" id="44ecdeff9f1249feb27819957ab4be7c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba S9+ at Amazon - $849</a><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobots-roomba-694-is-back-down-to-a-record-low-of-179-140530376.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3943a458-f33c-43c8-b2e9-ba37d414b7dc</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:05:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642600730</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:59:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 694]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 694]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Valorant' will let players mute words they don't want to appear in text chat]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;d rather not mute certain <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valorant-mobile-annoucement-130018738.html"><em>Valorant</em></a> players even though they occasionally make sketchy comments in chat, a new update could solve the problem.

The new feature could help you avoid using that nuclear option, allowing for a more bespoke experience. It&#39;ll also let you protect yourself based on your own tastes instead of relying on Riot&#39;s global watchlists.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Riot plans to use player muted word lists to &quot;make the chat less toxic by comparing them across regions, and using the data we collect to improve our own detections of bad words.&quot; It noted, for instance, that its own filters could catch &quot;Riot&quot; but not necessarily &quot;R1ot&quot; or &quot;R!ot.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Early last year, <em>Valorant</em> rolled out new <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/news/dev/valorant-behavior-detection-and-penalty-updates/">behavior detection and penalty updates</a> that included measures for chat-based offenses. The rules allowed mods a bit more leeway to give warnings and comms bans, or issue game and extended game bans if required. By contrast, the muted words list feature gives the player control, even if it&#39;s just to mute words or phrases you find annoying or repetitive.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with the muted words list, the latest patch boosts the price for the Ares weapon while changing some characteristics. Riot also tweaked Melee to make aiming more reliable, while fixing some bugs around weapons, esports features and performance. Patch 4.01 is now rolling out globally.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valorant-will-let-players-specify-muted-words-they-dont-want-to-appear-in-game-140019569.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee629e27-c31a-4590-a1ff-0221830f91a5</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642597308</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:02:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/00dbf6e0-7921-11ec-bffb-e479658cde7d" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/00dbf6e0-7921-11ec-bffb-e479658cde7d" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Valorant' will let players mute words they don't want to appear in the game]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Valorant' will let players mute words they don't want to appear in the game]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple now requires verification for education discounts in the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has closed a loophole in the US that allowed buyers to take advantage of its education pricing even if they&#39;re not actually a student or a teacher.

Prior to this change, Apple doesn&#39;t require its customers in the US to verify their status unlike its stores for other locations such as the UK that have long required UNiDAYS authentication. It didn&#39;t even ask for a .edu email address.

Once they&#39;re in, they can buy what they want, so long as it&#39;s within the device limits for the promotion.

The aim is to &quot;simplify the Web3 user experience that is often bewildering for mainstream users,&quot; Opera EVP Jorgen Arnensen said in statement.&nbsp;</p><p>A key feature is the built-in non-custodial wallet that will support blockchains including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Celo and Nervos from the get-go. It also announced partnerships with Polygon and others. The idea is to let you access your crypto without the need for any extensions, with the option of using third-party wallets as well. You can purchase cryptocurrencies via a fiat to crypto on-ramp, swap crypto directly in-wallet, send and receive it and check your wallet balance. It even has a secure clipboard that ensures other apps can&#39;t data when you copy/paste.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The other primary function is support for Web3, aka blockchain-based decentralized internet, aka the buzzy new thing among crypto enthusiasts (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-web3-rant-175156845.html">skeptics</a>). On top of providing extra security via blockchain encryption, it allows users to access things like GameFi &quot;where you can earn as you play your way through all sorts of metaverses,&quot; Opera notes. It also offers a &quot;Crypto Corner&quot; with the latest blockchain news that also &quot;lets you grow your Web3 skills,&quot; according to Opera.&nbsp;</p><p>Opera&#39;s rival Mozilla recently announced it would accept cryptocurrency donations, but was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-stops-accepting-crypto-donations-following-outrage-over-climate-impact-131619769.html">hit by a backlash</a> from users including co-founder Jamie Zawinski over the environmental impact of blockchain. Perhaps anticipating a similar reaction, Opera said it was working toward implementing the more energy-efficient Etherium Layer 2 standard &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot;</p><p>Other companies like Ubisoft jumping on the blockchain train with NFTs and other offerings have been hit by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-de-lists-overwhelmingly-disliked-nft-announcement-video/">similar criticism</a>. However, Opera at least gives its users a choice with multiple browser options, as it also offers its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opera-chromebook-browser-070050771.html">regular Opera browser</a> and one that&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-11-opera-built-a-browser-just-for-gamers.html">dedicated to gamers</a>.

However, the new study found that the astronauts&#39; bodies destroyed three million red blood cells per second during six month missions. &quot;We thought we knew about space anemia, and we did not,&quot; said Trudel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A full year after returning to Earth from the ISS, the astronauts&#39; red blood cell levels had not returned to pre-flight levels, according to the study in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01637-7"><em>Nature</em></a>. &quot;If you are on your way to Mars and... can&#39;t keep up&quot; with red blood cell production, &quot;you could be in serious trouble,&quot; said Trudel. That wouldn&#39;t necessarily cause problems in a zero gravity environment, but could become an issue once astronauts arrive on Mars or when they return to Earth.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>[Anemia] is a primary efffect of going to space.</p></blockquote><p>The researchers said that anemia could even be an issue for space tourism, if the potential travelers are at risk for anemia. The study also noted that &quot;current exercise and nutritional countermeasures of modern space travel did not prevent hemolysis and post-flight anemia&quot; with the astronauts tested.&nbsp;</p><p>The study, <a href="https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/1618">first announced in 2016</a>, drew from <a href="https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/1618">data gathered</a> during Expedition 10 and 11 missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2004 and 2005. Anemia is defined as a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, a condition that can result in pallor and weariness and affect endurance and strength.</p><p>The study didn&#39;t say how such issues could be directly resolved, but suggested that doctors focus on anemia-related issues when testing candidates. &quot;Medical screening of future astronauts and space tourists might benefit from a preflight profiling of globin gene and modifiers,&quot; according to the study. It also suggested that post-landing monitoring should cover conditions affected by anemia and hemolysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anemia-could-make-space-travel-to-mars-a-challenge-study-finds-103522230.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a917cb7d-b6ac-4881-8d09-bcfe2a7cd104</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 10:35:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642587219</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T10:13:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6b08be0-7907-11ec-bffd-7cf065a4b8a0" width="2048" height="1363" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6b08be0-7907-11ec-bffd-7cf065a4b8a0" width="2048" height="1363" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anemia could make space travel to Mars a challenge, study finds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anemia could make space travel to Mars a challenge, study finds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US labor board reconsiders rule that allow gag orders in arbitration agreements]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2020, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/arbitration-clauses-requiring-confidentiality-are-ok-nlrb-says">ruled</a> that companies requiring employees to go into arbitration to settle disputes can add a confidentiality clause to the agreement. Now, the agency is rethinking its decision. The NLRB has <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-invites-briefs-on-mandatory-arbitration-clauses">posted</a> an invitation for the public to submit briefs on whether it should adopt a new legal standard to determine if gag orders in mandatory arbitration agreements violate Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, as well as other legal issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Section 8(a)(1) <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1">states</a> that it&#39;s unfair labor practice for employers to &quot;interfere with, restrain or coerce employees&quot; when it comes to exercising their right to self-organization. As <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/labor-board-to-rethink-worker-gag-orders-in-arbitration-pacts"><em>Bloomberg Law</em></a> states, this could lead to arbitration agreements that are more worker-friendly, since the absence of confidentiality clauses means they can talk about their issue publicly and ask help from the appropriate administrative agencies if needed.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Private arbitrations that force workers to keep mum about their issue and the proceedings are a controversial practice. They prevent workers who may be dealing with the same problem to connect, thereby preventing the public and the rest of a company&#39;s workers to see emerging patterns. Companies have landed in hot water for forcing issues like sexual harassment into arbitration in the past, that some have chosen to end the practice. Over 150 Riot Games employees <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-07-riot-games-walk-out-sexism-lawsuits-arbitration.html">staged</a> a walkout after the developer forced the women who filed sexism lawsuits against it into arbitration in 2019. In the same year, Google decided to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-09-google-walkout-response.html"> end forced arbitrations</a> for sexual harassment cases after a walkout involving 20,000 workers. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-sexual-harassment-assault-forced-arbitration-guests-hosts-153010488.html">Airbnb</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-151427460.html">Activision Blizzard</a> are two other companies that decided to stop forced arbitration for sexual harassment cases.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nlrb-reconsiders-rule-gag-orders-arbitration-agreements-095009215.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e3559cc-36b0-488d-bef9-90a2523b322d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 09:50:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642585458</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T09:44:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/50281340-78ff-11ec-b7ef-95f69962ace1" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/50281340-78ff-11ec-b7ef-95f69962ace1" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[gesrey via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The document Arbitration Agreement is ready for signing.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The document Arbitration Agreement is ready for signing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon sued by family of employee killed in Illinois tornado warehouse collapse]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is being sued by the family of delivery driver Austin McEwan who died in the Edwardsville, Illinois warehouse <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-tornado-edwardsville-illinois-deaths-climate-220437155.html">struck by a tornado</a> last month, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/amazon-sued-by-family-of-delivery-driver-killed-inside-collapsed-warehouse/"><em>CNET</em></a> has reported. The lawsuit alleges that Amazon was negligent, citing the fact that it told people to keep working through extreme weather warnings. It also makes claims of negligence against contractors who helped build the warehouse.&nbsp;</p><p>McEwan was one of six people killed when the warehouse roof was hit by a tornado and collapsed. The family of victim Deandre Morrow has also retained a lawyer. &quot;Sadly, it appears that Amazon placed profits first during this holiday season instead of the safety of our son and the other five,&quot; said McEwan&#39;s mother, Alice McKewan in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYl-fRc8M0Q">press conference</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Severe weather watches are common in this part of the country and, while precautions are taken, are not cause for most businesses to close down,&quot; Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel told <em>CNET</em> in a statement. &quot;We believe our team did the right thing as soon as a warning was issued.&quot; The company said that the warehouse was built four years ago in accordance with building code requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>Edwardsville is in a region known as Wind Zone IV, a part of the US most at risk from tornadoes. The National Weather Service <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSStLouis/status/1468877633400180737">warned</a> of a tornado threat 36 hours before they struck, and the morning before the storms, it <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSStLouis/status/1469272060157304833">cautioned</a> of the &quot;likely threat&quot; of &quot;damaging winds in excess of 60 mph.&quot;</p><p>During the same incident, an Amazon dispatcher <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-dispatcher-screenshots-edwardsville-illinois-010215086.html">pressured a driver</a> to deliver packages amid tornado alarms, threatening her with termination. Amazon said that the dispatcher &quot;didn&#39;t follow the standard safety practice&quot; and should have directed the driver to seek shelter. Meanwhile, Democrats have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-warehouse-tornado-democrats-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-153129082.html">pressed Amazon</a> for details on the warehouse deaths, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.12.20%20Letter%20to%20Amazon%20re.%20Edwardsville,%20IL%20warehouse%20collapse.pdf">saying in a letter</a> that the incident &quot;fit a larger pattern&quot; of Amazon putting safety at risk &quot;in everyday situations and emergencies alike.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sued-by-family-of-employee-killed-in-warehouse-tornado-collapse-085656743.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">68c9d07d-315e-4553-b949-e939472c1795</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 08:56:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642582616</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T08:57:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Natural Phenomena]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/989d56f0-78fd-11ec-b7f3-fec76fb10c06" width="3300" height="2475" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/989d56f0-78fd-11ec-b7f3-fec76fb10c06" width="3300" height="2475" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lawrence Bryant / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon crew on lifts document the damage from the tornado that hit an Amazon distribution centre where the roof collapsed in Edwardsville, Illinois, U.S. December 13, 2021.
