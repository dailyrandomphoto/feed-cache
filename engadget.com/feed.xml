The updates include more prominent placement of the “scan” feature — now located directly under the camera’s shutter button — and new capabilities that will suggest lenses and music based on your surroundings.</p><p>Snap has been experimenting with visual search, called “scan” since 2019. The feature allows Snapchat users to identify plants and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-13-theres-shazam-in-my-snapchat.html"><ins>music</ins></a>, solve math problems, and scan <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-scan-food-and-wine-labels-130019011.html"><ins>food and wine</ins></a> labels with the in-app camera. But up until now, much of this functionality was easily overlooked as it required a few extra taps to access. With the update now rolling out, “scan” visible whenever the camera is open.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Snapchat’s also adding a few new features it previewed earlier this year, like the ability to <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/new-ar-tools-and-camera-experiences-for-snapchatters-creators-and-businesses"><ins>shop for outfits </ins></a>by pointing the camera at articles of clothing. It’s also adding Camera Shortcuts, which will suggest a combination of augmented reality lenses and music based on your surroundings. For example, pointing the camera at your pet may suggest AR lenses meant to work with dogs and music to go with your clip.</p><p>Though Snap has been working on its “scan” capabilities for some time, the fact that it’s now making the feature much more prominent underscores how big a priority it is for the company. Snap has also integrated scanning abilities into its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-spectacles-augmented-reality-180101040.html"><ins>AR Spectacles,</ins></a> which can similarly suggest lenses based on what’s around you (unlike previous versions of Spectacles, the newest ones aren’t for sale just yet). Visual search also help Snap compete for creative talent with rivals like TikTok and Instagram (which also happens to be working on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-visual-search-instagram-shopping-190323553.html"><ins>its own</ins></a> visual search feature). The company told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642017/snapchat-scan-feature-ar-camera-visual-search?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> that it’s working on adding camera shortcuts to Spotlight to make it easier for people to riff on other users’ clips.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-scan-features-visual-search-192454428.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93138589-a9e4-4335-a47d-6b6db99eb8fe</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 19:24:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630005894</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T19:24:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6bd543d0-06a2-11ec-8bea-7e715e4b2511" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6bd543d0-06a2-11ec-8bea-7e715e4b2511" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Snap]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Snapchat is adding new "Camera Shortcuts" to scan.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[snapchat scan]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube will finally roll out picture-in-picture mode to all iOS users]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube is making good on its promise to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-app-ios-picture-in-picture-190533676.html">bring picture-in-picture viewing to iOS users</a>. <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/youtube-to-roll-out-picture-in-picture-viewing-for-all-u-s-ios-users-starting-with-premium-subscribers/">reports</a> that YouTube is promising PiP viewing to all iPhone and iPad users in the US, starting with volunteers using Premium.

According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/nes-and-snes-designer-lance-barr-is-retiring-from-ninte-1847561525"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, NES and SNES designer Lance Barr has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/08/the_designer_of_the_nes_and_snes_has_retired_from_nintendo_after_almost_40_years">retired</a> from Nintendo after 38 years and eight months at the company. Although relatively few know his name, he may have played a key role in obtaining mainstream acceptance for Nintendo and reinvigorating the video game industry in the US.</p><p>Barr joined Nintendo in a part-time role in December 1982, but he made his biggest mark when he was asked to design the outside of the NES to make the Famicom more palatable for American audiences. As requested, he made it look like it belonged next to a stereo system (complete with a VHS-style cartridge loader) compared to the &quot;soft&quot; Japanese model. The console&#39;s final look was rushed, though — while the prototype NES at CES was a sleek wireless machine, Barr and his team spent an hour reworking the device based on both a poor CES reaction and cost-cutting engineering demands. One of the most recognizable pieces of electronics in the past four decades was the product of a quick rework, in other words.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Barr was influential well beyond those two early consoles. He designed key NES accessories, including the Zapper light gun and NES Max. And while Nintendo headquarters took the design reins in the mid-1990s, Barr left his stamp on the 2000s as well — he was involved in the design of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-10-25-nintendo-wii-shipments-end-europe.html">the Wii</a> and its legendary Nunchuk add-on controller.</p><p>In that light, Barr helped shape Nintendo&#39;s overall hardware design language: simple, sturdy and instantly recognizable. Nintendo appears to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-october-sales-053456267.html">in good hands</a> without Barr, but his departure still marks the end of a long and important era.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nes-snes-designer-lance-barr-retires-145657155.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ae46412-2468-4f23-8f9b-3ce730aa0062</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 14:56:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629989775</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T14:56:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/19515170-0676-11ec-bf78-003ce28e17e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/19515170-0676-11ec-bf78-003ce28e17e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jason Leung on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NES game console]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NES game console]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HP Pavilion Aero review: HP's lightest laptop yet deserves a closer look]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HP, the world’s second-largest PC vendor by market share, says that the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Pavilion Aero 13" href="https://fave.co/3B6S9Xp">Pavilion Aero 13</a> is designed for Generation Z.

This is actually a pretty nice laptop, but I doubt it’s top on any Zoomer’s wish list.</p><h3><strong>Hardware</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b6a11f90-00eb-11ec-beef-ddff13440656" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="d282d0f5-decc-3cb2-9fd6-28072400d29e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-pavilion-aero-13-laptop-m-series-monitors-130032913.html">focus</a> here is on making a machine that is as thin and light as possible while still offering a decent amount of power and connectivity. Weighing 2.2 pounds, about the same as the 14-inch LG Gram, the Aero is HP’s first low-end machine to pack a taller 16:10 display. It carries a pair of USB-A ports with kick-out covers, HDMI-out and a single USB-C socket alongside a 3.5mm audio jack and the barrel power connector. I’m still torn over the throwback power connector, which on one hand is acceptable and cost-effective, but, again, does your average Gen-Zer not want to minimize the number of chunky charging plugs they’re carrying around?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Build quality is solid, with no flex or creaks when you hold it open with one hand and wave it around. The one place where I’ll take marks off is in the display hinge, which is designed to push the laptop deck up off the table like ASUS’ ZenBook. It just feels a <em>little</em> bit less sturdy than you might expect, which you’ll need to be mindful of if you rest your weight too much on the front of your hands. The malleability of that hinge feels just weak enough to make me paranoid.</p><h2><strong>Keyboard and trackpad</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/10b65770-00ec-11ec-beff-89a1d3d44fef" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="fced83d8-0e8b-3085-8193-65bd57859bb9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>The Pavilion Aero 13’s keyboard is well-engineered and satisfying, with a fair level of travel and a good hit at the end of your press. Interestingly, you need to pony up extra for a model with backlighting, which is either miserly or smart cost-cutting, depending on your perspective. It may not be the same quality as HP’s higher-priced laptops but it’s certainly not a chore to write with.</p><p>Except for, and I am being needlessly grouchy here, HP’s inclusion of a function row along the rightmost side of the keyboard. Most 13-inch laptops, for obvious reasons, try to cut down on superfluous keys that you may only find on more spacious models. And that’s fine, because it’s rare that I ever find myself needing to use Home/Pg Up/Pg Down/End when I have other keyboard shortcuts (and, you know, a trackpad) available.</p><p>I get why HP insists on using them here, but it means that you’ll have a learning curve when coming off pretty much every other laptop in this class. And, if I were king, I would have opted for a standard layout with more breathing room, not to mention full-size up/down keys with more space around them. After more than a week using this thing, I’m still hitting the home key instead of backspace, dramatically slowing my typing speed, much to my frustration.</p><p>As for the trackpad, it’s bigger than on the 2020 model that this replaces, and has a decent click with tolerable accuracy. The lack of a touchscreen on this laptop isn’t, in my opinion, a huge issue given its size and class, so long as the trackpad is solid. And this trackpad is very much that, and there’s not much else to say about it as a consequence.</p><h2><strong>Display, sound and webcam</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/827d14c0-00ec-11ec-afff-ae16491bf2aa" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="33c237ac-9101-31ca-ae9a-fe0659c9b2f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>This machine carries a 13.3-inch HD display, although because of its 16:10 ratio, that 1,920 x 1,200 resolution is actually WUXGA. I don’t think anyone would need a 4K display on a machine like this, but you can configure it with a WQXGA (2,560 x 1,600) screen should you need to. The 400-nit panel can balance any strong summer light, and the matte screen means that you avoid a lot of glare.</p><p>The downward-firing B&amp;O-branded speakers hidden under the edges of the laptop deck provide acceptable audio. They sound a little better than on some ultrabooks I could mention, but it’s still thin and reedy, with tinny equalization presets and nonexistent bass. This is audio you can put up with rather than enjoy during all of those Netflix and Chill sessions where you actually watch Netflix and Chill.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d8539180-00ec-11ec-bee7-4a0ba9972e7b" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="074f82d5-0aa0-3379-9b77-0a6b9403605e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Perhaps I’ve been reviewing too many laptops of late that have some sort of webcam shutter, but the omission here surprises me. The HP WideVision 720p HD camera is at least sharp enough that people can see your face properly when you’re using it. Even better, it handles most light well enough that blow-outs are occasional rather than ever-present, which is good considering how much we all need to Zoom each other right now.</p><h2><strong>Software</strong></h2><h3></h3><p>One thing to note is that HP pre-installs a number of apps onto its laptops, including McAfee, LastPass and ExpressVPN. This means you’ll start getting pop-ups after installing Chrome, telling you that plugins are about to be installed. That I think this is an unacceptable thing to happen, even for a relatively low-cost laptop, should go without saying.</p><h2><strong>Performance and battery life</strong></h2><p></p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>PC Mark 10</p></td><td><p>3D Mark Night Raid</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5 Compute</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>HP Pavilion Aero 13.3 (2021) AMD Ryzen 7 5800U w/ Radeon Integrated, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</p></td><td><p>5,775</p></td><td><p>12,799</p></td><td><p>14,960</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 15&quot; (2021), AMD Ryzen 7 MS w/ Radeon Integrated, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</p></td><td><p>4,620</p></td><td><p>15,517</p></td><td><p>11,909</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 15&quot;, Intel Core i7 1165G7 w/ Intel Xe, 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD</p></td><td><p>4,648</p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>16,659</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Both Intel and AMD have made enormous strides toward integrated graphics units that don’t suck. This is thunderingly relevant in the ultrabook market where thinness and portability are prized over pretty much everything else. After all, even a few years ago you couldn’t have done much more on a machine of this class beyond mash the odd spreadsheet. Now you can expect passable, even quite pleasant performance on a wide variety of tasks, from intensive Chrome browsing to video games.</p><p>The model that HP sent to reviewers retails for $999, and includes AMD’s Ryzen 5800U with Radeon Integrated Graphics, which packs 512MB of dedicated DDR4 VRAM. Rounding out the spec list is 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, which sits on the higher end of what you can expect to get for this sort of money. Certainly, the benchmarks make this thing look a lot less powerful, but I suspect the Aero simply isn’t set up for intensive gaming. It’s worth saying that even the fan noise isn’t that aggressive under heavy load, too.</p><p>That said, I was able to play<em> Fortnite</em> pretty smoothly on this machine with the graphics set to Medium, and an evening’s marathon session of<em> Two Point Hospital </em>passed without comment. Certainly, if you are happy with undemanding titles, you’ll be able to squeeze a lot of fun from this machine.<em> GTA V’s</em> benchmarking tool was able to produce a fairly consistent 30fps, and if you dial down all of the visuals, you can get this running fast enough to play <em>in a pinch</em>.</p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>Battery Life</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>HP Pavilion Aero 13.3 (2021)</p></td><td><p>9:43</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Nano</p></td><td><p>9:14</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360</p></td><td><p>15:20</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Battery life is similarly resilient, with this machine clocking in at 9 hours and 43 minutes in our standard rundown test. When untethered from power, I didn’t feel any nagging urgency to head back to a socket while using this thing, and you should expect this to last for the length of your working day. And, to be honest, if this had conked out any sooner I would be screaming from the rooftops about it, since the whole point of an ultraportable is, after all, to be portable.</p><h2><strong>Price and the competition</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2c4e4960-00ed-11ec-afde-20964270a7e3" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="9f497013-2c16-3def-a02a-18cb86e08b74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>As I said, the model I’m <a href="https://www.hp.com/us-en/laptops/pavilion/pavilion-aero-13-laptop.html">testing costs $999</a>. That’s a fair price, especially if you try to configure a similar spec list with some rival machines in the same category. There are some alternatives, and if your priority is a slender, lightweight machine, then <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:LG&#x002019;s Gram 14" href="https://bit.ly/2WuSLrd">LG’s Gram 14</a> can be picked up for $799.99. It has a 14-inch WUXGA display and weighs 2.2 pounds. Sadly, its specs fall far short of HP’s offering, with an Intel Core i3-1115G4, 8GB RAM and a 256GB SSD. You could also opt for <a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202103AM260000011/A18489-ASUS-ZenBook-13-OLED-Ultra-Slim-Laptop%2C-13.3%E2%80%9D-OLED-FHD-NanoEdge-Bezel-Display%2C-AMD-Ryzen-7-5700U%2C-8GB-LPDDR4X-RAM%2C-512GB-PCIe-SSD%2C-NumberPad%2C-Wi-Fi-5%2C-Windows-10-Home%2C-Pine-Grey%2C-UM325UA-DS71">ASUS’ ZenBook 13 OLED</a>, which packs a Ryzen 7 5700U, 8GB RAM, a 512GB SSD and an OLED display for $899.99.</p><p>If you’re feeling picky, you could do worse than to wait for more AMD-toting laptops to enter retail channels in the near future. I expect that we’ll see models similar to Lenovo’s ThinkPad X13 and Acer’s Spin 3 with comparable internals coming very soon. At which point, you should have your pick of any number of high-quality machines that can do jobs similar to this one.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3cb2c240-00ed-11ec-bf9d-65596459b146" alt="HP Pavilion 13 Aero Review" data-uuid="5dc46138-2498-33cd-98c2-9449467928b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>This isn’t a fair comparison at all, but in my head I keep thinking about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html">Dell’s XPS 13</a> which, for many people, is either the gold-standard ultrabook, or in the top three. And, right now, that on both specs and price, the Pavilion Aero 13 is a more compelling choice. When you look at the base model XPS 13, which starts $1,019.99, the only thing that HP loses out on is aesthetics. In almost every other regard, I’d much rather have this Pavilion Aero than the XPS and that, to me, is<em> wild</em>.</p><p>I think the Pavilion Aero 13 is a very good machine, with a solid thin-and-light body and performance that punches well above its weight. For some people, the 5800U running the show is enough of a reason to buy one of these that everything else is broadly immaterial. Do I wish it was priced a little more aggressively? Yes, because I could forgive the learning curve with the keyboard if it was a hundred bucks cheaper. Despite the keyboard and sound, though, it’s a good machine for folks who want a little bit of everything.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hp-pavilion-aero-13-review-powerful-and-cheap-143034549.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a5e7e68-e438-40c8-b1f3-0386641f8c55</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 14:30:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630002800</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T18:33:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/febd5040-069b-11ec-acb7-015e810404d9" width="1852" height="1191" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/febd5040-069b-11ec-acb7-015e810404d9" width="1852" height="1191" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HP Pavilion Aero]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HP Pavilion Aero]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon Prime Gaming's free titles for September include 'Knockout City']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is adding more titles to the list Prime Gaming subscribers can claim for free starting on September 1st.

Now you can pick up a Watch SE for even less at Amazon while a couple of models are on sale.

The Watch SE <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-review-watchos-7-price-specs-comparison-172542713.html">performed well</a> in our testing, despite running on an older processor than the one found in the Series 6, and it has all of the core features of watchOS 7 including heart rate monitoring with high and low alerts, noise monitoring, fall detection, Emergency SOS and more.

And with these models on sale, you&#39;re getting cellular connectivity — that means you can make and receive calls, send text messages and more even when your iPhone isn&#39;t around. The Apple Watch is still very much an iPhone accessory, but those with LTE will get the most untethered experience.</p><p>Even though you have to give up a few features with the Apple Watch SE, you&#39;re still getting one of the best smartwatches available today. But we&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention that Apple may be coming out with new models soon. We typically see new Apple Watches announced along with the latest iPhones in September, but there&#39;s no guarantee a new Watch SE will make the lineup this year.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-44mm-cellular-deal-59-off-amazon-131506828.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a7ad755-5832-46db-8603-eedec39d71a0</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 13:15:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629983063</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T13:04:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/dc958f30-4145-11eb-878f-40f17f10cb63" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/dc958f30-4145-11eb-878f-40f17f10cb63" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The Apple Watch SE (44mm with cellular) is down to $300 at Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Rock's new Under Armour over-ear headphones pack ANC and a 45-hour battery life]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fans of celeb-endorsed gadgets rejoice.

A new report claims a glitch in its secretive software program used by the FBI allowed unauthorized personnel to access private data for more than a year. According to <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/08/25/fbi-palantir-glitch-allowed-unauthorized-access-to-private-data/"><em>The New York Post</em></a>, the mishap was revealed in a letter by prosecutors in the Manhattan federal court case against accused hacker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-01-crypto-expert-arrested-over-north-korea-sanctions.html">Virgil Griffith</a>. Palantir denied the claims in a statement and said the fault was caused by the FBI&#39;s incorrect use of the software.</p><p>Griffith was arrested in 2019 for allegedly providing North Korea with information on how cryptocurrency and blockchain tech could help it to evade US sanctions. The incident in question revolves around the alleged hacker&#39;s social media data, obtained through a federal search warrant in March 2020. According to the letter, the Twitter and Facebook information was uploaded to Palantir&#39;s program through the default settings, effectively allowing unauthorized FBI employees to access it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Between May 2020 to August 2021, the material was accessed four times by three analysts and an agent. The FBI case agent assigned to Griffith&#39;s case was alerted to the issue by a colleague earlier this month, according to the letter. Those who accessed the info reportedly told prosecutors that they did not recall using it in their investigations.</p><p>“An FBI analyst, in the course of conducting a separate investigation, had identified communications between the defendant and the subject of that other investigation by means of searches on the Platform that accessed the Search Warrant Returns,” the letter noted.</p><p>Palantir is trying to distance itself from the issue. &quot;There was no glitch in the software,&quot; it told <em>The New York Post</em> in a statement, adding that the &quot;customer&quot; did not follow the &quot;rigorous protocols established to protect search warrant returns.&quot;</p><p>Amid increasing growth, the last thing Palantir needs is a major PR crisis involving flaws in its software.

That certainly sounds like great news for users who&#39;ve been waiting for it after Google retired Play Music for Wear OS in 2020. The bad news is, as noted by <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/25/youtube-music-for-wear-os-hands-on/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>, it only currently works on Google&#39;s Wear OS 3 platform.

But aside from that clever bit of wordplay, the title also carries a deeper meaning: That as much as we’d like to forget about the more embarrassing moments of the Star Trek franchise, they still happened and they weren’t all bad. Even, and especially, <em>Voyager</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/330ae480-05c9-11ec-acaa-bbf159c1d5d2" data-uuid="9b3711ed-3f9d-36ca-84e8-8916185ae74e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>Viewer reactions to <em>Voyager</em> have been rather polarized over the course of the 26 years since it premiered. Back in the ‘90s, many fans were excited to have a “real” Star Trek show again, one that took place on a ship that was constantly exploring, unlike the comparatively stationary political drama of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. But clunky writing soured many people’s opinion on <em>Voyager</em>, and toward the end of its run the show was known more for Seven of Nine’s skintight outfits and its slate of guest stars of the week, including Jason Alexander and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.</p><p>After the show went off the air, the franchise stopped moving forward in its timeline, choosing to explore Starfleet’s founding in <em>Enterprise</em> and rebooting the entire universe completely with the 2009 Star Trek movie. While fans were thrown a bone with a brief cameo by Admiral Kathryn Janeway in the last <em>TNG</em>-era film, <em>Nemesis</em>, <em>Voyager</em> would essentially disappear from the Star Trek canon until the appearance of Seven of Nine in episode four of <em>Picard</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/85ead300-05c8-11ec-a73f-27b38dd4d507" data-uuid="e259426f-b4ab-3d61-9c56-1b9e35d74ee3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Trae Patton</div></figure><p>For fans of <em>The Next Generation</em>, <em>Picard</em> had its upsides: We got to see Troi and Riker as a family, and Data got a better sendoff into the afterlife. But for fans of <em>Voyager</em>, it was anything but positive, with the death of a supporting character and a rather grim existence for fan-favorite Seven of Nine.</p><p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> rolls back the clock a little bit, as it takes place a year after the events of <em>Nemesis</em>, making it our first real view of the Star Trek universe’s immediate future after <em>TNG</em>, <em>DS9</em> and <em>Voyager</em>. The Dominion War is over, Romulus is under a new regime and the crew of the <em>USS Voyager</em> are basically celebrities after seven years spent in the Delta Quadrant; <em>Picard</em> takes place nearly twenty years later, when the luster would have been gone.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c6289830-05c8-11ec-ab6b-c3638ea0c8f3" data-uuid="660c1f35-3f18-3955-93ae-e716739fe980"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Matt Kennedy</div></figure><p>Here everything is just shiny and new and worthy of commemorative plates — a bit of a weird thing to exist in a post-scarcity culture, but this is a comedy series, after all. And in this week’s B-plot, Brad Boimler is looking to get one of his plates signed by a special guest to the <em>USS Cerritos</em>: Tom Paris. Or, as Brad refers to the former Voyager crew member, “Creator of Fairhaven, Captain Proton himself” as well as the first human to break the transwarp barrier. Straight off, that’s a reference to three of the goofiest, oddball and some say worst episodes of <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em>. And just in case you forgot what was so bad about the last one, Mariner asks “is he still a salamander?,” because that is <em>a thing that happened </em>in the episode “Threshold.”</p><div id="0720ea20bac04daca218217ca6373404"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DBk2ejb6i8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Undeterred (and perhaps even encouraged) by the weirdness, Boimler is all hyped to meet his hero. Even after the ship’s system doesn’t recognize him and won’t let him through any doors, he takes to the Jefferies tubes to make his way to the bridge to meet Lt. Paris.</p><p>In a way, it feels like a metaphor for how the fandom feels about <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> now. While everyone admits it had a lot of dumb moments, those actually made it more<em>&nbsp;</em>endearing. The famous line “<a href="https://youtu.be/mhyaBVmzWT8">there’s coffee in that nebula</a>” would inspire astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti to bring a replica uniform with her and wear it on a mission back in 2015:</p><div id="40d329226767429683df50cb1d7442ef"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;There&#39;s coffee in that nebula&quot;... ehm, I mean... in that <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dragon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Dragon</a>. <a href="http://t.co/9MYrqIOXnI">pic.twitter.com/9MYrqIOXnI</a></p>— Samantha Cristoforetti (@AstroSamantha) <a href="https://twitter.com/AstroSamantha/status/589035429879513088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 17, 2015</a></blockquote></div><p>And who can forget the infamous “Tuvix” episode, where crew members Tuvok and Neelix were merged into one being thanks to a transporter accident? Though the resulting individual was healthy and happy, the decision was made to <a href="https://youtu.be/y2qGO3dOPOU">force him</a> to split back into his component persons, inspiring the recent internet rallying cry “Janeway murdered Tuvix.” Even Janeway actor Kate Mulgrew entered the debate, responding to a tweet from Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. When you’ve got politicians involved it’s not really a fandom in-joke anymore.</p><div id="b6617b80c86c40738c350e57e58b5f57"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Willing to hear the crew’s thoughts, as always.

It’s not as good as <em>TNG</em> or <em>DS9</em>, but it still has its fair share of fans. I remember a time when it seemed like it was constantly  running on Spike TV (now the Paramount Network), as opposed to <em>Deep Space Nine</em>, which is seldom rerun due to its serialized nature. Last year I sat down and rewatched the entire Star Trek franchise, including <em>Voyager</em>, and saw quite a few episodes I had missed the first time. I found myself enjoying some of it, cringing just as often, and eventually remembering why I had stopped watching the show for a while back when it aired. In general, I feel like the show’s biggest problem was missed potential, like the way the conflict between the Starfleet and Maquis crew members was quickly smoothed over, how it underutilized many of its cast, and why on earth did Harry Kim never get promoted.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/aa800f00-05c8-11ec-8bdf-b8129d686be5" data-uuid="05acc3a9-4e63-30d4-b2e4-1bc23f7e6467"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>However, it’s not the job of <em>Lower Decks</em> to explain or redeem <em>Voyager</em>. Boimler and Tom Paris are only the B-plot here, with the main drive of the episode being Tendi and Mariner’s mission to pick up a package for Doctor T’Ana as well as Rutherford’s quest to find out how a certain dead officer is alive again. The episode just asks us to consider what it would be like to be a Starfleet officer and hear about all of <em>Voyager</em>’s adventures in the Delta Quadrant. Weird and goofy? Yes. But honestly, they’re also pretty cool.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-tom-paris-voyager-070055176.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7266a3c5-5c0c-4aae-a524-c1e29b2f43f6</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 07:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629914412</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T18:00:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5b547b0-05c7-11ec-bf8f-deb9637f2186" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5b547b0-05c7-11ec-bf8f-deb9637f2186" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["We'll Always Have Tom Parisâ -- Robert Duncan McNeill as Tom Paris of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

In a survey involving 24 federal agencies on their use of facial recognition technology, the Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services, Interior, Justice, State, Treasury and Veterans Affairs departments told GAO that they&#39;re planning to use facial recognition in more areas through fiscal year 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/25/federal-facial-recognition-expansion/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> notes, most agencies already use facial recognition to give their personnel access to their phones and computers. However, there&#39;s a growing number of agencies using it to investigate crime and to track people. The Department of Agriculture apparently wants to monitor the live feeds at its facilities and scan for individuals in the watch list. Another agency wants to use it to automate identity verification for travelers at airports.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The agencies are planning this expansion despite the strengthening pushback against facial recognition systems. They&#39;re still far from being perfectly accurate, especially when identifying women and POCs, and have led to false arrests in the past. In Detroit, their use led to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facial-recognition-false-match-wrongful-arrest-224053761.html">wrongful arrest</a> of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facial-recognition-wrongful-arrest-michigan-141531393.html">two men</a> last year, both of whom are Black.

At the same time, several cities across the US, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/portland-facial-recognition-ban-035952590.html">Portland, Oregon</a>, had also restricted their use. GAO&#39;s report noted, however, that &quot;recent advancements in facial recognition technology have increased its accuracy and its usage.&quot;</p><p>Ten of GAO&#39;s respondents have also revealed they&#39;ve been involved in the research and development of facial recognition tech. For instance, they&#39;re looking into the technology&#39;s ability to identify individuals wearing masks and to detect image manipulation. In addition, several agencies, including the Justice Department, the Air Force and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, admitted to using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-clearview-ai-police-surveillance-explained.html">Clearview AI</a>.

As of last year, the system, which can identify people in real time, was reportedly in use by 600 police departments across the US, including the FBI and DHS.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ten-federal-agencies-expanding-facial-recognition-070044629.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">18ed097f-1c22-4cce-845c-29c80470f405</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 07:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629961260</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T07:01:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d6385430-0632-11ec-9d54-a4ebe312b944" width="5988" height="3992" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d6385430-0632-11ec-9d54-a4ebe312b944" width="5988" height="3992" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AndreyPopov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Selective Focus Of People Faces Recognized With Intellectual Learning System]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[People Faces Recognized With Intellectual Learning System]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A year later, we now know more about Facebook's Project Aria AR glasses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To say that Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebooks-first-ar-glasses-will-be-here-next-year-180101648.html">Project Aria AR glasses</a> were never meant for consumers would be an understatement. Facebook does not even consider them a prototype. And they are not, and may never be, available for purchase. Rather, Facebook has always described them as a way for its employees to study and test augmented reality tech.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/announcing-project-aria-a-research-project-on-the-future-of-wearable-ar/">announcement at the time</a> made clear the company&#39;s intentions, it was light on details about how the glasses would actually work. Now, nearly a year after the initial launch, a series of regulatory documents are giving us a belated first peek inside. In a <a href="https://fccid.io/2AWS6-5646/User-Manual/Users-Manual-5086339.pdf">user manual</a> first reported by <a href="https://www.protocol.com/project-aria-gemini-ar-glasses"><em>Protocol</em></a>, we learn that this specific device goes by the codename Gemini EVT, with EVT being an abbreviation for &quot;engineering valuation test.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you might expect, given the stated purpose of the device, there is no visual AR component. Meaning, there&#39;s no built-in display for viewing 3D image overlays. Again, the glasses in their early form really do exist just for this small team of engineers to collect data.</p><p>Not that you can buy one but if you could, the glasses would also support prescription lenses, the manual reveals.</p><p>Additionally, the manual indicates there&#39;s a proximity sensor on the inner temple, along with four cameras that can capture both video and still photos. Interestingly, Facebook used the same camera sensors here that it did on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Oculus Quest 2 headset</a>, our review of which we published the same day in September last year that Facebook announced Project Aria. Given the timing, it may just be those sensors were the most readily available to Facebook.</p><p>Also inside is a Qualcomm chipset, with a modified version of Android powering the software experience. Charging happens via a USB cable, which attached magnetically to the glasses.</p><p>The user experience seems simple, as far as we can tell. There are shutter and power buttons, plus a mute switch that &quot;toggles privacy mode on/off.&quot; When a recording is in progress, a series of LEDs help passerby understand that the camera is on. Meanwhile, there&#39;s a companion iOS app called Ariane that handles the basics: device setup, scanning for WiFi networks, showing the battery status and uploading what data the sensors have collected. It&#39;s unclear, however, if there is also an Android version of the app that exists, or is in the works. Again, not that you&#39;d be able to download it either way.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-project-aria-ar-glasses-details-030106045.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6f45a3b4-19b9-45a2-8baa-7dd8f762b306</guid><dc:creator>Dana Wollman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 03:01:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629981489</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T12:38:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Dana Wollman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3a207b30-066a-11ec-bf5f-0c8d42b77df7" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3a207b30-066a-11ec-bf5f-0c8d42b77df7" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A promo image for the Facebook Project Aria smartglasses, showing a man wearing them outside from his right profile and holding a smartphone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Project Aria]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft is killing its Office app on Chromebooks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;re not sure who or how many people use Microsoft Office on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Chromebook</a> but if that&#39;s you, you&#39;re in for a downgraded experience. Microsoft will soon kill its Office app for Android on Chrome OS, the company <a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/microsoft-ending-chromebook-support-for-office-android-apps-in-september/">confirmed Wednesday to <em>About Chromebooks</em></a>. The app will leave the Google Play Store on September 18th, at which point users will need to sign in through the web via Office.com or Outlook.com. As <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/25/microsoft-office-chromebook-android-app/"><em>9to5Google notes</em></a>, the Office app will still be available on Android phones, even as it vanishes from Chrome OS.</p><p>Though signing in via the web app should work in a pinch, it&#39;s clearly an inferior experience to what the Android app has offered until now, not to mention what Google&#39;s G Suite can do on its native Google-controlled platform. In particular, be warned that the web app offers almost no offline access, something users have enjoyed on the Google Play Store version.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s unclear why Microsoft is making this change, except that the company described the move in a statement to <em>About Chromebooks</em> as an &quot;effort to provide the most optimized experience for Chrome OS/Chromebook customers.&quot; In a statement, a Google spokesperson said: &quot;We&#39;re pleased to see Microsoft offer Chrome OS users a more optimized experience and embrace the open web. People love Chrome OS because it provides a speedy, secure, and simple computing experience and helps them stay connected while they work, study and stay entertained.&quot;</p><p>Whatever Microsoft&#39;s intention, this is likely to give Chromebook users another reason to give the G Suite a try, if they haven&#39;t already. Or hey, perhaps they&#39;ll ditch their Chromebooks and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-154014628.html">download the Android app on Windows 11</a>.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-ending-office-app-support-chromebooks-september-2021-015505503.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9bba539c-44f4-46cf-86d5-e97b0960b87e</guid><dc:creator>Dana Wollman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 01:55:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629998337</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T17:19:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Dana Wollman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2b60da50-060a-11ec-bfeb-9d18e78a913a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2b60da50-060a-11ec-bfeb-9d18e78a913a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 in red.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
