That&#39;s it, that&#39;s all you need to know. I&#39;ve seen dozens of OLED screens over the last decade, and they never fail to impress. By their very nature they look bolder and capture inky blacks better than most LCD screens. So take that together with the latest hardware from Intel and NVIDIA, and you&#39;ve got a surefire ultraportable powerhouse.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="6a145e1d-6327-4b26-ba92-6b557ed5524c"/><p>Now, if you remember last year&#39;s redesigned XPS 15 you&#39;ll probably have a hard time telling this new model apart. It still has a sturdy and thin aluminum unibody case, but the star of the show is the 15.6-inch display. It has some of the thinnest bezels on the market, which almost makes the screen seem as if it&#39;s floating in the air. New this year is the 3.5K OLED touchscreen model, but you can also choose from two LCD panels: a 4K+ touchscreen and a 1080p+ display. The plus on those resolutions just means they pack a few more vertical pixels to reach a 16 x 10 aspect ratio.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While I&#39;m clearly partial to what OLED adds to the experience, all of the displays should look great. They each support Dolby Vision HDR, and the LCD models are also fairly bright at 500 nits. The OLED version maxes out at 400 nits, but the vastly better contrast should make up for it. It&#39;s also the only screen that supports 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut, making it ideal for artists who demand color accuracy.</p><p>I&#39;ll admit: I&#39;m mainly reviewing the XPS 15 to gawk at its screen. As soon as I powered it up, I put on the <em>Matrix Resurrections</em> trailer in 4K HDR just to see if it looked better than my OLED TV. Of course the TV looked better, but I was still impressed by the XPS 15. The glimpses we see at night look truly black, bright elements like explosions and sunlight were so brilliant they made me tear up a bit, and it managed to juggle scenes that had <em>both</em> bright and dark aspects. That&#39;s the advantage of OLED.</p><section data-eng-breakout="7dacc08d02124613867835f46506e967" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6fda7533-1c97-11ec-bb37-e3dcfd4bbaa9" alt="Dell XPS 15 OLED"></section><p>To push the XPS 15&#39;s display to the max, I turned to Ang Lee&#39;s <em>Gemini Man</em>, one of the few films viewable in 4K with HDR at 60 frames per second. Say what you will about the movie, but the OLED screen made the shootout between Will Smith and his younger clone feel almost as thrilling as watching it in theaters. Sure, it doesn&#39;t have a full 4K resolution, but that&#39;s not something you&#39;ll really notice while watching it. Another bonus: Dell&#39;s upward-firing speakers did a decent job throughout most of the action.</p><p>Outside of video, the XPS 15&#39;s OLED screen made looking at just about everything a joy. I&#39;ve never had so much fun scrolling through text-heavy websites — even jotting ideas down in Evernote felt a bit more satisfying, thanks to the ultra crisp text. Photos just about popped off the screen, as you&#39;d expect. The DCI-P3 color range is around 25 percent wider than the more common sRGB, which means images will be able to show off more depth.</p><p>The only way the XPS 15&#39;s screen could look better was if it took a cue from gaming laptops and offered a faster refresh rate. Going above 60Hz makes scrolling images and text look instantly smoother, but it&#39;ll likely be a few years before work-focused notebooks take advantage of that tech.<br></p><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark Night Raid</p></td><td><p>ATTO disk speeds (top read/write)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dell XPS 15 (Intel i7-11800H, NVIDIA RTX 3050 Ti 45w)</p></td><td><p>5,966</p></td><td><p>22,264</p></td><td><p>2.8 GB/s / 2.6 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Dell XPS 15 (Intel i7-10875H, NVIDIA GTX 1650 Ti)</p></td><td><p>3,962</p></td><td><p>18,500</p></td><td><p>3 GB/s / 2.4 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Surface Laptop 4 15&quot; (AMD Ryzen 7 4980U Surface Edition, Radeon)</p></td><td><p>4,620</p></td><td><p>15,517</p></td><td><p>1.9 GB/s / 985 MB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS ZenBook Duo (Intel Core i7-1165G7, Xe graphics)</p></td><td><p>4,704</p></td><td><p>15,315</p></td><td><p>3.3 GB/s / 2.48 GB/s</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>Our XPS 15 review unit was powered by an eight-core Intel i7-11800H, 16GB of RAM and a 45-watt version of NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 3050 Ti GPU. That&#39;s on the low-end of that GPU&#39;s potential power usage — it can go all the way up to 80 watts — which means it&#39;s far less capable than the same card in a gaming notebook. Still, it should be a huge upgrade from last year&#39;s GTX 1650 Ti. In the GPU-focused Geekbench 5 Compute benchmark, for example, the XPS 15 notched around 6,000 more points than last year&#39;s model.</p><p>I can&#39;t imagine too many people will be judging the XPS 15 on its gaming capabilities, not when you can get faster screens and potentially better hardware for similar prices from dedicated laptops. But if you&#39;re just itching to get a bit of <em>Overwatch</em> action in once in a while, it&#39;s good enough to reach 70fps in Overwatch at 2,560 by 1,600 (1,440p+) at the highest graphics settings. Honestly, it has enough power to tackle most modern games. Just don&#39;t try playing them at 3.5K.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6fdbfbd1-1c97-11ec-8f77-5de58b0380df" alt="Dell XPS 15 OLED" data-uuid="831c69dd-3e18-313e-8729-8e70fb31134b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The XPS 15 also scored around 50 percent higher in the PCMark 10 benchmark, something I&#39;d attribute both to that Intel CPU and the NVIDIA hardware. You can expect it to tackle most intense workloads with ease. It managed to transcode a one-minute 4K video file into 1080p in 35 seconds using Handbrake and the NVIDIA encoder.</p><p>As for the XPS 15&#39;s keyboard and trackpad, they&#39;re unchanged from last year. I appreciated the keyboard&#39;s wide layout and responsive keys, though I hope Dell explores ways to add even more depth. It&#39;d be nice for some of that CherryMX technology from Alienware&#39;s gaming laptops to make its way to the XPS line. The trackpad, meanwhile, is luxuriously smooth. No complaints there.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6fdb86a0-1c97-11ec-9ffd-2c4315902940" alt="Dell XPS 15 OLED" data-uuid="cde0b525-a1cb-3840-9df1-fe1e39854e8c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I&#39;d like to see more than three USB-C ports, but at least two of them support Thunderbolt 4. And I&#39;ll always give a laptop extra credit for including a full-sized SD card slot. That&#39;s something photographers everywhere will appreciate. I was also surprised to find that the OLED screen didn&#39;t ding the XPS’s battery life as much as I thought it would. It lasted for nine hours and 55 minutes in our battery benchmark, compared to 10 hours and 10 minutes on last year&#39;s model with a 4K+ LCD.</p><p>The only downside of the XPS 15 is that Dell was a bit slow to add OLED. Remember, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-08-dell-4k-oled-xps-alienware.html">said OLED would be coming to the XPS 15 </a>since CES 2019. I was surprised that Dell didn&#39;t include it in the XPS 15&#39;s redesign last year and I wager the pandemic slowed things down a bit. But other PC makers, like ASUS, were much quicker to build OLED laptops, so it’s hard to make excuses for Dell.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6fdac350-1c97-11ec-bf9f-34ba25a76d38" alt="Dell XPS 15 OLED" data-uuid="87db685e-91cf-3999-9381-48e7daef1489"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>The new XPS 15 starts at $1,300 with a Core i5 processor, integrated graphics, 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. You&#39;d have to shell out $2,000 to nab our review unit with a 512GB SSD. Those are reasonable prices for 15-inch workhorse machines, especially when the 16-inch MacBook Pro is a rather painful $2,400 and still has an aging ninth-gen Intel chip.</p><p>Honestly, I didn&#39;t expect Dell to do much with the XPS 15 after last year. But the addition of OLED goes a long way. It&#39;s one of the best screens you can find on a laptop today. It&#39;s so good, in fact, that it makes the XPS 15 almost perfect.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-15-oled-review-practically-perfect-15-inch-screen-laptop-120033751.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4636272a-a0fc-475f-8998-d49045869192</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 12:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632428208</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T20:16:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/902623d0-1c9b-11ec-97d9-f74ded444f0c" width="2000" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/902623d0-1c9b-11ec-97d9-f74ded444f0c" width="2000" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dell XPS 15 OLED]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dell XPS 15 OLED]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox gains new features with updated Edge browser]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With its September <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/09/23/september-2021-xbox-update/">Xbox update</a>, Microsoft has brought the new, Chromium-based Edge browser to Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One consoles.

The bloc has, like clockwork, tabled a proposal for legislators to think about maybe possibly having a debate about if it’s worth <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-proposes-usb-c-as-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices-131605815.html"><ins>creating a common charging standard</ins></a>.</p><p>This has happened more than a few times before, as it pushed micro-USB as a voluntary standard in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-06-29-nokia-apple-rim-and-others-agree-on-micro-usb-phone-charger-st.html"><ins>2009</ins></a> and tried to pass it into law in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-14-europe-votes-for-common-charger-law.html"><ins>2014</ins></a>. And in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-07-eu-study-harmonize-phone-chargers.html"><ins>2018</ins></a>. And it started this process again in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-european-union-wants-common-charging-cable-standard.html"><ins>January 2020</ins></a>, although some world-shattering event got in the way of that process.</p><p>The new proposal would require that “all smartphones, tablets, cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld video game consoles” would use USB-C for charging. The law would also “unbundle” the sale of chargers from devices as a way of reducing e-waste.</p><p>EU officials are also proposing for technology manufacturers to harmonize their fast charging technology to ensure continuity between devices. Officials added that such harmonization would prevent “different producers unjustifiably [limiting] the charging speed” which isn&#39;t really the issue here.</p><p>Naturally, the obvious target for this is Apple, which has already come out against the proposal. Perhaps it will be this, rather than anything else, that prompts the arrival of the long-rumored <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-05-apple-2021-iphone-with-no-lightning-port.html"><ins>portless iPhone</ins></a>.</p><p>This proposal may, like its predecessors, wind up dashed against the rocks of politics never to be heard from again.

Warner Bros. Unscripted Television is producing the documentary, which will detail the influence and legacy of DC from the time it was established and the time Superman was born in the 1930s. The division is working with Leslie Iwerks (as co-director and executive producer) and Greg Berlanti (as executive producer) for the project.&nbsp;</p><p>Iwerks is known for several other high-profile documentaries, including <em>The Pixar Story </em>that showed audiences what happens behind the scenes at the animation studio and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-disney-plus-launch-musicals-documentaries-jeff-goldblum.html"><em>The Imagineering Story</em></a>, which gives viewers a look at how Disney develops rides and attractions for its parks. She will co-direct the documentary with Mark Catalena, who served as editor for <em>The Imagineering Story</em>. Meanwhile, Berlanti is a prolific writer, director and producer who&#39;d previously worked on <em>Doom Patrol, Supergirl, DC&#39;s Legends of Tomorrow, Superman and Lois, The Flash</em> and <em>Black Lightning</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Jim Lee, DC&#39;s Publisher and Chief Creative Officer, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;DC has a rich legacy of over 80 years of iconic storytelling: from the introduction of the genre defining Super Hero Superman in 1938 to the amazing movies, TV shows, cartoons, games and comics which have been synonymous with superheroism for generations thereafter. We are so excited to dive into this history and bring fans along this amazing journey.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The docu series doesn&#39;t have a release date yet, but it will expand HBO Max&#39;s DC offerings further when it arrives. WarnerMedia started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dc-streaming-hbo-max-061247904.html">migrating</a> all DC Universe content to HBO Max last year, making the former streaming platform a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dc-universe-infinite-comics-only-service-160443281.html">comics-only</a> subscription service.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/warner-documentary-dc-comics-hbo-max-105400422.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f2b62bd8-c94f-44d1-ba7f-e0b4fe626470</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 10:54:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632480865</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T10:54:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Visual Arts]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Humanities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/83739550-1d1d-11ec-95f7-a1d78279c3db" width="4500" height="3000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/83739550-1d1d-11ec-95f7-a1d78279c3db" width="4500" height="3000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[exhibition 'Universo DC Comics' (lit.

It may have a significantly longer flight time along with not just one, but two cameras, including a telephoto model and one with a larger Four Thirds sensor.

It reportedly comes with two separate cameras, including a 20-megapixel, 24mm f/2.8-f/11 primary camera with a Four Thirds sensor, along with a 12-megapixel, 1/2-inch sensor secondary camera with a 160mm-equivalent telephoto lens.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e0eb724add9d49a89bd0fe3b585e97d2"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Mavic3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Mavic3</a> full manual and specs!

Currently, shooting in that format requires a large, relatively expensive drone and in many cases, a separate camera like DJI&#39;s <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1186060-REG/dji_x5l_camera_and_3_axis.html">Zenmuse</a> line or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-mirrorless-camera-lumix-bgh1-163525921.html">Panasonic&#39;s BGH1</a>. At the same time, a second telephoto camera would make it more versatile.</p><p>It will also offer direct USB-C charging so you don&#39;t need to remove the battery. All of that will boost the weight a bit, up from 907g on the Mavic 2 Pro to 920g for the Mavic 3 Pro. Despite that bump from the extra camera and other new features, the Mavic 3 will be able to fly for 46 minutes, way up from the 31 minutes available on the Mavic 2.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mavic 3 will apparently come in two flavors, a Pro and a Cine model, with the latter offering a built-in SSD and a &quot;1Gbps Lightspeed Data Cable&quot; option for faster transfers. It will also offer a new version of DJI&#39;s display-equipped Smart Controller allowing for video transmission over 15km, up from 10km on the Mavic 2 Pro.&nbsp;</p><p>The Mavic 3 Pro will cost $1,600, both sources say, which is the same price as the current Mavic 2 Pro. Prices for the Cine model are less clear, but could run around $1,000 more — still a relative deal for such a high tech camera drone. Both are expected to arrive on November 15th.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dji-mavic-3-drone-may-have-a-bigger-sensor-and-46-minute-flight-time-090542963.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9e5297f-ae7f-48a1-903f-ff2d4c622803</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Sep 2021 09:05:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632472702</ingested><modified>2021-09-24T08:38:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91810b60-1d08-11ec-bfda-e10652868cbb" width="4032" height="2739" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/91810b60-1d08-11ec-bfda-e10652868cbb" width="4032" height="2739" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alwyn Scott / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of Chinese drone maker DJI is seen at the company's office in New York, New York, U.S., August 11, 2017.

Another part of the legislation mandates platforms include a clause in their contracts with restaurants to ensure they provide bathroom access to delivery workers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both Grubhub and DoorDash told Engadget they support the legislation, though the latter voiced some reservations about specific measures. “We recognize the unique challenges facing delivery workers in New York City and share the goal of identifying policies that will help Dashers and workers like them,” a DoorDash spokesperson said. “We will continue to work with all stakeholders, including the City Council, to identify ways to support all delivery workers in New York City without unintended consequences.”</p><p>The company specifically pointed to the restroom mandate, which lawmakers tweaked near the end of the process to put the onus of ensuring compliance on platform holders. It’s also concerned about a provision that gives delivery workers the ability to set limits on their routes. The company contends that’s something that could hurt customers in underserved areas.</p><p>Meanwhile, Grubhub voiced, at least publicly, stronger support for the laws. “These bills are common-sense steps to support the delivery workers who work hard every day for New York’s restaurants and residents,” a spokesperson for the company told Engadget. “Ensuring they receive a living wage and have access to restrooms isn’t just a good idea — it’s the right thing to do.”</p><p>Just how difficult it can be to make a living as a delivery worker was put in sharp relief last month when Hurricane Ida blanketed New York City with torrential rain. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/nyregion/ida-delivery-workers-safety.html"><ins>Images and videos</ins></a> of workers navigating flooded streets spread on social media, leading to calls for more regulation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/new-york-city-food-delivery-workers-laws-234217000.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c4438151-4218-41eb-9bed-50ceec2690f2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 23:42:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632440543</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T23:42:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/be8aa510-25f3-11eb-b6ff-e33a90341a89" width="4977" height="3319" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/be8aa510-25f3-11eb-b6ff-e33a90341a89" width="4977" height="3319" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carlo Allegri / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A delivery person for Doordash rides his bike in the rain during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., November 13, 2020.

Per the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58668534"><em><ins>BBC</ins></em></a>, the UK Court of Appeal recently <a href="https://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2021/1374.html"><ins>ruled</ins></a> against Dr. Stephen Thaler in a case involving the country’s Intellectual Property Office. In 2018, Thaler filed two patent applications in which he didn’t list himself as the creator of the inventions mentioned in the documents. Instead, he put down his AI DABUS and said the patent should go to him “by ownership of the creativity machine.”</p><p>The Intellectual Property Office told Thaler he had to list a real person on the application. When he didn’t do that, the agency decided he had withdrawn from the process. Thaler took the case to the UK’s High Court. The body ruled against him, leading to the eventual appeal. &quot;Only a person can have rights. A machine cannot,&quot; Lady Justice Elisabeth Laing of the Appeal Court wrote in her judgment. &quot;A patent is a statutory right and it can only be granted to a person.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Thaler has filed similar legal challenges in other countries, and the results so far have been mixed. In August, a <a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/australian-judge-rules-inventions-6431529/"><ins>judge in Australia ruled</ins></a> inventions created by an AI can qualify for a patent. However, only earlier this month, US District Judge Leonie M Brinkema upheld a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-patent-office-artificial-intelligence-inventor-patent-221309654.html"><ins>decision by the US Patent and Trademark Office</ins></a> that said “only natural persons may be named as an inventor in a patent application.&quot; Judge Brinkema said there may eventually be a time when AI becomes sophisticated enough to satisfy the accepted definitions of inventorship, but noted, “that time has not yet arrived, and, if it does, it will be up to Congress to decide how, if at all, it wants to expand the scope of patent law.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-appeal-court-artificial-intelligence-patent-191631993.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a0f61a8-22ff-4e0f-beb9-2aac42652b8c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 19:16:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632424661</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T19:17:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44507a40-1ca1-11ec-af7e-f61faa6bcdca" width="4950" height="3300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/44507a40-1ca1-11ec-af7e-f61faa6bcdca" width="4950" height="3300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[oonal via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Patent pending files folder]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Patent pending files folder]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge update adds tab groups and new shopping features]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just ahead of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-release-date-132605467.html"><ins>Windows 11 launch</ins></a>, Microsoft is <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/09/23/our-top-new-features-are-designed-to-put-your-family-first/"><ins>rolling out</ins></a> some updates to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/edge"><ins>Edge</ins></a>.

When you&#39;re on a product page, click the blue tag on the address bar and you&#39;ll see expert reviews from reliable sources, as well as the average consumer star rating from various retailers.</p><p>When you do figure out what to buy, Microsoft aims to help you complete the transaction a bit faster. If you select a retailer&#39;s guest checkout option, you can click &quot;Try express checkout&quot; on the address bar. After you fill in your details manually one time, Edge can save them for future transactions on any shopping site. Once you&#39;re sure everything&#39;s accurate, click the &quot;Try all coupons and autofill details.&quot; Edge will then add your information and automatically find out if there are any coupons that can save you some cash, in a similar way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-paypal-buys-money-saving-service-honey.html"><ins>PayPal&#39;s Honey tool</ins></a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, Edge now has built-in travel recommendations. When you look up flights, you can click a notification on the address bar and you&#39;ll see suggestions of things to visit and do at your planned destination. The tool is only available in the US and on select booking sites for now, but it will be available elsewhere soon.</p><p>On top of that, it should be a bit faster for you to look for flights and hotels across multiple websites. Once you enter details on a booking site, Edge can store that info. It can then autofill the travel dates and so on when you visit another site. The company says it has improved flight search results in Bing too with the help of travel industry partners.</p><p>Elsewhere, the new personalized news feed called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-start-personalized-news-feed-164505328.html"><ins>Microsoft Start</ins></a> is integrated into the browser. You&#39;ll see headlines and articles relevant to your interests from a range of publishers when you open a new tab.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-edge-tab-groups-shopping-features-travel-news-185421812.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52fd96d1-c4d1-4d7c-8e04-40e5add5afa9</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 18:54:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632423266</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T18:54:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/26a74670-1c9e-11ec-ab3f-01e751891c2b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/26a74670-1c9e-11ec-ab3f-01e751891c2b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot of the Microsoft Edge browser that reads "You have saved $40 with Microsoft Edge."  new feature allows users to automatically check if any coupons are applicable while shopping.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge coupon feature]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter will make it easier to discover and listen to audio Spaces]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter will soon make Spaces even more prominent in its app as it looks to add more creator-focused tools to the live audio feature.
