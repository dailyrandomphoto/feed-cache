The two more expensive models, the Volt 276 and Volt 476, also have built-in analog 1176-type compressor circuits and presets for vocals, guitar. etc. The only thing missing is the digital signal processing (DSP) found in higher-end products like the Apollo lineup, though that&#39;s to be expected at these price points.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ec2948785d864e00b9019c833f1338d9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bRMoVt4zNOc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>UA isn&#39;t the first high-end gear maker to target bedroom producers, as Solid State Logic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-13-solid-state-logic-ssl-2-plus-audio-interface.html">recently unveiled</a> an affordable line of interfaces.

The company offers a range of designs at affordable prices that undercut much of the competition. What&#39;s more, Anker doesn&#39;t make many sacrifices when it comes to sound, performance and features to keep those prices low. Today, the company debuts the Liberty 3 Pro: a $170 follow-up to 2019&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-25-anker-soundcore-wireless-earbuds-liberty.html">Liberty 2 Pro</a> that adds active noise cancellation (ANC), improved audio and a refined design.&nbsp;</p><p>The Liberty 3 Pro has a similar look to the Liberty 2 Pro with silicone fit wings and a shape that&#39;s built to relieve pressure and discomfort. Anker says the new earbuds are 30 percent smaller than the previous model and they&#39;re IPX4 rated for moisture protection. On-board controls return to give you easy access to music and calls. Inside, the company explains that &quot;an upgraded dual driver configuration&quot; developed alongside nearly two dozen Grammy winning producers powers its &quot;best sounding model to date.&quot; Anker&#39;s Astria Coaxial Acoustic Architecture (ACAA) has been updated to version 2.0, enabling more detail without distortion. The Liberty 3 Pro also supports Sony&#39;s LDAC codec for wireless audio, a standard that transmits more data over Bluetooth for high-res listening.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0580f360-271b-11ec-bf11-cac4f42d60f8" alt="Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro" data-uuid="92df80be-8983-3bc5-8b1f-1a1cef1d582f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Anker/Soundcore</div></figure><p>The biggest addition here is ANC. The noise-cancelling setup employs Anker&#39;s HearID tech that can tailor the sound profile of the earbuds to your hearing. After a quick hearing test, HearID can increase certain frequencies that may be more difficult for you to hear in each ear. HearID also powers the active noise cancelling tech here, automatically customizing the level of noise reduction based on the clamor around you. Anker says the system creates an individual sound profile that accounts for in-ear pressure as well. The Liberty 3 Pro is also outfitted with AI-powered background noise reduction for calls and three ambient sound modes for a variety of scenarios.</p><p>Anker says the Liberty 3 Pro will last up to six hours on a charge with ANC on or up to eight hours with noise cancellation disabled. The included case supports wireless charging and holds up to three additional charges. A quick-charge feature will give you three hours of use in just 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>The Liberty 3 Pro is available today for $169.99 (£139.99/€159.99/$199.99 CAD) in black, white, gray and purple color options.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-liberty-3-pro-true-wireless-earbuds-100052557.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9ea8045a-383d-45c8-b036-bcdbe0c9c20b</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 10:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633576269</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T03:11:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/20629700-2703-11ec-b5af-ab9bd6f77a12" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/20629700-2703-11ec-b5af-ab9bd6f77a12" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anker/Soundcore]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sky's first smart TVs point to Comcast's box-less future]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sky’s long journey to move beyond satellite TV is finally over, as the company launches its brand new internet-only TV platform. <a href="https://www.sky.com/glass">Sky Glass</a> is the company’s first own-brand Smart TV, one which ditches the home-mounted satellite dish and set-top box in favor of pulling all of its content from the internet. The company’s pitch is to centralize not just its own content inside the one box, but to act as a universal platform for every streaming TV app currently available on the market. Not to mention that putting it all inside a single piece of hardware reduces the clutter that builds up underneath the family TV.</p><p>On the hardware front, Sky Glass comes in three sizes, 43-, 55- and 65-inch displays, all of which have 4K Quantum Dot LED screens with 10-bit HDR+ and Dolby Vision. It ships in five colors: Blue, White, Green, Pink or Black, with matching remote controls, speaker fascias and stands. On the audio front, Sky says that you won’t need a soundbar with this kit, since the hardware comes with six-speaker Dolby Atmos sound, as well as a subwoofer, built-in.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>(The company added that, consequently, Sky Glass is up to 50 percent more energy efficient than your current set-up since you’ll not be powering a discrete set-top-box and soundbar.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/673be4b0-2753-11ec-a38b-3c22fc2bf4d1" style="height:1201;width:1800;" alt="Image of the new Sky Glass voice remote" data-uuid="600bcfd9-d1db-3d19-a30d-49d1a078bf07"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sky</div></figure><p>But Sky’s value proposition isn’t just that it’s selling a fancy TV with some streaming bits inside, but a whole new way to end the infinite scroll. With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-29-sky-q-review.html">Sky Q,</a> the company already positioned itself as a curation layer between you and the content you want, but this takes it a big step forward. It’s designed to aggregate all of the catalogs from all of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-netflix-is-now-available-on-sky-q-boxes.html">streaming apps</a> available and let you pick and choose what you want from one centralized location. That means you can watch episodes of the same TV series, in order, even if they’re hosted on different streaming platforms.</p><p>Sky Glass is also voice-activated, with the wake word ‘Hello Sky,” and you should be able to access all of your favorite shoes, live TV and play listed content with it. But if you’d prefer, you can use the new remote, which is a simplified version of the touch remote already available for Sky Q, albeit with backlit buttons for better night-time operation.</p><p>At the same time, Sky also announced a 4K webcam which it is planning to release at some point in the future which will sit on top of the TV and offer Portal-esque video calls. This system also offers motion-tracking and skeleton tracking for both motion gaming and customized workouts, and it even looks like a Kinect. When this hardware is available, you’ll also be able to have watching parties for live TV even when you’re not in the same location.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/83e9f700-2753-11ec-bfff-3d3befa6701e" style="height:1013;width:1800;" alt="Image of three sizes of Sky Glass TV" data-uuid="283c77cd-d1ce-3fb7-bfe5-d6a9b67db071"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sky</div></figure><p>Of course, given that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-22-comcast-to-acquire-sky.html">Sky is owned by Comcast</a> and the company is rumored to be working on its own TV platform, you can assume for yourself that a rebranded version of Sky Glass is coming to the US. <a href="https://www.protocol.com/comcast-xclass-tv-hisense"><em>Protocol</em></a> reports that Comcast has been working on a product, dubbed the XClass TV, for the US market. In addition, Sky says that Glass will not just be available in the UK and Europe, but also in Australia and other markets across the next year or so.</p><p>Price-wise, Sky Glass will cost £649, £849 or £1,049 depending on if you opt for the 43-, 55- or 65-inch version. But the company says that it expects more people to buy it on a monthly subscription contract, much as it does with phones via Sky Mobile, for a minimum contract term. In that instance, the hardware will set you back £13, £17, or £21 per month, depending on which size you opt for.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sky-smart-tv-glass-comcast-095543008.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ec92515-ceef-4579-afae-189ee2be6f29</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 09:55:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633600548</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T09:56:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4e80de80-2753-11ec-b97f-00b4ce7886d5" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4e80de80-2753-11ec-b97f-00b4ce7886d5" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sky]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Promotional image of Sky Glass]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sky Glass]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch says 'server configuration change' led to massive data leak]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitch has <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/10/06/updates-on-the-twitch-security-incident/">released an update</a> on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-data-breach-reveals-creator-payouts-source-code-and-more-112012011.html">massive hack</a> that appears to have exposed source code, streamer payment figures and other information.

Yes, you&#39;ll play a firefighter in Bernard&#39;s new 2D action-adventure game entitled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1662480/Nuclear_Blaze/"><em>Nuclear Blaze</em></a> — one who gets air-dropped into a secret military facility that went up in flames for unknown reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>In the complex, you&#39;ll have to use your firehose wisely to deal with the wildfire spreading uncontrollably throughout each section.

The game company has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxnr2FAADAs">posted</a> a Steam Deck teardown video that shows how to pry open the handheld console while simultaneously urging you to keep the system shut. It&#39;s certainly possible to get in — it&#39;s just that you might just cause more problems than you solve.</p><p>As Valve explains, the Steam Deck is tightly packed with highly customized parts, including the thumbsticks. While the company is promising replacements for various parts in the &quot;coming months,&quot; there are chances you&#39;ll damage the system on your way in through static electricity or other mishaps. There can also be consequences to using off-the-shelf parts. A stock SSD might interfere with the handheld&#39;s thermals, for instance. You might even compromise the integrity of the console just by opening it, according to Valve.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This likely won&#39;t deter you if you insist on fixing your Steam Deck yourself. Valve clearly expects at least some unofficial repair attempts given its parts plan. However, it&#39;s evident the <em>Half-Life</em> maker wants you to rely on Valve&#39;s own technicians, or at least third-party pros, in the event the Deck breaks. This machine isn&#39;t the poster child for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-right-to-repair-policy-statement-203721173.html">right to repair advocates</a>, even if it&#39;s easier to fix than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-31-apple-airpods-pro-non-repairable.html">other devices</a>.</p><div id="085361080a464753b78ed882be17e8dc"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dxnr2FAADAs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-teardown-211025030.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5b709d3-0ff9-46ce-a737-d34b8f0ea241</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 21:10:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633554630</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T21:10:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d1d11e10-26e2-11ec-a7ea-707618b93fb7" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d1d11e10-26e2-11ec-a7ea-707618b93fb7" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valve, YouTube]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Valve Steam Deck teardown]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Valve Steam Deck teardown]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AT&T is reportedly One America News' primary financial backer]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Telecoms have long been accused of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-25-att-verizon-lobbying-fcc-600mhz-spectrum.html">trying to skew politics</a>, but a new report suggests AT&amp;T might have gone further than most. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712479/att-one-america-news-network-herring-conservative-news-channel-agreement">According</a> to <em>The Verge</em>, <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-oneamerica-att/">reports</a> that AT&amp;T is a major backer for One America News Network (OAN), a right-wing media outlet <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-suspends-one-american-news-network-221244594.html">YouTube temporarily banned</a> last November for spreading misinformation. While multiple TV providers carry the channel, an OAN accountant testified in 2020 that 90 percent of OAN parent Herring Networks&#39; revenue, tens of millions of dollars, came through deals with AT&amp;T-owned platforms that included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-direc-tv-spinoff-051610804.html">DirecTV</a>.</p><p>OAN founder Robert Herring separately testified that AT&amp;T executives inspired him to launch the network in 2013 after looking at a media landscape with relatively few conservative outlets. Court documents also indicated that AT&amp;T offered to buy a 5 percent equity stake in OAN and Herring&#39;s lifestyle channel AWE, although the two ended up choosing a different agreement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>OAN even claimed that one AT&amp;T executive, Aaron Slator, offered to put the channel on DirecTV in return for help lobbying for the satellite broadcaster&#39;s 2014 merger. The Herring family also supposedly met FCC officials to talk about the merger and speak well of AT&amp;T in news stories. AT&amp;T has denied making the offer linked to Slator, and an OAN lawsuit alleging a breach of that deal supposedly led to AT&amp;T adding OAN to DirecTV&#39;s selection.</p><p>AT&amp;T rejected claims of undue influence in responses to <em>Reuters</em> and <em>The Verge</em>. The carrier maintained that DirecTV &quot;does not dictate&quot; channel programming, and that DirecTV merger support was &quot;never a condition of or part of&quot; any content carriage agreement. In a Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/ATTNEWS/status/1445828767113416706">statement</a>, AT&amp;T maintained it &quot;never had a financial interest&quot; in OAN and that the decision to carry the network was now in DirecTV&#39;s hands.</p><p>The concern, as you might imagine, is that AT&amp;T may have contributed to the spread of misinformation without being held to account like online providers and other companies. On top of YouTube suspending OAN following a violation of COVID-19 misinformation rules, voting machine maker Dominion <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/10/1026509404/dominion-sues-conservative-media-oan-newsmax-2020-election">sued the network</a> in August this year over unproven claims of election fraud. If the report is accurate, there could easily be pressure on AT&amp;T to distance itself from OAN and focus more on its core services than politics.</p><div id="8e63a82fd41745d587abdf18ee98d6f6"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">AT&amp;T&#39;s statement on today&#39;s Reuters story on OAN <a href="https://t.co/8pb8Poj8IC">pic.twitter.com/8pb8Poj8IC</a></p>— AT&amp;T News (@ATTNEWS) <a href="https://twitter.com/ATTNEWS/status/1445828767113416706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/att-oan-financial-backing-200155294.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5674e66-5285-4072-a5f2-fedc712a2f04</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 20:01:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633551073</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T20:11:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/69193700-26e1-11ec-b36f-1f6fb81377bd" width="5253" height="3502" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/69193700-26e1-11ec-b36f-1f6fb81377bd" width="5253" height="3502" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ronald Martinez/Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An AT&T office high-rise building on an overcast day with clouds surrounding the top floors.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[1212246315 AT&T building]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter tests warnings about 'intense' conversations on iOS and Android]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before you jump into a feisty Twitter thread about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kingdom-hearts-sora-super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-140938432.html">Sora being the last <em>Super Smash Bros.

(Twitter said it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-spaces-discovery-recording-180717328.html">in the works a few weeks ago</a>.) On top of the intensity warning, there&#39;s also a screen that highlights a few golden rules of online conversations: remember there&#39;s a person on the other side; focus on facts; and consider the value of different opinions, which could help strengthen your perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Similar to Birdwatch, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-birdwatch-misinformation-182940288.html">Twitter&#39;s community-driven push</a> to fight misinformation with informed context, the Heads Up feature is an attempt at empowering the company&#39;s users. It&#39;s tough to prevent toxic conversations entirely, and this is one way to opt out of a potentially contentious argument. (Life is too short to argue with some gaming fandoms, after all.)

Apple <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=mdkbobfo">says</a> that as of January 31st, all app submissions (including updates) will need to include the option.</p><p>The company announced this <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#5.1.1">requirement</a> alongside other App Store guideline changes at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2021-event-roundup-212428441.html">Apple Worldwide Developers Conference</a> in June as part of a push to give users more control over their data. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712795/apple-developer-account-deletion-app-reporting"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, Apple is only requiring developers to let people &quot;initiate deletion of their account from within the app,&quot; so apps might send you to a website or even a chat with an agent before you can actually close your account.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It remains to be seen how useful this requirement will actually be in practice, given the <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-spot-avoid-dark-patterns/">tricks</a> many developers employ to encourage you to remain as a user. Still, if you have an account in an app, deleting it will be slightly less of a headache, which can&#39;t be a bad thing.

RTS,S, also known as Mosquirix. Specifically, the WHO says it should be deployed for children in sub-Saharan Africa and other areas where with moderate to high malaria transmission. The announcement follows in the footsteps of huge vaccine advancements around the COVID-19 pandemic. To be clear, though, RTS,S isn&#39;t an mRNA vaccine, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-mrna-tech-we-used-against-covid-could-help-us-finally-beat-malaria-153045965.html">have the potential to make an even bigger impact </a>on malaria and other diseases that have affected humans for ages.</p><p>“This is a historic moment. The long-awaited malaria vaccine for children is a breakthrough for science, child health and malaria control,” WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. “Using this vaccine on top of existing  tools to prevent malaria could save tens of thousands of young lives each year.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>RTS,S has an efficacy rate of preventing 39 percent against malaria cases and 29 percent of severe cases, based on trials in Africa involving small children. That may seem particularly low, but when combined with other anti-malarial tools, like bed netting with insecticide, the WHO says the vaccine could potentially save tens of thousands of lives annually. The organization estimates that more than 260,000 African children (out of around 500,000 people total) die from malaria every year.</p><p>Crucially, the WHO also says RTS,S can be deployed easily, is safe to use and is cost effective to roll out. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/oct/06/who-endorses-use-of-worlds-first-malaria-vaccine-in-africa">According to The Guardian</a>, the company behind the vaccine, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), says it will supply up to 15 million doses annual at no more than 5 percent of the production cost. The WHO and GSK are looking for additional sources of funding from partners and governments.&nbsp;</p><p>RTS,S is just the start, though. Thanks to mRNA-based technology, which can teach our bodies how to respond to specific diseases, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-04-23-malaria-vaccine-becomes-first-achieve-who-specified-75-efficacy-goal">Oxford University&#39;s R21 vaccine </a>is up to 77 percent effective when it comes to preventing malaria. And based on tests so far, it&#39;s proven to be safe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;For centuries, malaria has stalked sub-Saharan Africa, causing immense personal suffering,” Dr Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said in a statement. “Today’s recommendation offers a glimmer of hope for the continent which shoulders the heaviest burden of the disease and we expect many more African children to be protected from malaria and grow into healthy adults.”</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/who-approves-first-malaria-vaccine-africa-191356314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c09ed25f-d058-4a88-a652-23e2db312725</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 19:13:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633581633</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T04:40:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Epidemic & Plague]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d57a8290-26d8-11ec-abd8-fae8b233b420" width="3300" height="2150" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d57a8290-26d8-11ec-abd8-fae8b233b420" width="3300" height="2150" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[panom via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aedes mosquitoe is sucking blood on human skin.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aedes mosquitoe is sucking blood on human skin]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro can now boost other people's voices during conversations]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It can sometimes come across as rude when you leave your earbuds in while chatting with someone.

That&#39;s a record for the company, and comes close to the $750 million Amazon received to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-13-amazons-hq2-split-between-nyc-arlington-virginia.html">build its second headquarters</a>.</p><p>The largest incentive was a $322 million, 12-year property tax abatement pending in Markham, Illinois, followed by a nearly $151 million, 15-year tax exemption package in Monroe County, New York. Good Jobs First said this was likely a cautious estimate as some of the deals involve undisclosed tax deals and grants.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The payouts came despite an uncertain economy and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-settles-employees-working-condition-criticisms-090134228.html">complaints about Amazon&#39;s working conditions</a>, including modest pay, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-warehouse-policies-020626313.html">strict monitoring</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-automated-injuries-211813202.html">high injury rates</a>. Officials may attract more jobs to their area, but they won&#39;t necessarily be high-quality jobs that grow the economy. It&#39;s also unclear if there&#39;s a net job benefit — <em>FT</em> cited an Economic Policy Institute study showing that an Amazon warehouse attracted workers from other companies rather than expanding the overall workforce.</p><p>Amazon has justified the incentives through overall job creation and economic investment. In a statement, the company said it created over 400,000 jobs in 2020 alongside a $150 billion investment. It added that it was often taking incentives available to any company settling into a given location, not just Amazon.</p><p>Even if there is an overall employment increase, though, the question is whether or not Amazon should be accepting tax incentives in the first place. The company made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-q1-2021-210221698.html">more profit in the first year of the pandemic</a> than it did in the previous three years, raking in $26.9 billion. The firm doesn&#39;t exactly need those tax breaks to survive, and the money could be used to improve communities and working conditions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-us-tax-breaks-delivery-171657659.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c59ec4f7-a4ed-49a5-ba86-c46a2c4ec22c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 17:16:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633540621</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T17:20:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Budget, Tax & Economy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/19e16bf0-26c1-11ec-bf67-f482aa14316a" width="7551" height="5034" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/19e16bf0-26c1-11ec-bf67-f482aa14316a" width="7551" height="5034" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MediaNews Group/The Riverside Press-Enterprise via Getty Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[EASTVALE, CA - AUGUST 31: A worker sorts out packages in the outbound dock at Amazon fulfillment center in Eastvale on Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2021.

It’s the little things that are simple to overlook. I say that with the confidence of someone that just migrated over from a decade-old iMac to a part-picked PC. The rig I ended up with is solid, I had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/keychron-q-1-fully-customizable-keyboard-130015959.html">a nice keyboard</a> already, but oh boy do I really need a new mouse.</p><p>Mice are not sexy computer peripherals. But if, like me, you spend at least eight hours a day with your hand on one, they’re more important than we give them credit for. My old Magic Mouse could have made the move from MacOS to Windows, but I was already negotiating some pretty bad RSI and the internal battery was starting to waiver. Not least of all, I wanted something that I could charge and use at the same time — the temerity, I know.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Not to mention, since the advent of devices such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-stream-deck-mk2-trailer-details-faceplates-235437088.html">Stream Deck</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loupedeck-live-versus-the-stream-deck-170020781.html">Loupedeck Live</a> I have developed a taste for physical, assignable controls. Also, as a recent convert to the world of mechanical keyboards, I was hoping there was a similar world of boutique, bespoke options. It turns out that mice are still a largely off-the-shelf affair, but I was determined to get through some of the more promising options and find something I could live with, possibly for another decade.</p><p>My requirements? Fairly simple, but a little more than just something I can comfortably click links with. Top of the list: Ergonomics. The Magic Mouse is… fine, but a little low profile for my palming style. Given my RSI was exclusively in my mousing arm, I figured there’s a good chance ergonomics were to blame.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2cd9abb0-2698-11ec-aabf-9494c8a65d2d" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="dd53e931-71ca-33f0-93e7-8fbb6c05bc2e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Second: I want something that is reasonably configurable. I don’t need to pull off several complex gaming moves; I just want to have things like volume control or the ability to switch between desktops at my fingertips. Thirdly, battery life. I am trying to lose as many cables as I can, so the longer I can go between charging/without a cable around, the better.</p><p>That’s kinda it. It’s not a big ask but I soon learned there was always some mental bargaining going on trying to find the best balance. I also wanted to see what a modern mouse can offer <em>beyond</em> those requirements as, who knows, maybe there’s something I never knew I wanted or I have the sudden urge to get into Dota 2. Enter, the story I thought I’d never write: An 11-way  PC mouse shoot out.</p><h2>The obvious candidates</h2><p>Google around for “the best PC mouse” and you’ll find one answer: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s MX Master 3" href="https://amzn.to/3a67xI4">Logitech’s MX Master 3</a>. You might see a few mentions of others — like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Razer Pro Click" href="https://amzn.to/3Fm2npG">Razer Pro Click</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Microsoft&#x002019;s Surface Precision" href="https://amzn.to/2WMn0do">Microsoft’s Surface Precision</a> mouse — but the reviews are clear that the MX 3 Master is the one.</p><p>I looked at all three of these, and honestly, there’s not a lot in it. All of them cost $100 and all of them meet my basic requirements of decent ergonomics, configurable buttons and solid battery life. The latter is the hardest to quantify thanks to how each manufacturer likes to define “time.” For Logi’s MX 3 Master it’s “70 days.” Razer on the other hand touts the Pro Click as lasting between 200 and 400 hours depending on whether you use their USB dongle or Bluetooth respectively (that’s 8-16 “days” but it’s not clear if this is “in use”).</p><p>Microsoft’s Surface Precision is listed as “up to 3 months” which I somehow read with an implied shrug on their part. It’s hard to know whether those are active use or “the mouse is on and it’s on your desk.” The better news is that all of them can be charged while you use them. In practice, I found the MX Master 3 to last the longest, but also needing a charge way sooner than its 70 days claim (I’ve had it here barely a month and already had need to charge it).</p><p>Of this trio, the Pro Click offers the most configurable buttons (8). The MX Master 3 is a close second (7) but has the advantage of a second scroll wheel near the thumb. In reality, two of Razer’s “buttons” are side-clicks on the scroll wheel — typically these default to sideways scroll, the same as Logi’s thumb dial does. The net result is that I found the MX Master 3 slightly more configurable for my use cases. The thumbwheel is perfect for switching between desktops — something I do a lot, which would occupy two slots on the Razer meaning, effectively, the MX Master 3 has one more spare button in this setup.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/504ed1b0-2698-11ec-adfb-ef6758e9ac20" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="c67786a8-e83c-33f8-8380-ad0134a4f795"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Additionally, there’s a button on the MX master 3 located just under where your thumb rests. This can be used for almost anything, but by default, it activates something called “gesture control,” which lets you assign certain tasks to, you guessed it, different gestures. I gave the gesture controls a spin and they seemed pretty helpful, but the usefulness soon dissolved when I found I wasn’t always able to ace the gesture on the first attempt.</p><p>For its part, Microsoft’s Surface Precision mouse offers six buttons and includes left/right clicks on the scroll wheel, putting it about on par with Razer and a shade under the MX Master 3 for configuration dorks like me.</p><p>All three companies offer companion software — Microsoft’s is built right-in to Windows. It’s worth noting that Logitech makes a distinction between its office mice and its gaming mice which I’ll get to later (basically, different software with different configuration options). The short version is each gets its own software and what you can do there differs which will be a key factor if considering a variety of their models..</p><p>I found Logitech’s Options software the most straightforward with a deep selection of Windows commands, media controls, shortcuts and navigation tools on offer. You can also assign keystroke combinations if something you need isn’t listed. On top of that there are options for app-specific buttons which means you can, for example, have right-click do one thing in Photoshop but something totally different in Chrome. Logitech doesn’t offer full macros in Options though, so more complex commands are off the table via the native software.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f93a3a30-2698-11ec-9b7d-1a65560ee9b0" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="68848bf7-01cf-3a96-a493-2ce6ac67fb4a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Razer’s Synapse also offers app-specific controls alongside a wealth of predefined media and OS shortcuts, but perhaps less comprehensive than those found in Options. That said, you do also have full macro support: Simply hit record and whatever you do next can be converted into a single click of the mouse. There’s even “HyperShift” which means you can add a second layer of commands while holding down an allocated button.</p><p>Microsoft’s Mouse and Keyboard Center is no slouch either with some decent shortcuts on offer and support for both macros and app-specific controls. Though, overall, it’s perhaps less in-depth than both Logitech and Razer’s companion apps.</p><p>On a more minor note. During my time with MacOS I joined the dark side of “natural scroll.” It’s not a deal-breaker for me, as I don’t mind regular scroll, but Logitech and Microsoft both offer reverse scrolling as a setting, Razer doesn’t appear to — though you can work around this <a href="https://www.highrez.co.uk/downloads/xmousebuttoncontrol.htm">in other ways</a> of course.</p><p>All the above mice offer the flexibility of both Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless connectivity, can be used while cabled and support multi-device (at the same time) modes, if that’s your thing.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> Tie between MX Master 3 and Pro Click.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3a67xI4" id="c3d7ca84756a403dbdc7d142b49a9963" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MX Master 3 at Amazon - $100</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Fm2npG" id="77b08c50bd5c434f845b41a2f90d7135" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Razer Pro Click at Amazon - $100</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2WMn0do" id="8ebc85ef19234e5b8b041ead4e575e88" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Surface Precision mouse at Amazon - $100</a><h2>Gaming mice for everyday use</h2><p>Just because a mouse has a gaming focus, it doesn’t mean it’s no good for productivity. That was my reasoning when I looked at things like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech G502 Lightspeed" href="https://amzn.to/3Bd2iST">Logitech G502 Lightspeed</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:G Pro X Superlight" href="https://amzn.to/3mqkDpj">G Pro X Superlight</a>. From Razer, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Viper Ultimate" href="https://amzn.to/3iBLBJE">Viper Ultimate</a> looked like another strong option.</p><p>There are a few things that change once you go gamer it seems. First: Things get much much lighter. The heaviest I tried was the G502 which, at 114g is a hair heavier than the Razer Pro Click (106g). But 26g lighter than the MX Master 3. The G Pro X Superlight and the Viper Ultra are much more svelte however, weighing in at 63g and 74g respectively. This puts the G Pro X at under half the weight of its Logitech productivity sibling.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/332e3200-2699-11ec-86ff-53c61ea2020f" alt="The Logitech G502 has a lot of configurable options, especially aimed at gamers." data-uuid="be203487-e08f-3009-8009-f0ac8267620b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The next thing to consider is the form factor. Gaming mice are much more likely to have either a neutral or ambidextrous design. This isn’t a no-no for my RSI concerns (especially when offset against the lighter weight) but it was something I was cautious about. Of the ones I am testing here, the G502 Lightspeed is the most “ergonomic.”</p><p>Lastly, gamers want speed and even 2.4GHz is a bit too laggy for some, so Bluetooth connectivity is rare to find in this category. That’s not a deal-breaker for me, but worth knowing in case it is for you.</p><p>I actually had high hopes for the G502 Lightspeed. Not only is it lighter and a similar form factor to the MX Master 3, it offers a whopping 11 configurable buttons. What’s more you’re able to assign full macros along with a slew of deep keyboard commands to those buttons. From a customization standpoint, it’s pretty comprehensive. The G502’s office-bound rival has most of what you need, but macros aren’t there and the keyboard commands on offer aren’t as extensive as in Logitech’s gamer-focused G Hub software.</p><p>I should mention the G Pro X Superlight here, too, given it uses the same software as the G502. The G Pro X is semi ambidextrous (you can palm it with either hand, but the extra buttons are only on one side). There are only five buttons total, too.</p><p>The issue for me was really all in the handling. I liked that both of these were lighter, that’s a solid plus. But the wealth of buttons on the G502 meant things were a little more cramped. For example, there are two right alongside the left-click button and then another two just above where your thumb rests. They aren’t hard to locate without looking, but overall not as naturally placed as those on the MX Master 3, at least in my opinion. Also, the scroll wheel on both the G502 and the G Pro X protrudes more than any of the other mice on this list which, again, takes some getting used to. Neither was as fluid or comfortable to me as those in the MX Master 3 or Razer Pro click.</p><p>Moreover, the G502 has a button to switch between smooth and ratchet scroll (fast, free gliding versus clicky slow, basically). The MX Master 3 offers both types of scrolling but with a setting where ratchet mode will seamlessly become smooth mode which is much more apt for browsing and navigating lists. I found scrolling on the G502 a bit annoying. Much bigger “clicks” and finding the button to switch to smooth seemed to kill my flow. I am guessing it’s better for gamers though.</p><p>The G Pro X, for its part, is a really nice option if you want something light with a couple of extra buttons. But with just two additional ones over the standard two-plus-clickwheel it wasn’t quite up to my requirements.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6c117d20-2699-11ec-bffe-e297a55ec7df" alt="Razer&#39;s Viper is a surprisingly good mouse for general productivity." data-uuid="23fbb9e7-c037-3ac5-a59a-be420c671d81"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Razer’s Viper Ultimate, literally on the other hand, is a surprisingly competent all-purpose mouse. For one, as alluded to, it’s truly ambidextrous. At 74g it glides across the desk making it a pleasure to use for extended periods. With a 70 hour battery life it was joint first with the G Pro X for longevity in this category (the G502 offers around 50 hours).</p><p>The main nitpick for me with the Viper is that the two buttons near your ring finger and pinkie take a little getting used to if you palm a mouse like I do. I had to train myself to click with the side of my finger rather than the tip. The net result is that I was surprised to find myself gravitating toward the Viper Ultimate most out of this category, despite the G502 being closer to what I had in mind when setting out on this test.</p><p>Thanks to gamery specs that I’m not going to make use of, such as 20,000+ DPI sensors and 1000Hz polling rates, all of the gaming mice do cost more than the “productivity” options. In fact all three cost the same: $150.</p><p><strong>Winner:</strong> Razer Viper Ultimate</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Bd2iST" id="8f37f1a6e30d45beafe4318f0e19755e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy G502 Lightspeed at Amazon - $150</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3mqkDpj" id="064e4b882bc34181a0b5291ba6a6434c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy G Pro X Superlight at Amazon - $150</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3iBLBJE" id="4bc2bd2b53dc49e9a8d9e5a4cbde8afe" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Viper Ultimate at Amazon - $150</a><h2>Mobile mice</h2><p>Let’s be clear, there’s almost no chance any of the mobile mice on offer would make a great full-time desktop replacement. That said, it’s also one of the more interesting categories thanks to being free from the burden of having to do <em>everything</em>. A mobile mouse can get a little wackier and do one or two things really well.</p><p>There’s also the fact that many of us are working at home on the company laptop, so pairing that with a mouse can make the transition back to the office a little smoother (and not everyone is a fan of trackpads anyway). As such, a straight head-to-head feels less appropriate, but here’s a rundown of five contenders.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0532d800-269a-11ec-affb-68b8ee0e5893" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="2aa4fef7-ff79-3a60-95c0-1e8293a3f62e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><h3>Logitech Pebble</h3><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech&#x002019;s Pebble" href="https://amzn.to/3DsVIbN">Logitech’s Pebble</a> is a mobile mouse in the purest form. At 100g it’s not the lightest on this list, but that does give it a reassuring feel in use. There are only three buttons: The standard left click, right click and click wheel. You also have the choice between Bluetooth and 2.4GHz dongle connectivity. A nice touch is that you can stow the USB dongle under the top plate as that’s also where you’ll change the (AA) battery.</p><p>The Pebble has a slight angle to it which felt like my hand was arching forward when in use. The ambidextrous design is welcome but I do have my concerns about how comfortable it is for extended use. The two aces up the Pebble’s sleeve, however, are its epic battery life: A claimed 18 months (though this will obviously depend on what batteries you use) and the $25 price tag, making it the cheapest on this list.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DsVIbN" id="8fe59378955a4a6cb239b55a2fcc033c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Logitech Pebble at Amazon - $30</a><h3>Logitech MX Anywhere 3</h3><p>As the name suggests, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MX Anywhere 3" href="https://amzn.to/3B8HAU9">MX Anywhere 3</a> is the mobile version of the MX Master 3. Unlike its bigger brother, the Anywhere has a semi-ambidextrous design. It’s perhaps a shade too small to cut it as desktop replacement, but in the mobile realm it feels premium, complete with the auto-switching between ratchet and free-flowing scroll wheel — which at $80, it should.</p><p>With six buttons, it’s pretty configurable for something so small and at 99g it won’t overstay its welcome under your palm. Though for the life of me I cannot understand why there is no option to stow the USB dongle inside the mouse somewhere. Given its mobile nature this seems like a no-brainer. You can, of course, just use Bluetooth if, like me, USB dongles seem to vanish into thin air unless they have a home.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3B8HAU9" id="56e4d89225e94013a2d4ea7b0058ea98" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MX Anywhere 3 at Amazon - $80</a><h3>Razer Orochi V2</h3><p>The winner of the most forgettable-looking option in this nest of mice goes to the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Orochi V2" href="https://amzn.to/2YiJ5kf">Orochi V2</a>. Or maybe it’s just understated? Especially for a Razer product. Looks aside, the Orochi V2 is a very capable mobile mouse with six buttons, Bluetooth or dongle connectivity and it works with Razer’s Synapse software, so any macros you might already have can be assigned here (or make your own!).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1ce065d0-269a-11ec-bfbf-883f3747708a" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="977e0eb1-a614-3875-aa48-fdab6441b2d1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>At 425 (2.4Ghz) or 950 hours (BLE) you get a decent amount of time out of each battery and you can use either a single AA or AAA. It weighs just 60g, so it’s also pretty nimble. At $70, it’s edging into full-desktop mouse territory, but given that it’s big enough to actually use this full time, that seems less surprising. Especially given that you can stow the dongle under the top cover, which is more than can be said for the MX Anywhere 3 (or even the MX Master 3).</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2YiJ5kf" id="0f3e5990afa54bf397eb3ef492c6df4f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Razer Orochi V2 at Amazon - $70</a><h3>Microsoft Surface Arc</h3><p>Who was betting on Microsoft having the most stylish mouse on this list? The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Surface Arc" href="https://amzn.to/3uGNLMT">Surface Arc</a> is a delight with a “transforming” design that pops into shape (an “arc” no less). Once you’re done simply snap it flat again for easy storage in a pocket of your laptop bag. You don’t even need to turn it on as “snapping” it also acts as a power switch. Oh, and did I mention that the touchpad area does double duty as left/right click and vertical or sideways scroll (Magic Mouse style)? There’s even the option for a “triple” click to give the Surface Arc an extra, assignable button. All that, and it’s only around $55.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/40e98e70-269a-11ec-b5dd-389b0f705426" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="b2beab99-9d40-3fb3-ae90-7dd37fc4b703"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As satisfying as it is to click into shape, the hollow area under the arc does mean that your thumb and little finger don’t have anywhere to naturally rest. I also found the curve of the arc led me more into a claw position over my usual palm, which might be okay for you but gave me pause about using this for longer periods. As a purely mobile mouse, though, it’s one of the more pleasing, especially if you like its semi-trackpad nature.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3uGNLMT" id="ad1f317c28644ef78b5e1bdddef4159a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Microsoft Surface Arc at Amazon - $50</a><h3>Microsoft Modern Mobile mouse</h3><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Modern Mobile mouse" href="https://amzn.to/3ovHLp7">Modern Mobile mouse</a> is Microsoft’s answer to the Pebble. Streamlined, lightweight and with a focus on the basics. There’s no 2.4GHz option here though; it’s Bluetooth only. At $35, compared to the Pebble’s $25 it might seem a foregone conclusion but there’s a lot to like about Microsoft’s take on a portable mouse.</p><p>For one, its build quality feels far superior. It also looks more stylish (if that matters). More importantly, it has a more neutral position that feels really comfortable for a smaller mouse and doesn’t feel like it’s craning my hand forward. Throw in the fact that you can still assign app-specific controls via Microsoft’s Mouse and Keyboard center and you end up with something that’s smarter than it first seems.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ovHLp7" id="f4d8648b572542bb8d34494b966a843f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Modern Mobile mouse at Amazon - $35</a><h2>Conclusion</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6c0a0da0-269a-11ec-be46-7eeed37a001b" alt="Mouse buyer&#39;s guide." data-uuid="14dd7979-60d7-309e-8894-33d703d65cc4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>If nothing else, I was surprised by the diversity of options despite my initial concern to the contrary. Who knew that Microsoft had such style, at least in the mobile category? Likewise, Razer, it turns out, makes surprisingly adept productivity mice despite its true-green gamer aesthetic. Logitech, on the other hand, is a steady hand across all categories.</p><p>Predictably, the MX Master 3 does seem to do most of the things I want. BUT, only really thanks to that thumbwheel. It is particularly suited for what I need. That said, I find myself quite taken by the Pro Click, and despite lacking a second scroll wheel, it pretty much matches the MX Master 3 in every other manner. It’s also lighter which is a small positive in its favor.</p><p>For those that prefer lightweight options (something that became more appealing to me the more I tested), then the Viper Ultimate from Razer impressed me with its balance of function and form. If you don’t need as many buttons then Logitech’s Pro X Superlight lives up to its name. I could happily live with either of these mice full time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-mice-pc-gaming-mobile-150027822.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c8f67888-7dba-4fba-8d3c-71a6571a9970</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 15:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633530766</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T14:32:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/858405c0-2694-11ec-9eae-3a66b73c0d08" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/858405c0-2694-11ec-9eae-3a66b73c0d08" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PC Mouse buyer's guide.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PC Mouse buyer's guide]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's owner buys SteelSeries to expand into gaming gear]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Add SteelSeries to the ranks of gaming hardware brands <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-12-logitech-astro-console-headset-gaming-acquisition.html">selling themselves to larger tech firms</a>.

Her background as part of the company’s civic integrity team meant she was intimately familiar with some of the biggest problems on Facebook.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>During the hearing, Haugen spoke in detail about Facebook’s algorithms and other internal systems that have hampered its efforts to slow misinformation and other problematic content. She also praised the company’s researchers, calling them “heroes,” and said Facebook should be required to make their work public.</p><h2>Remove algorithmic ranking and go back to chronological feeds</h2><p>One of the most notable aspects of Haugen’s testimony was her expertise, which gives her a nuanced understanding of how algorithms work and the often unintended consequences of using them.</p><p>“I hope we will discuss as to whether there is such a thing as a safe algorithm,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal said at the start of the hearing. While Haugen never addressed that question directly, she did weigh on the ranking algorithms that power the feeds in Facebook and Instagram. She noted that Facebook’s own research has found that “engagement-based ranking on Instagram can lead children from very innocuous topics like healthy recipes… to anorexia-promoting content over a very short period of time.”</p><p>She also said that Facebook’s AI-based moderation tools were much less effective than what the company has publicly portrayed. “We&#39;ve seen from repeated documents within my disclosures that Facebook&#39;s AI systems only catch a very tiny minority of offending content,” Haugen said. “Best case scenario, in the case of something like hate speech, at most they will ever get to 10 to 20%.”</p><p>To address this, Haugen said that Facebook could move to a chronological feed where posts are ordered by recency, rather than what is most likely to get engagement. “I&#39;m a strong proponent of chronological ranking, or ordering by time with a little bit of spam demotion, because I think we don&#39;t want computers deciding what we focus on,” Haugen said.</p><p>She noted that Facebook would likely resist such a plan because content that gets more engagement is better for their platform because it causes people to post and comment more. “I&#39;ve spent most of my career working on systems like engagement-based ranking,” Haugen said. “When I come to you and say these things, I’m basically damning 10 years of my own work.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b1dcb470-2660-11ec-b6f3-98232b6723a6" alt="Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) centre speaks as Facebook Global Head of Safety Director, Antigone Davis, testifies remotely before a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security to examine protecting children online, focusing on Facebook, Instagram, and mental health harms, on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, September 30, 2021.

She also noted that using the law to police Facebook’s algorithms could be easier than trying to address specific types of content. “User generated content is something that companies have less control over, they have 100% control over their algorithms,” Haugen said.</p><p>The focus on Section 230 is significant because lawmakers from both parties have proposed various changes to the law. During the hearing, Blumenthal indicated that he too supported “narrowing this sweeping immunity when platforms’ algorithms amplify illegal conduct.” Senator Amy Klobuchar has also proposed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/health-misinformation-act-2021-204010072.html">ending 230 protections</a> for vaccine and health misinformation. Meanwhile, Republicans have tried to eliminate Section 230 for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trump-executive-order-social-media-section-230-144905272.html">very different</a> reasons.</p><h2>Slow down virality</h2><p>Likewise, Haugen suggested that Facebook should slow down its platform with “soft interventions” that would add small bits of friction to the platform. She pointed to Twitter’s “read before sharing” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-read-before-sharing-ios-143931229.html">prompts </a>as the kind of measure that can reduce the spread of misinformation.</p><p>“Small actions like that friction don&#39;t require picking good ideas and bad ideas,” she said. “They just make the platform less twitchy, less reactive. And Facebook&#39;s internal research says that each one of those small actions dramatically reduces misinformation, hate speech and violence-inciting content on the platform.”</p><p>Facebook has taken these steps in the past. Notably, it applied these <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-prepares-potentially-chaotic-election-aftermath-172523590.html">“break glass” measures</a> in the days after the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-slow-down-sharing-election-misinformation-003823933.html">presidential election</a>, though the company rolled some of them back the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-election-news-feed-algorithm-reversal-publishers-160308027.html">following month</a>. The company implemented similar changes again, less than a month later, in the aftermath of the insurrection January 6th.</p><p>Huagen said that Facebook has mischaracterized these changes as being harmful to free speech, when in fact the company is concerned because it “wanted that growth back.” During the hearing, she said that Mark Zuckerberg had been personally briefed on just how impactful changes like this could be. But, she said, he prioritized the platform’s growth “over changes that would have significantly decreased misinformation and other inciting content.”</p><h2>Open Facebook’s research to people outside the company</h2><p>Access to Facebook’s data has become a hot button issue in recent weeks as researchers outside the company have complained that the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-data-transparency-researchers-170021370.html">is stifling</a> independent research. Haugen said the social network should work toward making its own internal research available to the public.</p><p>She proposed that there should be a set period of time — she suggested as long as 18 months — when Facebook is able to keep its research under wraps. But then the company should make it accessible to those outside the company.</p><p>“I believe in collaboration with academics and other researchers that we can develop privacy-conscious ways of exposing radically more data that is available today,” Haugen said. “It is important for our ability to understand how algorithms work, how Facebook shapes the information, we get to see that we have these data sets to be publicly available for scrutiny.”</p><p>She went on to say that Facebook&#39;s researchers are among its “biggest heroes” because “they are boldly asking real questions and willing to say awkward truths.” She said it was “unacceptable” that the company has been “throwing them under the bus” in its effort <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-mental-health-senate-hearing-210317155.html">to downplay</a> her disclosures.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2f0598c0-265e-11ec-bfdf-5666e73b4bde" alt="Zuckerberg took weeks to weigh in on the whistleblower&#39;s disclosures, except for a comment about his electric surfboard." data-uuid="977234f9-57f3-31c8-b62a-95927722f358"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><h2>A dedicated ‘oversight body’</h2><p>Besides internal changes, Haugen also said that there should be a dedicated “oversight body” with the power to oversee social media platforms. She said that such a group within an agency like the Federal Trade Commission could provide “a regulatory home where someone like me could do a tour of duty after working at a place like this.”</p><p>“Right now, the only people in the world who are trained to analyze these experiments, to understand what&#39;s happening inside of Facebook, are people who grew up inside of Facebook or Pinterest or another social media company,” she said.</p><p>Importantly, this “oversight body” would be separate from the Facebook-created <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oversight%20board">Oversight Board</a>, which advises Facebook on specific content decisions. While Facebook has said the creation of the Oversight Board is proof it’s trying to self-regulate, Haugen wrote in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-s-senate-testimony/8d324185-d725-4d99-9160-9ce9e13f58a3/">prepared remarks</a> that the Oversight Board “is as blind as the public” when it comes to truly knowing what happens inside of the company.</p><p>It’s also worth noting that Haugen said she was opposed to efforts to break up Facebook. She said that separating Facebook and Instagram would likely result in more advertisers flocking to Instagram, which could deplete Facebook’s resources for making changes to improve its platform.</p><h2>What’s next</h2><p>While it’s unclear which, if any, of Haugen’s recommendations Congress will act on, her disclosures have already caught the attention of regulators. In addition to providing documents to Congress, she has also given documents to the <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-sec-complaint-60-minutes-2021-10-04/">Securities and Exchange Committee</a>. She has alleged that Zuckerberg and other executives have “misled investors and the public about its role perpetuating misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and January 6th insurrection,&quot; according to SEC filings published by <em>60 Minutes.</em></p><p>Meanwhile, Facebook has continued to push back on Haugen’s claims. A week after an executive told lawmakers that “this is not bombshell research,” the company tried to discredit Haugen more directly. In a statement, Facebook’s Director of Policy Communications Lena Pietsch, said Haugen “worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives. We don’t agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about.” Pietsch added that “it’s time to begin to create standard rules for the internet.”</p><p>In an appearance <a href="https://twitter.com/donie/status/1445474828329181188">on CNN</a> following the hearing, Facebook VP Monika Bickert referred to Haugen’s disclosures as “stolen documents” and said the company’s research had been “mischaracterized.” Later that night, Zuckerberg publicly weighed in for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mark-zuckerberg-denies-facebook-profit-over-safety-033717690.html">first time</a> since <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> began publishing stories based on Haugen&#39;s disclosures (Zuckerberg did once <a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113917270874401">refer </a>to earlier coverage of the scandals, complaining that a news article has mistakenly described his hydrofoil as an &quot;electric surfboard.&quot;) In his first substantive statement, he said &quot;many of the claims don&#39;t make any sense,&quot; and that &quot;the argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>It could still get more difficult for Facebook to counter Haugen, though, particularly if new documents become public. Her letter to the SEC suggests that Facebook knew much more about QAnon and violent extremism on its platform than it let on, as <em>Vice</em><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wx5v4y/facebooks-algorithm-spread-qanon-content-to-new-users">reported earlier</a>. Haugen may also make appearances in front of lawmakers in other countries, too.  European lawmakers, many of whom have expressed similar concerns as their US counterparts, have <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/facebook-faces-wrath-of-eu-lawmakers-working-on-online-content-rules/">also indicated</a> they want to talk to Haugen and conduct <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/european-politicians-call-facebook-investigation-after-whistleblower-revelation-2021-10-04/">new investigations</a> of their own.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6fa48470-6cee-4103-bf14-7ac06e11168f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:30:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633547499</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T19:11:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c7435030-25f7-11ec-8ffe-eed4478fd616" width="6432" height="4288" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c7435030-25f7-11ec-8ffe-eed4478fd616" width="6432" height="4288" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[POOL New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Former Facebook employee and whistleblower Frances Haugen testifies during a Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing entitled 'Protecting Kids Online: Testimony from a Facebook Whistleblower' on Capitol Hill, in Washington, U.S., October 5, 2021.

It has wide, non-pneumatic tires plus a dual suspension system that works to stabilize both the front and back wheel. You&#39;re also getting a double-braking system outfitted with both a mechanical and electrical brake that lets you stop within 13 inches at 12.4 mph. When riding at nighttime, you can turn on the front-facing LED for better visibility, too. We also appreciate that the ES4 is fairly portable — it&#39;s hefty at 31 pounds, but it folds down neatly so you can stow it in a trunk or take it on public transportation.</p><p>And like most gadgets today, the ES4 connects to Segway&#39;s mobile app and that lets you do things like lock and unlock the scooter, activate cruise control, install firmware updates and check out riding stats. While a scooter like this probably won&#39;t replace all other forms of transportation, it&#39;s a convenient way to get from one place to another — especially for those living in big cities or dense suburbs.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/segways-ninebot-es4-scooter-is-260-off-today-only-at-amazon-141002029.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3974b5e7-c8ef-4a50-82b3-e99f5d4a1b7d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:10:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633528825</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T14:00:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/d2d07040-25c6-11eb-99b7-d313539423e7" width="1602" height="949" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/d2d07040-25c6-11eb-99b7-d313539423e7" width="1602" height="949" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SEGWAY]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NINEBOT KICKSCOOTER ES4 electric scooter]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SEGWAY NINEBOT KICKSCOOTER ES4]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTags are cheaper than usual when you buy four]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now might be a good time to buy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">Apple&#39;s AirTags</a> if you need more than one or two.

Just remember that Woot&#39;s <a href="https://www.woot.com/faq?ref=w_ngf_rp&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=CJ&amp;cjevent=5d43949526aa11ec82c067e90a82b836&amp;utm_source=Skimlinks#what-is-woots-return-policy">return policy</a> is stricter than Amazon&#39;s.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/2WOY5WA" id="d9fa3b1eb58a4b5b93e5492439ac1925" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Woot;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Apple AirTag">Buy Apple AirTag (four-pack) on Woot - $95</a><p>AirTags are only useful in the Apple ecosystem, but promise a few advantages over trackers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-tile-mate-pro-replaceable-batteries.html">from Tile</a> and other rivals. On top of fast setup, ultra-wideband support offers precision finding (with iPhone 11 and newer) when you&#39;re close — you&#39;ll know just which couch cushion is hiding your keys. You&#39;ll also have an item-locating network that spans virtually all Apple device users, increasing the chances of finding a missing bag or wallet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are catches, of course. Android users need not apply, and the lack of a hole means you&#39;ll be buying an accessory to clip the AirTag to a keychain or backpack. The year-long battery life will also require that you keep a load of watch batteries on hand. If you don&#39;t see yourself leaving the Apple ecosystem any time soon, though, AirTags are a reasonably safe bet.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-four-pack-sale-140051531.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c090d98f-443e-4569-93ea-41361c011e04</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 06 Oct 2021 14:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633528963</ingested><modified>2021-10-06T14:02:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/a537c320-b105-11eb-beff-823d37e1f6ff" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/a537c320-b105-11eb-beff-823d37e1f6ff" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirTags on a keychain]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirTags on a keychain]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
