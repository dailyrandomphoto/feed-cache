By &quot;smartwatches,&quot; though, we really just mean the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">Galaxy Watch 4</a> and Watch 4 Classic — the app, first spotted by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/galaxy-watch-4-walkie-talkie/"><em>XDA-Developers</em></a>, only works with the tech giant&#39;s latest wearables and isn&#39;t compatible with any of their predecessors.&nbsp;</p><p>That would limit the number of friends you can chat with, since they also need to own the latest Galaxy Watch. That said, the app&#39;s Google Play description says &quot;two or more users&quot; can have instant conversations, so you may be able to use the app outside of secret one-on-one chats in the middle of the night. Provided you know other people who have a Watch 4, of course, unless Samsung decides to roll the app out for its previous wearable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To be able to use the feature, you need to log into your Samsung account on a phone connected to your watch. Samsung also recommends using and running the app for the first time while that watch is connected to a smartphone. After that, you&#39;ll be able to create channels for your conversation, connect to a nearby friend&#39;s watch and talk by pressing a big mic button at the center of the screen. You&#39;ll also be able to toggle the feature off any time you&#39;re feeling anti-social.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-walkie-talkie-app-105357170.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7398856c-232a-4a6f-9682-8324be0ab8f0</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 10:53:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630407262</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T10:54:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/94c01440-0a45-11ec-bf7f-f4d030f1fd22" width="1600" height="960" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/94c01440-0a45-11ec-bf7f-f4d030f1fd22" width="1600" height="960" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's rumored iPhone satellite support may be for emergency calls and messages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The rumored satellite features for future iPhones are reserved for emergency uses only, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-30/apple-plans-to-add-satellite-features-to-iphones-for-emergencies"><em>Bloomberg&#39;s</em></a> Mark Gurman. A few days ago, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-leo-satellite-communication-165409961.html">report</a> by well-known analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said the next iPhones will come with support for Low Earth Orbit satellite calls and messages. Gurman&#39;s sources said, however, that Apple isn&#39;t turning its devices into actual satellite phones, at least for now. Instead, the tech giant is reportedly developing at least two emergency-related features relying on satellite networks.&nbsp;</p><p>The first feature is called Emergency Message via Satellite and will be added as a third protocol, alongside iMessage and SMS, to the Messages app. It&#39;s apparently codenamed Stewie inside the company and will allow users to text emergency services even when there&#39;s no signal, which sounds especially useful during emergencies in remote locations, such as mountains and forests.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tool will also give users a way to text their emergency contacts simply by typing Emergency SOS in the recipient line. Messages will be restricted to a shorter length, but the senders&#39; contacts will get a notification for them even if their phone is set to Do Not Disturb. Satellite messages will appear as gray bubbles instead of blue or green so they can be easily identified. Eventually, the feature could handle phone calls, as well.</p><p>Apple is also reportedly working on a second satellite feature that will allow users to report crisis situations like plane crashes and fires. This system will give users a way to report the incident at length and will ask them specifics, such as if anybody needs search-and-rescue services or if anybody in the vicinity is armed. It can also automatically send authorities the reporter&#39;s location and their details from the Health app, such as their medical history, age, medications and information like height and weight. The feature can also a notify the reporter&#39;s emergency contacts for them.</p><p>While both features sound useful, their availability is restricted by satellite location and reach. They might not work for some regions, and in some cases, users may have to walk outdoors in a certain direction where their iPhone can connect to a satellite. Also, Gurman&#39;s sources said it&#39;s unlikely that the features will be ready before the year ends, which means the next iPhones expected be announced sometime in September won&#39;t be able to send messages via satellite yet.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-rumored-iphone-satellite-support-emergency-calls-messages-092538075.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">32dfc42f-8593-412b-8fc2-4fb0cef23035</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 09:25:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630401962</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T09:26:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/687d08b0-0a32-11ec-b677-cabddceab0d0" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/687d08b0-0a32-11ec-b677-cabddceab0d0" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[oatawa via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bangkok, Thailand - Jan 13, 2021: Close up hand holding black smartphone iPhone 12 Pro Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Close up hand holding black smartphone iPhone 12 Pro Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO Max and YouTube are now available on Spectrum TV]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spectrum TV has made major streaming service additions to its digital cable service and live TV app with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-smart-tv-app-overhaul-173225888.html">HBO Max</a> and YouTube, parent Charter has <a href="https://corporate.charter.com/newsroom/hbo-max-and-youtube-launch-on-spectrum-tv-platform">announced</a>.

As of August 27th, the group called #AppleToo said it has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/appletoo-500-toxic-workplace-issues-170013024.html">collected</a> 500 such stories — now, it has started publishing them on its <a href="https://medium.com/appletoo/appletoo-digest-1-39e489d8726b">official Medium page</a>. Cher Scarlett, an Apple security engineer and the face of the movement, wrote on Medium that she will share five stories at a time &quot;as the emotional toll in reading these is heavy.&quot;</p><p>Two of the first five are about sexual harassment, one of which involved a male boss using his position of power over a female employee. Later, that employee was kicked out of an interview after the hiring team realized who she was. Another story was from a Black retail worker in the UK who tried to get their bosses to do something about racism and micro aggressions in the workplace to no avail. A female employee talked about how she was targeted by a person in her team and how management didn&#39;t do anything about it. And the last one is about an employee who was assaulted in her store by a customer and didn&#39;t get support from management.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If Scarlett publishes all the submissions she got, these are just five of the many we&#39;ll get to read. The #AppleToo movement said on Twitter, however, that 75 percent share a common theme: They involve some form of discrimination. Nearly half of them involve sexism, retaliation and HR reports that were ultimately dismissed. A fourth of them involved racism and ableism, and most of the harassment and assault stories were sexual in nature.&nbsp;</p><div id="b012abdce3c249539176120f7d03aae3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">75% of the stories we&#39;ve received involved some form of discrimination, and nearly half involved reports of sexism, retaliation, and HR reports that were dismissed. 1/4 involved racism or ableism.

If we’re going to have any chance of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ipcc-2021-climate-change-report-182200028.html">addressing climate change</a>, we’ll need to move away from burning fossil fuels in our cars. There’s just one problem with most electric vehicles: they depend on lithium-ion batteries made with heavy metals like cobalt. Not only is the material in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-19-earthworks-renewable-energy-metal-demand.html">short supply</a>, but it’s mined in a way that involves <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-19-apple-samsung-sony-amnesty-child-labor-drc.html">child labor</a> and the <a href="https://unctad.org/news/developing-countries-pay-environmental-cost-electric-car-batteries">destruction</a> of the environment. For those reasons, companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-ibm-research-ev-battery-cobalt-free.html">IBM</a>, Panasonic and Tesla have tried to make electric batteries without heavy metals.</p><p>So far, many of those efforts have yet to make it out of the lab, but a Chinese company called <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/svolt-unveils-worlds-first-series-production-cobalt-free-battery-to-be-assembled-in-vehicles-at-chengdu-motor-show-2021-301365031.html">SVOLT</a> claims it’s ready to start producing a cobalt-free battery at scale. At the Chengdu Motor Show, the firm showed off an 82.5KWh capacity power pack inside a vehicle from Chinese automaker Great Wall Motors. Under normal temperatures, SVOLT says its battery can deliver approximately 373 miles of range on a single charge and allow a car to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in under five seconds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>SVOLT said the battery is “expected” to make its way to cars that go on sale in the Chinese market but didn’t offer a timeline of when that might happen, nor did it say just how many cobalt-free power packs it can manufacture at the moment.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul called it an “unprecedented system breakdown” of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mta">Metropolitan Transportation Authority</a>.</p><p>The <em>Washington Post</em> reports that the problems began when a power line went down. This triggered a voltage dip across the city, and two power plants and generators also went offline, forcing backup systems to come online. When trying to restore service, a power surge occurred. When this happened, the subway command center lost communications with 83 trains. The public address system also went down. Five trains with more than 550 people were stranded.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Part of the problem was the passengers themselves. While emergency personnel did evacuate as many people as they could, riders on two trains decided to leave cars on their own, a very dangerous act because tracks could be re-energized if a train was coming. Firefighters had to search the tracks to make sure there were no more remaining passengers before the subway could fully restore power.</p><p>After a phased “rolling restoration,” the system was finally back online at 1:30AM Monday morning.</p><p>Hochul has since ordered a deeper investigation into what exactly caused the surge as well as the other problems. So far, investigators have said there is no suspicion of terrorism or malicious actions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nyc-subway-mta-power-surge-194516628.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d6dcd567-6f01-4f22-801f-4a9fbe4d7ebe</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 19:45:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630380769</ingested><modified>2021-08-31T03:33:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5b24f2a0-09c8-11ec-8f4f-48223bfd26de" width="6848" height="4488" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5b24f2a0-09c8-11ec-8f4f-48223bfd26de" width="6848" height="4488" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gary Hershorn via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 2: A G train arrives at the Smith - 9th Street station in Brooklyn on August 2, 2021 in New York City.

But people who previously signed up may not have shared the information.</p><p>But over the “next few weeks” Instagram will begin prompting users who haven’t previously shared a birthdate to do so.

First, the app will show a notification “a handful of times.” A separate prompt may also appear if users try to view a post that’s hidden behind a warning screen. These warnings appear on <a href="https://help.instagram.com/251027992727268">“sensitive content”</a> that might not break Instagram’s official rules, but could be considered borderline, such as “suggestive” images or photos of medical procedures.

It&#39;s leaps and bounds better as a music player than the Nest Mini or the Echo Dot, and it sounds even better if you have two Nest Audios playing in stereo mode. It even has Media EQ, which adapts the audio to better fit what you&#39;re listening to (like music vs. podcasts), and Ambient QI, which changes the Assistant&#39;s output so you can hear it better in louder environments.</p><p>And as with other assistant-toting devices, you&#39;ll be able to call upon the Google Assistant when you have a question that needs answering, when you want to know what the weather will be like tomorrow, when you want to turn on your smart lights and more.

Earlier this month, Tencent was forced to cut <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tencent-limits-honor-of-kings-play-time-122045915.html">the amount of time minors could play</a> the smash hit mobile title <em>Honor of Kings</em> to just an hour on weeknights and two hours on the weekend. The added restriction is likely to impact the share price of companies in this space, which has seen recent instability.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Historically, China has always had an aversion to video games, albeit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-01-30-china-console-ban.html">with more nuance than most people believe.</a> The country has, however, amplified anti-game rhetoric in recent years, and on August 3rd, a key state-owned news outlet described video games as “spiritual opium.” The piece, as reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/technology/china-video-game-tencent.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, went on to outline all of the ways in which gaming could harm Chinese kids.</p><p>As well as the time limit for online gaming (and we’ve asked our colleagues to clarify if any of this can also apply to offline and console gaming), authorities want all titles hooked up to some form of anti-addiction system.

In addition, the new watches will offer continuous heart-rate tracking, a new blood oxygenation sensor and a new built-in wellness app for more reliable activity tracking.

The new watches will launch in two sizes: a 42mm case with three color options, while you can get four different paint jobs if you opt for the 44mm case. Both devices, however, have a 1.28-inch round AMOLED display (326 ppi), with 8GB of built-in storage and 1GB of RAM.

You might have struggled to get a PS5, though anecdotal evidence suggests a lot of us have been able to find consoles as stores stock up, but that hasn’t stopped Sony sneaking out a <em>slightly </em>new model. According to a teardown of the digital (no disc-drive) PlayStation 5 by Austin Evans, there seems to be a<a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-revision-smaller-heatsink-142922979.html"> smaller, lighter heatsink</a> and a new screw to attach the console to its stand.</p><p>So no, this isn’t like the smaller PlayStation consoles the company likes to roll out during a console’s midlife — it’s way too early for that. It does show that the company is looking for ways to shave production costs and get these consoles into profitability.</p><p>Interestingly, Sony already stated it’s selling the disc-based PS5 at a profit. Games consoles typically sell at a loss for the first couple of years after launch. Hopefully, that smaller heatsink will still handle the bigger, more lavish titles on their way to the PS5.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review</a></h2><h3>Doing the most and yet not enough</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/897c7a90-074f-11ec-b775-b068887a84ef" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 on a table with an S Pen Pro in front of it." data-uuid="6686c526-24dd-3a04-884d-ab02c7c33fe5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure></a><h3></h3><p>The Z Fold 3 is an impressively refined foldable, with water-resistant hardware that feels sturdier than before.

With the 4K Xbox Series X displaying eight times the number of pixels, however, anyone still using the ancient gamerpics will get a hilariously tiny view of their avatar.&nbsp;</p><p>Video producer and editor Gabriel Roland (@Noukon) was complaining about that very issue on Twitter. &quot;I bought this gamerpic for 80 Xbox Points in 2006,&quot; he<a href="https://twitter.com/noukon/status/1428469278068539394"></a>tweeted. &quot;And I’ll be fucked if it won’t remain the best dollar I’ve ever spent.&quot; An accompanying image shows his beloved, barely visible avatar floating in a massive circle of grey.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3e4ffa7175ed4b5099010b81ef4766fd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">With each passing generation, Xbox tries to shame my Pac-Man ghost avatar by shrinking it ever smaller and smaller.

Amazingly, she found that the same gamerpic Noukon purchased was still on sale, albeit at nearly two and half times the price, but she gladly splurged the $2.38 to buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>Right off the bat, Marie noticed that Xbox 360 gamerpics display differently if you&#39;re looking at your own profile or someone else&#39;s. On your own, the avatar is displayed as above and looks truly wonky. On someone else&#39;s profile, it displays better against your background, but it&#39;s still tiny and the edges are cut off by the circular format of newer gamerpics.&nbsp;</p><div id="827f64da19dd4c7cbb7fb3b3a1d9d906"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Before we even think about what looks good, we need to look at the inconsistency in the profile page/editor that started this thread. 360 gamerpics look fundamentally different here depending on whether you&#39;re looking at your own profile (broken) or someone else&#39;s (intended). <a href="https://t.co/m5o0sXHfMx">pic.twitter.com/m5o0sXHfMx</a></p>— Eden Marie (@neonepiphany) <a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1430771417298083848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The grey border issue turned out to be a bug introduced at some point, so Marie was able to fix that first.  Then, she took advantage of the Xbox UI&#39;s ability to handle transparency in images by overlaying the square gamerpic into a transparent circular image. After upsizing everything to a reasonable size, the avatar looks great and the problem has been solved. &quot;What do you think, <a href="https://twitter.com/noukon">@noukon</a>?

Marie noted that the fix will be introduced for all Xbox users still rocking those old gamerpics. &quot;PS, since there have been questions, this will need to roll out with other console updates, Insiders first, and this will change how all 360 gamerpics show up on console, not just certain ones,&quot; she noted. The fix has now been added to the Alpha ring, so if all goes well, it should fix everybody&#39;s messed up Xbox 360 gamerpics in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/your-tiny-xbox-360-gamerpic-may-finally-display-properly-on-modern-consoles-103031164.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e2f4381d-912a-4272-bedd-da8db718569e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 10:30:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630311177</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T08:13:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5a4f580-0960-11ec-afda-2a58abd767b5" width="1425" height="912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5a4f580-0960-11ec-afda-2a58abd767b5" width="1425" height="912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eden Marie]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Your tiny Xbox 360 gamerpic may finally display properly on modern consoles]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Your tiny Xbox 360 gamerpic may finally display properly on modern consoles]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[VW customers will soon have a choice for in-car 4G connectivity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Volkswagen has <a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1590">unveiled</a> a new feature for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-12-volkswagen-siri-shortcuts-car-net.html">Car-Net</a> connected vehicle service that lets you get 4G data from two major US telecoms.

Car-Net comes standard on most 2020 model year and newer Volkswagen vehicles. .</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vw-customers-will-soon-have-a-choice-for-in-car-4-g-connectivity-065509127.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a69c75a9-0fc5-461a-a854-97a70c7c519a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 06:55:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630303999</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T06:13:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/10e9bfa0-0954-11ec-bef7-eaaf49df876d" width="4032" height="2440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/10e9bfa0-0954-11ec-bef7-eaaf49df876d" width="4032" height="2440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[VW customers will soon have a choice for in-car 4G connectivity]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[VW customers will soon have a choice for in-car 4G connectivity]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5a teardown shows that it's still a challenge to repair]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google&#39;s Pixel 5a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5a-ad-headphone-jack-jony-ive-191812803.html">famously</a> has a headphone jack, but you&#39;d better hope that the USB-C port never breaks. The fact that it&#39;s soldered directly to the motherboard rather than being a separate component is one contributing factor in its middling 5/10 repairability score, according to a new teardown from YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8uaCrGkca8"><em>PBKreviews</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The Pixel 5a is Google&#39;s midrange 5G smartphone and a direct successor to the popular 5G <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-samples-specs-price-150053038.html">Pixel 4a</a>. Though a bit larger than the latter and now water-resistant, it&#39;s equipped with nearly the same internal components, including a Snapdragon 765G, 6GB of RAM and a 60Hz panel. It&#39;s a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">solid</a> mid-range phone for $449, though essentially a stopgap device until Google unveils the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">Pixel 6</a> family that will use its all-new Tensor mobile chip.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="03b8867a857048189a3d77b19c222352"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8uaCrGkca8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The good news is that the 6.34-inch OLED display is relatively easy to replace, as you can pull it off simply by heating it up and using a pry tool to pop it off. It&#39;s also fairly straightforward to get access to the battery and motherboard, once you remove the numerous screws and pry off the large metal cover.</p><p>From there, however, things get trickier. The battery is glued solidly to the case and the pry tab meant to help remove it is &quot;pretty useless,&quot; according to <em>PBKreviews.</em> Instead, they had to use isopropyl alcohol to loosen the glue before they could pry the battery out. The other issue is that the USB-C port is attached directly to the motherboard, so making repairs to it would be &quot;difficult,&quot; according to the video.&nbsp;</p><p>All told, however, the Pixel 5a appears to be slightly easier to repair than its predecessor. While you might not try to fix it yourself, that means it could be a bit easier to find local service if you&#39;d rather not send it away to Google. The teardown also shows a solid-looking device with water resistance as a big new benefit — so hopefully, all that will add up to a reliable device that won&#39;t need repairs in the first place.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-teardown-shows-that-its-still-a-challenge-to-repair-051041017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb1a6546-5228-4d10-9683-47de1876a9f4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 05:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630300240</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T05:10:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d2ac9b80-094a-11ec-bfe5-411c73857c0f" width="2048" height="1153" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d2ac9b80-094a-11ec-bfe5-411c73857c0f" width="2048" height="1153" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5a teardown shows that it's still a pain to repair]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5a teardown shows that it's still a pain to repair]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 will reportedly offer larger cases and screens]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a> might be a more substantial redesign than you think. <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claims Series 7 will come in larger 41mm and 45mm case sizes (up from 40mm and 44mm) with bigger screens to match. As with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-27-apple-watch-series-4-review.html">Series 4</a> launch, there will reportedly be new watch faces to take advantage of the added visual real estate.
