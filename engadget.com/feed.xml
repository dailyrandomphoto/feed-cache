First, they didn’t give us instantaneous samples as required by sampling. Film frames are fat. They have duration. The camera shutter is open for a short exposure time. A moving object moves during that short interval, and so smears slightly across the frame during the film exposure time. It’s like what happens when you try to take a long-exposure still photo of your child throwing a ball and his arm is just a blur. This turns out to be a saving grace of cinema as it was actually practiced.</p><p>Second, they made it so each frame is projected twice (at least) by the projector. Ouch! That’s not sampling at all. Why did the inventors do that? Simple economics demanded it: 24 frames per second costs half as much film as 48 frames per second. But the eye needs to be refreshed about 50 times per second, or the retinal image fades between frames. Actually, 48 is close enough to 50 to work in a dark theater. How do you get 48 from 24? You show each frame twice! If you show just 24 frames per second, the screen appears to flicker. Hence the “flicks” from the early days of cinema before higher frame rates were adopted.</p><p>The third thing the original inventors did was to shut off the light between projected frames. This meant that 48 times per second, nothing (blackness) was projected into the eye — inside the pupil, onto the retina. It’s convenient for movie machines — both the camera and projector part — to “shutter” to blackness like this between frames. It allows time for the mechanical advancement of the next film frame into position. In a camera, it keeps the film from recording the real world during the physical advancement of the film. In a projector, it keeps the moving film out of eyesight as it’s physically advanced.</p><p>When you ask how a movie projector works, some people say something like this: There’s a top reel of film which is the source of film, and a bottom take-up reel. The film moves from reel to reel and passes between the light source of the projector and its lens, which magnifies the frame-size image up to screen size. In other words, the film moves continuously past the light source. But that doesn’t work. The eye sees exactly what’s there, and with this scheme the eye would see one frame sliding away as the next frame slides in from the opposite side. It would see the sliding. And that won’t work.</p><p>What a projector actually does is exactly this: It brings each frame into fixed position with the light source blocked. That’s the function of the shutter. Then the shutter opens and the illuminated frame projects onto the screen. Then the shutter closes. Then it opens again, and the illuminated frame is projected a second time onto the screen. Then the shutter closes and the next frame slides into position, and so forth.</p><p>We’ve just described the discrete, or intermittent, movement of film through a projector, as opposed to unworkable continuous movement. The same idea holds for a camera. The physical device that implements this action is called, in fact, an <em>intermittent movement</em>. This is the key notion in cinema history that is comparable to the conditional branch instruction in computer history. The mad rush to the movie machine turned on who first got a projector to work correctly, and that hinged on who got an intermittent movement working properly. It’s a defining notion.</p><p>To recap: An actual film-based movie projector doesn’t reconstruct a continuous visual flow from the frame samples and present this to the eye. Instead, it sends “fat samples” — thick with time duration and smeared motion — directly to the eye’s retina. It sends each frame twice, and it sends blackness between. It’s up to the brain to reconstruct motion from these inputs. How does that work?</p><p>Somehow the eye-brain system “reconstructs the visual flow” that’s represented by the fat visual samples it receives. Of course, it really does no such thing. Light intensities come in through the pupil as input. But the output from the eye to the brain, through the optic nerve, is an electrochemical pulse train. Neuronal pulse trains aren’t visual flows. It could be that the retina actually does reconstruct a visual flow and then converts it to pulse trains for brain consumption. The responses of some of the neurons in the eye certainly suggest the spreader function, complete with a high positive hump and negative lobes. But brain activity is beyond the scope of this book. Let’s concentrate instead on the customary explanations of the perception of motion from sequences of still snapshots.</p><p><strong>Perception of Motion</strong></p><p>The classic explanation is hoary old <em>persistence of vision</em>. It’s a real characteristic of human vision: once an image stimulus to the retina ceases, we continue to perceive the image there for a short while. But persistence of vision explains only why you don’t see the blackness between frames in the case of film-based movies. If an actor or an animated character moves to a new position between frames then — by persistence of vision — you should see him in both positions: two Humphrey Bogarts, two Buzz Lightyears. In fact, your retinas do see both, one fading out as the other comes in—each frame is projected long enough to ensure this. That’s persistence of vision. But it doesn’t explain why you perceive one moving object, not two objects at different positions. What your brain does with the information from the retinas determines whether you perceive two Bogarts in two different positions or one Bogart moving between them.</p><p>Psychophysicists have performed experiments to determine the characteristics of another real brain phenomenon, called <em>apparent motion</em>. The experiments don’t explain how the brain perceives motion, but they do describe the limitations of the phenomenon. A small white dot on a black background is presented to a subject’s retina. Then that dot is removed, and another dot is presented in a different position. The experimenters can vary two things, the spatial separation of the two dots and the time delay between position change. The brain perceives one dot here and another dot there, but only if the distance and delays are long enough. If the distance and delays are short, the brain perceives that the dot moves from one position to the other. It’s <em>apparent </em>motion because no actual motion is presented to the eye. The brain perceives what it doesn’t see.</p><p><strong>Motion Blur</strong></p><p>Persistence of vision is such that we still perceive the first image when the second one arrives. That sounds a lot like frame spreading. A frame of short duration spreads out in time and adds to the next frame also spread out in time. It’s as if the retina does the image spreading and the adding of successive spread frames. Something like this must be going on because we perceive a continuous visual field although the film projector doesn’t present one. You can think of the shape of the persistence function of the eye as the shape of the frame spreader that’s built into us human perceivers. Another reason we can assume that the eye-brain system must be doing a reconstruction, one that implicitly uses the Sampling Theorem, is because we perceive exactly the errors we would expect if that were the actual mechanism—such as wagon wheels spinning backward.</p><p>Classic cel animation — of the old ink-on-celluloid variety — relies on the apparent-motion phenomenon. The old animators knew intuitively how to keep the successive frames of a movement inside its “not too far, not too slow” boundaries. If they needed to exceed those limits, they had tricks to help us perceive the motion. They drew actual speed lines, which showed the brain the direction of motion and implied that it was fast, like a blur. Or they provided a <em>POOF </em>of dust to mark the rapid descent of Wile E. Coyote as he stepped unexpectedly off a mesa in hot pursuit of that truly wily Road Runner. They provided a visual language that the brain could interpret.</p><p>Exceed the apparent motion limits — without those animators’ tricks — and the results are ugly. You may have seen old school stop-motion animations — such as Ray Harryhausen’s classic sword-fighting skeletons in <em>Jason and the Argonauts </em>(1963) — that are plagued by an unpleasant jerking motion of the characters. You’re seeing double, at least — several edges of a skeleton at the same time — and correctly interpret it as motion, but painfully so. The edges stutter, or “judder,” or “strobe” across the screen. Those words reflect the pain inflicted by staccato motion.</p><p>Live-action movies are sequences of discrete frames just like animations. Why don’t these movies stutter? (Imagine directing Uma Thurman to stay within “not too far, not too slow” limits.) There’s a general explanation that works. It’s called <em>motion blur</em>, and it’s simple and pretty. A frame that’s recorded by a real movie camera is fat with duration. It’s not a sample at a single instant like a Road Runner or a Harryhausen frame. Motion blur is what you see in a still photograph when the subject moves and the shutter isn’t fast enough to stop the motion. In still photographs, it’s often an unintended result, but it turns out to be a feature in movies. Without the blur all movies would look as jerky as Harryhausen’s skeletons—unless Uma miraculously stayed within limits. The motion blur of moving objects in a fat frame gives clues to the brain about what is moving and what is not. The direction of a blur gives the direction of motion, and its length indicates the speed. Somehow, mysteriously, the brain converts that spatial information — the blurs — into temporal information and then perceives motion with the help of the apparent motion phenomenon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-biography-of-the-pixel-alvy-ray-smith-mit-press-153048574.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e8e704fe-1ee4-4627-afef-0e3a940d8800</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2021 15:30:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628093057</ingested><modified>2021-08-04T16:04:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/788a2840-f485-11eb-bfe9-2029a9502d00" width="1200" height="675" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/788a2840-f485-11eb-bfe9-2029a9502d00" width="1200" height="675" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony Music Entertainment]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Michael Jackson eating popcorn in a movie theater]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Michael Jackson popcorn]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Audi off-road hybrid completes endurance test ahead of Dakar Rally]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Audi is hard at work preparing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/audi-rs-q-e-tron-2022-dakar-rally-163605282.html">RS Q E-Tron</a> for the 2022 Dakar Rally in hopes that it can earn the distinction of being the first electrified vehicle to win the grueling competition.

The drivers admitted that there&#39;s still some fine-tuning to be done, but they were impressed with the vehicle&#39;s performance. Arnau Niubó Bosch, Audi&#39;s development engineer,  explained that the test &quot;was focused on getting in as much driving as possible and detecting weak spots.&quot; For the SUV&#39;s next test in September, Audi will take it into the dunes for the first time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As we previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/audi-rs-q-e-tron-2022-dakar-rally-163605282.html">mentioned</a>, the RS Q E-Tron has an electric drivetrain with two modified Formula E motors. It has an energy converter with a TFSI engine to charge its battery while driving and braking, since one wouldn&#39;t find charging stations in the middle of a rally. That means it&#39;s not a zero-emissions vehicle, though Audi says the converter is energy efficient.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/audi-rs-q-etron-spain-endurance-test-dakar-rally-132958988.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b4e6bee-efa6-4a8d-91da-efe2ea4203ec</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 07 Aug 2021 13:29:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628343001</ingested><modified>2021-08-07T13:30:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f8909750-f772-11eb-bf97-48f395052cdf" width="1600" height="1012" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f8909750-f772-11eb-bf97-48f395052cdf" width="1600" height="1012" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Audi Communications Motorsport]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Audi RS Q e-tron]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dakar Test Zaragoza]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook restores policy it 'lost' three years ago]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, Facebook’s Oversight Board chastised the company for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-lost-rule-193222133.html">losing an important policy</a> for three years. At the center of the ruling was an Instagram post about Abdullah Öcalan, which encouraged people to talk about his political imprisonment. Öcalan is one of the founding members of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party. The PKK is a Kurdish militia Facebook classifies as a “dangerous organization.”</p><p>The company had initially removed the post because of a rule that prohibits Facebook users from expressing support for groups and individuals that fall under that category. At the same time, Facebook also had “internal guidance” in place — which came out in part around discussions the company had about Öcalan’s imprisonment — that carved out an exception to that policy to allow people to discuss “conditions of confinement for individuals designated as dangerous.” However, Facebook did not apply that rule to Öcalan’s case due to an oversight that occurred when it moved to a new review system in 2018.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In examining what happened, the Oversight Board issued 12 recommendations to Facebook, which the company <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/oversight/oversight-board-cases/support-of-abdullah-ocalan-founder-of-the-pkk/">responded to today</a>. To start, it will “immediately” re-implement the misplaced policy at the center of the case. Facebook says it has begun training its content reviewers on implementing the rule and expects the guidance to be fully in place within the next two weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>By the end of the year, it also plans to clarify the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/dangerous_individuals_organizations">Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy</a>. Out of the 12 recommendations put forward by the Oversight Board, Facebook plans to fully or partially implement most of them. However, one it’s not sure on would involve the company sharing more comprehensive information on its enforcement of those policies. The company says it’s still examining the feasibility of creating a system that provides a country-by-country breakdown of enforcement and error data. It says it will share an update on that work in one of its upcoming quarterly updates.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-responds-oversight-board-lost-rule-215052348.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cd4c8b02-cf4d-4d50-bb30-8bf11ef667c9</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 21:50:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628286773</ingested><modified>2021-08-06T21:53:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d59d1620-f6fe-11eb-9ffb-457fbfad9173" width="5542" height="3352" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d59d1620-f6fe-11eb-9ffb-457fbfad9173" width="5542" height="3352" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 07: Oversight Board logo is seen on a smart phone in Ankara, Turkey on May 07, 2020.

The tool is the result of last year’s <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/3/bill-to-improve-broadband-data-maps-signed-into-law">Broadband DATA Act</a>, which requires the FCC to collect and release robust data comparing different wired, fixed-wireless, satellite and mobile broadband service providers.

Not to mention the rapidly increasing commercial availability of cutting-edge technologies including UAVs and wireless communications. To help the Marine Corps best prepare for these increased complexities and challenges, the Department of Defense tasked DARPA with developing a digital training and operations planning tool. The result is the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2021-06-22">Prototype Resilient Operations Testbed for Expeditionary Urban Scenarios</a> (PROTEUS) system, a real-time strategy simulator for urban-littoral warfare.</p><p>When the PROTEUS program first began in 2017, “there was a big push across DARPA under what we call a sustainment focus area, and that included urban warfare,” Dr. Tim Grayson, director of DARPA’s Strategic Technology Office, told Engadget, looking at how to best support and “sustain” US fighting forces in various combat situations until they can finish their mission.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fdeaa020-f546-11eb-be7f-ae6588edd541" alt="PROTEUS screen" data-uuid="b25a98ab-2a61-3fda-a3a8-41440cce5a97"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DARPA</div></figure><p>The PROTEUS program manager (who has since departed DARPA), Dr. John S Paschkewitz, “came to the realization that the urban environment is really complex, both from a maneuver perspective,” Grayson said, “but also going into the future where there&#39;s all this commercial technology that will involve communications and spectrum stuff, maybe even robotics and things of that nature.”</p><p>Even without the threat of armed UAVs and autonomous killbots, modern urban conflict zones pose a number of challenges including limited lines of sight and dense, pervasive civilian populations. “​​There&#39;s such a wide range of missions that happen in urban environments,” Grayson said. “A lot of it is almost like peacekeeping, stabilization operations. How do we… help the local populace and protect them.” He also notes that the military is often called in to assist with both national emergencies and natural disasters, which pose the same issues albeit without nearly as much shooting.</p><p>“So, if someone like the Marines or some other kind of sustainment military unit had to go conduct operations in a complex urban environment,” he continued, “it&#39;d be a limited footprint. So, [Paschkewitz] started looking at what we refer to as the ‘what do I put in the rucksack problem.’”</p><p>“The urban fight is about delivering precise effects and adapting faster than the adversary in an uncertain, increasingly complex environment,” Paschkewitz said in a DARPA release from June. “For US forces to maintain a distinct advantage in urban coastal combat scenarios, we need agile, flexible task organizations able to create surprise and exploit advantages by combining effects across operational domains.”</p><p>PROTEUS itself is a software program designed to run on a tablet or hardened PDA and allow anyone from a squad leader up to a company commander to monitor and adjust the “composition of battlefield elements — including dismounted forces, vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), manned aircraft and other available assets,” according to <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2017-06-15">the release</a>. “Through PROTEUS, we aim to amplify the initiative and decision-making capabilities of NCOs and junior officers at the platoon and squad level, as well as field-grade officers, commanding expeditionary landing teams, for example, by giving them new tools to compose tailored force packages not just before the mission, but during the mission as it unfolds.”</p><p>But PROTEUS isn’t just for monitoring and redeploying forces, it also serves as a real-time strategy training system to help NCOs and officers test and analyze different capabilities and tactics virtually. “One of the beauties of [PROTEUS] is it&#39;s flexible enough to program with whatever you want,” Grayson said. It allows warfighters to “go explore their own ideas, their own structure concepts, their own tactics. They&#39;re totally free to use it just as an open-ended experimentation, mission rehearsal or even training type of tool.”</p><p>But for its design flexibility, the system’s physics engine closely conforms to the real-world behaviors and tolerances of existing military equipment as well as commercial drones, cellular, satellite and Wi-Fi communications, sensors and even weapons systems. “The simulation environment is sophisticated but doesn&#39;t let them do things that are not physically realizable,” Grayson explained.</p><p>The system also includes a dynamic composition engine called COMPOSER which not only automate the team’s equipment loadout but can also look at a commander’s plan and provide feedback on multiple aspects including “electromagnetic signature risk, assignment of communications assets to specific units and automatic configuration of tactical networks,” according to a DARPA press release.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1862bfa0-f547-11eb-bdff-05c5160c0214" alt="PROTEUS EMSO Wizard" data-uuid="cbf43a29-168d-3b56-8d49-32ad90d7586d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DARPA</div></figure><p>“Without the EMSO and logistics wizards, it’s hard to effectively coordinate and execute multi-domain operations,” Paschkewitz said. “Marines can easily coordinate direct and indirect fires, but coordinating those with spectrum operations while ensuring logistical support without staff is challenging. These tools allow Marines to focus on the art of war, and the automation handles the science of war.”</p><p>Currently, the system is set up for standard Red vs Blue fights between opposing human forces though Grayzon does not expect PROTEUS to be upgraded to the point that humans will be able to compete against the CPU and even less likely that we’ll see CPU vs CPU — given our current computational and processing capabilities. He does note that the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/program/constructive-machine-learning-battles-with-adversary-tactics">Constructive Machine-learning Battles with Adversary Tactics</a> (COMBAT) program, which is still underway at DARPA, is working to develop “models of Red Force brigade behaviors that challenge and adapt to Blue Forces in simulation experiments.”</p><p>“Building a commander’s insight and judgment is driven by the fact that there’s a live opponent,” Paschkewitz said in June. “We built ULTRA [the sandbox module that serves as the basis for the larger system] around that concept from day one. This is not AI versus AI, or human versus AI, rather there is always a Marine against an ADFOR (adversary force), that’s another Marine, typically, forcing the commander to adapt tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and innovate at mission speed.”</p><p>“PROTEUS enables commanders to immerse themselves in a future conflict where they can deploy capabilities against a realistic adversary,” Ryan Reeder, model and simulation director, MCWL Experiment Division, <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2021-06-22">said in a statement</a>. “Commanders can hone their battlefield skills, while also training subordinates on employment techniques, delivering a cohesive unit able to execute in a more effective manner.</p><p>Technically, DARPA’s involvement with the PROTEUS program has come to an end following its transfer to the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab where it is now being used for ADFOR training and developing new TTPs and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_of_operations">CONOPS</a>. “My guess is they will mostly use it for their own purposes, as opposed to continuing to develop it,” Grayson said. “The Warfighting Lab is less focused on technology and more focused on our future force, concepts and what are our new tactics.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/darpa-proteus-program-gamifies-the-art-of-war-162033175.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cfa8de63-ac2a-4c89-bec1-3c19b47a1557</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 16:20:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628269181</ingested><modified>2021-08-06T16:59:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Armed Forces]]></category><category><![CDATA[Military & Defense]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64d64820-f547-11eb-aa7d-0817d6d239d6" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64d64820-f547-11eb-aa7d-0817d6d239d6" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ian Hitchcock via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BOWEN, AUSTRALIA - JULY 22: A U.S Marine is seen as troops disembark from landing craft in the background on July 22, 2019 in Bowen, Australia.

On the surface, it&#39;s a silly rebranding akin to &quot;ATM machine,&quot; but there seems to be some reasonable logic behind the decision.</p><p>&quot;Krafton is actively expanding the PUBG brand through a variety of new experiences set in its universe,&quot; the publisher told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hold-up-pubg-is-called-pubg-battlegrounds-now/"><em><ins>PC Gamer</ins></em></a>. &quot;Rebranding <em>PlayerUnknown&#39;s Battlegrounds</em> to <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds </em>is the first step in us realizing this vision. Additional titles in the franchise will carry the PUBG name, as you see with our upcoming game, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pubg-new-state-jumps-30-years-into-the-future-093749502.html"><em><ins>PUBG: New State</ins></em></a>.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The next game in the series, <em>PUBG: New State</em>, is a mobile title with a futuristic setting. <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, a horror game from the creators of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Dead%20Space"><em><ins>Dead Space</ins></em></a>, is also connected to the franchise. The name hasn&#39;t been weighed down with the <em>PUBG </em>prefix just yet, though.</p><p>Many players have referred to the original game simply as <em>PUBG </em>for years, and with more games in the franchise on the way, it makes sense to differentiate it a bit. The rebranding also takes the game away from the equally baffling former title, especially for folks who don&#39;t know who the devil PlayerUnknown actually is. Brendan &quot;PlayerUnknown&quot; Greene is the man who ushered in the battle royale craze by creating an <em>ARMA 2 </em>mod and then leading development of <em>PUBG. </em>He <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-playerunknown-leaves-pubg.html"><ins>left the game in 2019</ins></a>.</p><p>Still, Krafton could have called the phenomenally successful game literally anything else rather than giving it another awkward name. Simply <em>PUBG </em>or even <em>PUBG: OG </em>or <em>PUBG: Where Are We Dropping? </em>would have been better.</p><p>Meanwhile, <em>PUBG</em>: <em>Battlegrounds </em>(sigh) is going free-to-play for a week to mark the game&#39;s collaboration with K-pop megastars Blackpink. It won&#39;t cost you a dime to play between August 10th and August 16th.</p><p><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/pubg-free-to-play-blackpink"><ins>According to</ins></a> leaker PlayerIGN, Krafton may be using that week to test the waters and &quot;gauge player responses&quot; before potentially making the game free-to-play permanently. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pubg-mobile-tesla-update-145129031.html"><em><ins>PUBG: Mobile</ins></em></a> is free, as are rival battles royale such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/fortnite"><em><ins>Fortnite</ins></em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Apex%20Legends"><em><ins>Apex Legends</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Call%20of%20Duty%3A%20Warzone"><em><ins>Call of Duty: Warzone</ins></em></a>.</p><div id="514f2e59bbc14d88a2617ec197b5151b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Announcing the official collaboration of PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS and <a href="https://twitter.com/BLACKPINK?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@BLACKPINK</a>!

Based on the Pomodoro Technique that divides tasks into timed segments with breaks, the new Clock app mode asks you to choose a task (from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-to-do-update-wunderlist-closure-225333701.html">Microsoft To Do</a>, at least for now), set a timer and choose a Spotify playlist if you need a soundtrack. When the timer is done, your music will stop and let you know it&#39;s time for a brief pause.</p><p>Focus Sessions aren&#39;t yet available in public Insider Previews, but there&#39;s a real chance they&#39;ll be available in the finished version of Windows 11 arriving late this year. Microsoft has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-08-spotify-arrives-on-xbox-one.html">integrated Spotify with Xbox consoles</a> before, but this appears to be the first major effort in Windows.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The concept of a Pomodoro app isn&#39;t new, but this will be built into Windows — and Microsoft is clearly hoping the Spotify tie-in will make a difference.

Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://amzn.to/3fDI5wF">Jabra&#39;s Elite 85h</a> headphones are available for $150 on Amazon once again, giving you another chance to grab them at the price if you weren&#39;t able to last month. We praised the wireless headphones for offering active noise cancellation that rivals the technologies used by Bose and Sony and gave it a score of 84 in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-12-jabra-elite-85h-review.html">review</a>. The device was priced at $300 upon launch in 2019, which we felt was a bit too high for what it can do. Amazon has been selling it for $174 after its sale in July, but now it&#39;s back down to its lowest price on the website.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3fDI5wF">Buy Jabra Elite 85h Wireless Noise-Canceling Headphones at Amazon - $150</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To be clear, only the Titanium Black version is on sale for $150 on Jabra&#39;s official store on Amazon, while the rest will cost you a bit more. If you don&#39;t mind the lack of color options, though, one of the best features we liked about the headphones is their insane battery life that can last up for to 41 hours with noise cancelation turned off. During our tests, we used the Elite 85h for around two to three hours a day for seven days and still had 85 percent of power left by the time we were done.&nbsp;</p><p>We also liked that it has EQ and noise-cancellation presets you can choose from based on your environment. You can have different settings for use in public and in private, and you don&#39;t even have to manually switch between them. The headphones have the ability to analyze noise, so they can detect your location and switch to the appropriate profile.</p><p>In addition, we praised the headphones for having simple controls and a better design than some of their rivals. We noted in our review that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh1000xm3-headphones-deal-114006907.html">Sony&#39;s 1000XM3</a> has better sound quality, but that device will set you back $100 more on Amazon right now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85h-anc-headphones-150-amazon-115755893.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1ee5d5ff-eace-4410-b008-63fb6b043f73</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 06 Aug 2021 11:57:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628251119</ingested><modified>2021-08-06T11:58:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cfa373f0-f6a3-11eb-bde9-787f0a47085d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cfa373f0-f6a3-11eb-bde9-787f0a47085d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85h]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85h]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Disney’s immersive Star Wars experience is really expensive]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Disney&#39;s <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/star-wars-galactic-starcruiser/overview/"><ins>Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser</ins></a> is going to cost you.

With the release of iOS 15, watchOS 8 and macOS Monterey later this year, the company says it will introduce a variety of child safety features across Messages, Photos and Siri.</p><p>To start, the Messages app will include new notifications to warn children, as well as their parents, when they either send or receive sexually explicit photos. When someone sends a child an inappropriate image, the app will blur it and display several warnings. Apple will also introduce new software tools in iOS and iPadOS that will allow the company to detect when someone uploads content to iCloud that shows children involved in sexually explicit acts. Rather than scanning photos when they&#39;re uploaded to the cloud, the system will use an on-device database of &quot;known&quot; images.
