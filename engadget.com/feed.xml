The Marvel series is <a href="https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/disney-debuts-new-trailer-and-poster-for-marvel-studios-moon-knight/">now set</a> to debut March 30th, and the trailer shows just how the streaming service will handle the mercenary turned superhero. Oscar Isaac stars as Steven Grant, a gift shop worker who has trouble distinguishing not just between dreams and waking life, but between identities — he learns he shares a body with the mercenary Marc Spector. The two  identities have to reconcile while grappling with a threat among Egyptian gods, eventually coalescing into the show&#39;s namesake knight.</p><p>The series also stars Ethan Hawke and <em>Ramy</em>&#39;s May Calamawy. Mohamed Diab and the duo of Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead directed the season. <em>The Umbrella Academy</em>&#39;s Jeremy Slater is the lead writer, with Marvel Cinematic Universe guru Kevin Feige serving as one of several executive producers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Moon Knight</em> is one of several MCU &quot;Phase Four&quot; shows <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-disney-plus-ms-marvel-she-hulk-moon-knight.html">announced in 2019</a>, including now-available projects like <em>WandaVision</em> and <em>Hawkeye</em> as well as yet-to-air productions like <em>Ms. Marvel</em> and <em>She Hulk</em>. In some ways, it represents the next wave of Disney+ content. Disney is confident enough to bank less on connections to popular Marvel movies and more on new stories, even if it&#39;s still leaning on stars like Isaac (himself no stranger to Disney) to attract viewers.</p><div id="5287ea8790a54c109bf8810bacf34c64"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x7Krla_UxRg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvel-moon-knight-disney-plus-release-date-trailer-210149240.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">79198e54-c989-4e67-a0f8-31cef4130f70</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 21:01:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642539130</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T20:52:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/842e4960-789c-11ec-a4ef-080645cc406c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/842e4960-789c-11ec-a4ef-080645cc406c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Entertainment/Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Trailer for Marvel's 'Moon Knight' on Disney+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Trailer for Marvel's 'Moon Knight' on Disney+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AT&T and Verizon delay 5G rollout at some airports after airlines warn of disruptions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AT&amp;T and Verizon say they will voluntarily delay the deployment of their new C-Band 5G services near some US airports after several carriers, including Delta, United and Southwest Airlines, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-airlines-warning-letter-211919932.html">wrote to the federal government</a> to warn of potential flight delays due to the rollout.

The Citizen Lab, a research facility based at the University of Toronto&#39;s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, said a &quot;simple but devastating flaw&quot; made it easy to bypass encryption systems that are supposed to protect voice audio and file transfers.</p><p>&quot;The worst case scenario is that someone is intercepting all the traffic and recording all the passport details, all the medical details,&quot; research associate Jeffrey Knockel told <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/china-s-olympic-app-contains-simple-but-devastating-flaw-1.5744221"><em><ins>CTV</ins></em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The app is used for health monitoring as part of COVID-19 countermeasures. Other features include messaging, news about the Games and information about logistics. The International Olympic Committee says the local Beijing 2022 workforce is using the app for things like time-keeping and task management too.</p><p>&quot;The IOC has conducted independent third-party assessments on the application from two cyber-security testing organizations,&quot; the IOC told Engadget in a statement. &quot;These reports confirmed that there are no critical vulnerabilities.&quot; The IOC noted that instead of using the mobile app, attendees can access a web-based health monitoring system. It said it has requested the researchers&#39; report &quot;to understand their concerns better.&quot;</p><p>The Citizen Lab notes that health customs forms containing passport information and travel and medical history are also at risk. In addition, the researchers said it was possible to spoof server responses, which could let hackers provide fake instructions to users.</p><p>Along with determining that the app doesn&#39;t encrypt some data transmissions, the team found that the app fails to validate some SSL certificates. In such cases, the app can&#39;t &quot;validate to whom it is sending sensitive, encrypted data.&quot; Although they were only able to create an account on the iOS app, the researchers believe the vulnerabilities exist on the Android version of MY2022 as well.</p><p>The Citizen Lab said it informed the organizing committee for the Games about the issues on December 3rd, and said it had 15 days to respond and 45 days to fix the issues before it published its findings. As of Tuesday, the researchers hadn&#39;t received a reply.</p><p>An updated iOS version of the app that was released on Sunday didn&#39;t solve the problems. According to the researchers, the developers added a feature called “Green Health Code” that asks for more travel and medical history details, which are also vulnerable to the SSL certification issue.</p><p>According to the researchers, the flaws could mean that the app contravenes Apple&#39;s App Store rules and Google’s Unwanted Software Policy. In addition, MY2022 may be violating China&#39;s privacy standards and laws.</p><p>In addition, The Citizen Lab noted that the app includes an option to report “politically sensitive” content. It has a list of 2,442 censorship keywords too, which is said to be inactive at the minute, but includes terms related to topics like Xinjiang, Tibet, Chinese government agencies and other socially sensitive matters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/olympics-app-my2022-security-privacy-ioc-201935413.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">de2db631-f679-40dc-b87f-40c9a848396e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 20:19:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642537176</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T20:19:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/20162930-789b-11ec-9de7-ce114879684d" width="5216" height="3477" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/20162930-789b-11ec-9de7-ce114879684d" width="5216" height="3477" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carlos Garcia Rawlins / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman walks past the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic logo at an installation featuring National Speed Skating Oval, in Beijing, China January 18, 2022.

Only about 10 percent of them merited action versus 20 to 30 percent for other categories (such as abuse). Some people were prone to merely flagging off-topic tweets as misinformation.

This appears to be a sincere nod to what made the game special, not just an attempt to milk its success and widen its audience.</p><div id="19bbbc79cbc34f8b818efcd6c398e12e"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Sel3fjl6uyo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-the-cuphead-show-release-date-trailer-155529331.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7dfa2f16-d119-4044-8db2-2028dd6e72c5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:55:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642532339</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T18:59:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e28e8a80-7872-11ec-9fff-7f62f971927c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e28e8a80-7872-11ec-9fff-7f62f971927c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Courtesy of Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cuphead and Mugman in 'The Cuphead Show' on Netflix]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cuphead and Mugman in 'The Cuphead Show' on Netflix]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lenovo made a $329 Snapdragon-powered Windows 11 tablet for students]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/lenovo"><ins>Lenovo</ins></a> has revealed its latest batch of devices geared toward students. Perhaps the most eye-catching offering is a Snapdragon 7c-powered Windows 11 tablet. The company suggests the 10w Tablet might be a great fit for younger students, since the device has a rugged design with a rubber bumper and Corning Gorilla Glass on the Full HD, 10.1-inch display. The screen has a 16:10 aspect ratio and 400 nits of brightness. There are 2MP front-facing and 8MP rear-facing cameras too.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/98349330-7872-11ec-b7be-d3beb6bc1708" style="height:1323;width:2000;" alt="Lenovo 10w Tablet" data-uuid="ea2ad24e-bb72-3065-8fee-358a0166cdbb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lenovo</div></figure><p>The tablet comes with a detachable keyboard and there&#39;s an optional pen. The 10w Tablet has a 30Whr battery and comes with up to 8GB of LPDDR4x RAM and up to 128GB of eMMC storage. Unfortunately, there&#39;s only one USB-C port, but there is a headphone jack, which should help students avoid having to fiddle with the Windows Bluetooth settings. The tablet weighs 573g (1.26 lbs) and 1.1kg (2.42 lbs) with the keyboard.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Lenovo suggests the Snapdragon platform will help deliver responsive performance, dependable WiFi connectivity and an extended battery life. The ARM-based Windows experience hasn&#39;t historically <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5g-review-windows-on-arm-snapdragon-pc-140042969.html"><ins>been</ins></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-microsoft-surface-pro-x-hands-on-arm-windows.html"><ins>great</ins></a>, but we haven&#39;t seen Windows 11 running on Snapdragon 7c chipsets as yet. Microsoft has seemingly improved the Windows-on-ARM experience, however.&nbsp;</p><p>The 10w Tablet and keyboard bundle starts at $239 and it&#39;s expected to ship in the US in April.</p><p>For (perhaps older) students who need extra power, Lenovo is also planning to ship the 13w Yoga convertible laptop in April. The system is powered by an AMD Ryzen 5000 U-series processor with on-chip graphics.</p><p>The laptop has a 13.3-inch, Full HD display with 300 nits of brightness. The front-facing 1080p camera has a privacy shutter and you&#39;ll find a 5MP camera on the rear. There&#39;s an optional fingerprint reader on the power button too.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d04aca50-7872-11ec-bf0b-b16b11e0f20d" style="height:1466;width:2000;" alt="Lenovo 13w Yoga " data-uuid="a27a6839-8b69-3e1e-b2f3-0c0af0ec712e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lenovo</div></figure><p>The 13w Yoga includes up to 16GB of 3200Mhz DDR4 RAM (which users can upgrade) and up to a 512GB SSD. Lenovo says it has Dolby Audio and a 51Whr battery.</p><p>The connectivity options are far more generous than on the 10w Tablet. Along with an audio jack, there are two USB-C 3.2 ports, one USB-A 3.2 port, a full SD card reader and HDMI 2.0. There&#39;s WiFi 6 and optional 4G LTE support as well. The 13w Yoga will start at $749.</p><p>In addition, Lenovo announced a partnership with VictoryXR to offer educational experiences in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-26-lenovo-vr-classroom-daydream-headsets.html"><ins>virtual reality</ins></a>. Students will be able to access more than 60 VR titles from VictoryXR, centered around science, history and career and technical education.

The all-you-can-play offering now has over 25 million subscribers, a nearly 39 percent jump over the 18 million it had a year earlier. The company didn&#39;t say how many of those customers were using the service on Xbox consoles, Windows PCs or both.</p><p>It&#39;s a significant figure for the service, if not as big as the company would have liked. As <em>Axios</em><a href="https://www.axios.com/xbox-microsoft-subscription-gaming-d047cf43-e9b4-4a33-bd25-1ab2c0ad9346.html">noted</a>, Microsoft missed its Game Pass growth target for the fiscal year that ended in June 2021 — it hoped for a 48 percent year-over-year jump in members, but &#39;only&#39; managed 37 percent. While this was still strong and preceded the release of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-review-campaign-xbox-microsoft-080158610.html"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a>, the company is clearly eager to improve Game Pass&#39; performance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That, in turn, explains one of the reasons for the Activision Blizzard deal. Microsoft has made clear that it intends to offer Activision Blizzard games through Game Pass. The $10 or more you&#39;re asked to pay each month might become far more compelling if you know you&#39;ll always have the latest Call of Duty or World of Warcraft release on top of Game Pass&#39; other titles. Although the merger might not complete until 2023, it could preserve Game Pass&#39; momentum and help fend off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-xbox-game-pass-subscription-sparatcus-175650996.html">looming competition from Sony</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-game-pass-25-million-subscribers-151432036.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">59cee312-2f9a-43b1-82c1-364eb80a31be</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:14:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642518874</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T15:14:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ca9c8860-786c-11ec-b53b-9a834fa97d0b" width="6108" height="4072" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ca9c8860-786c-11ec-b53b-9a834fa97d0b" width="6108" height="4072" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Christian Petersen via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - JUNE 10:  Ashley Speicher, Xbox Game Pass exec, speaks during the Microsoft xBox E3 briefing at the Microsoft Theater on June 10, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.

The clip promised an unflinching look at Yankovic’s life with performances from actors like Aaron Paul, Olvia Wilde and Gary Cole. We’re not about to get that film (sadly), but Roku may just give us the next best thing.</p><div id="7f77a8b1ace84ceb8ba379f86c7c9c41"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcNuiri2dV0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company announced today it’s backing production on <em>WEIRD: The Weird Al Jankovic Story</em>. Instead of Aaron Paul as Yankovic, we get Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe. Eric Appel, best known for his work on <em>Silicon Valley</em> and <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>, co-wrote the film’s script alongside Yankovic and is directing the project.

While there appear to be some cosmetic changes, you&#39;ll have the chance to revisit the sniper-friendly clock tower, scour restaurants for items and otherwise take a nostalgia trip.

The grenade launcher has returned with more direct firing and rounds that explode after their first bounce.

Today, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Weber" href="https://fave.co/3AdJl2S">Weber</a> announced it&#39;s 2022 lineup of smart grills with options for cooks who prefer gas or pellet-burning options. No matter the fuel source, all of the new models teased here are equipped with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-24-weber-smokefire-weber-connect-behind-the-scenes.html">the company&#39;s WiFi-enabled Weber Connect technology</a>. With it, you can control and monitor your grill from your phone, keeping tabs on the cooking process while you work on side dishes or relax with guests.&nbsp;</p><p>Weber Connect was first available on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-03-weber-connect-smart-grilling-hub-review.html">Smart Grilling Hub</a>, but its big debut came on the first-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-smokefire-review-wifi-pellet-grill-140000499.html">SmokeFire pellet grills</a>. The technology not only provides recipes, but it also guides you through the entire cooking process on a step-by-step basis, from how to prepare meat to when to flip and how long to rest before slicing. In a bid to outsmart the competition, the app also provides <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-june-acquisition-weber-connect-june-oven-200000677.html">estimated doneness times</a> so you&#39;re not left guessing when that brisket will finally hit 205 degrees Fahrenheit. In 2021, the company brought the technology <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-connect-smart-gas-grills-171237945.html">to its Genesis line</a> of gas grills, offering the same convenience as SmokeFire with a more commonly used fuel source — plus the ability to monitor your propane tank level.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For 2022, Weber is taking convenience a step further with a range of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:new Genesis gas grills" href="https://fave.co/3Kpj0Dm">new Genesis gas grills</a> and a new version of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:SmokeFire" href="https://fave.co/3BvlURV">SmokeFire</a>. First, the Genesis lineup of smart grills still feature Weber Connect on top of PureBlu high-heat burners, sear zone, side table, expandable top cooking grate and &quot;Nightvision.&quot; As the name implies that last item allows you to see the grilling surface after dark, with motion-sensing LEDs that can illuminate the entire cooking area when you open the lid — including the side tables/burner. The lights are on the reverse side of the handle, with a power button on outside to turn them completely off. Weber says the new Genesis models will come in both three- and four-burner options as well as models with porcelain-enamel or stainless steel finishes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/6a44e250-780d-11ec-bf46-1422841f989a" alt="Weber SmokeFire Stealth Edition" data-uuid="00d2ab58-5ce6-3b65-9b7d-ffcdf08deb8f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Weber</div></figure><p>For the SmokeFire pellet grill this year, Weber is going all black. Dubbed <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:the Stealth Edition" href="https://fave.co/3qFuD1u">the Stealth Edition</a>, the black-on-black color scheme nixes the silver accents from the original along the sides of the lid, the side shelf and the handles. Weber Connect is still on board, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-smokefire-grills-update-smokeboost-remote-control-firmware-173014646.html">helping you with everything</a> from high heat searing to low-and-slow smoking.

The collection of tools includes a dual-sided sear grate, flat-top griddle, baking stone (for pizza, etc), roasting basket, wok/steamer combo and rotisserie skewers. Special grates and an insert allow you to swap out the accessories on charcoal, gas or pellet grills. The company explains that these add-ons let you steam, bake, roast and more, and you can do so on the grill rather than having to venture inside. Plus, the new Genesis grills have a compartment and hooks for storing the new goods.

These side-scrolling skateboarding games start out easily enough, but if you want to complete every challenge, get ready to play and replay some levels dozens of times over. It can be infuriating, but also extremely satisfying to pull off just the right combo of tricks and grinds needed for a big score.</p><p>I was worried that <em>OlliOlli World</em>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/olliolli-world-preview-interview-e3-160000184.html">a new direction</a> for the series that arrives on February 8th, was going to dispense with that level of challenge. After playing an extended preview of the game over the last week, I’m no longer concerned. Developer Roll7 has made a game that’s significantly more approachable than the original titles — but one that keeps the twitch-response gameplay and score-chasing highs intact for those who crave them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For the uninitiated, <em>OlliOlli World</em> is a, 2.5D skateboarding platformer where your character simply has to make it from one end of the course to the other while pulling off as many tricks and combos as possible. That’s the same basic formula as the original games, but the scope of <em>OlliOlli World</em> is <em>much</em> greater. The game is split into five different areas, three of which were playable in my demo. The first one, Sunshine Valley, had close to 20 distinct levels, a handful of which were merely training levels meant to introduce the basics of skating, grinding and pulling off different tricks. But even if you don’t count those levels, there’s far more to explore in <em>OlliOlli World</em> than the two earlier games, each of which had 50 levels total.</p><div id="43869159fd444fe4921a1db0047a9532"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEFe58V7FtU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>There’s a host of ways to challenge yourself as you skate through these levels. For starters, you need to navigate grind rails, gaps, ramps and other obstacles to get to the end before you can progress. In a concession to the game’s history of bruising difficulty, though, levels now have checkpoints — so if you blow it 90 percent of the way through the level, you can try that last segment again. Of course, if you had a huge combo going that got interrupted, you’ll lose out on that opportunity for big points. But this at least makes it easier to learn levels and work on problem spots without having to tackle the entire course again.</p><p>But the levels are both extremely well designed and visually interesting, so I was eager to play and replay them until I mastered all the challenges and found as many secrets as I possibly could. The world is populated with colorful and fantastical creatures like walking bananas, smiling trees, giant bees holding signs for you to wall ride on, huge frogs (sometimes riding those giant bees) and, of course, the Skate Godz that you meet at the end of each world.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d66d8e40-762e-11ec-bbee-489618b599b3" alt="OlliOlli World" data-uuid="1f04f36d-62ac-3c95-8c0d-7e24d8ace70b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roll7</div></figure><p>See, your character is on a quest to become the new Skate Wizard, with the help of a goofy and delightful animated crew, including Chiffon, the one-eyed, pipe-smoking current Skate Wizard who’s ready to retire. To take their place, you’ll need to meet all of the Skate Godz that inhabit the five different zones you can play through. Each level has some banter with your crew as well as people you meet on your journeys, full of ridiculous puns and occasional advice on how to improve your scores or pull off new moves. You can skip it if you want, but it helped me get in the headspace of the gorgeous world of Radlandia.</p><p>It’s hard to sum up in words what makes the individual levels in <em>OlliOlli World</em> so compelling, but they mix serious challenge in with moments that let you really get into that elusive flow state, where you’re just pulling off tricks, riding rails and generally tearing through a course without thinking too much about what you’re doing. The music, sound effects, art style, level design and variety of moves you can pull off all contribute to this vibe — and even though the game looks entirely different from its predecessors, the end result is the same: skateboarding bliss.</p><p>My skills from the original OlliOlli games translated here, but there are plenty of new things to challenge long-time players. The game isn’t straight 2D anymore, which means there are multiple paths you can discover through many levels, something that seriously adds to replayability and challenge of these levels. Each level has multiple goals you’re presented with at the beginning, and meeting them all will almost certainly require multiple plays, especially as the game goes on and the tracks get more complex.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, by the time I got about halfway through the third world in the game, I was seriously struggling to check off all of a level&#39;s goals. The good news is you can keep progressing without beating all three challenges, nor are you penalized for using checkpoints, but the game is so well designed that I wanted to keep going back and trying to best my earlier scores and nail those goals.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f196ae40-762e-11ec-bef7-05d7de864641" alt="OlliOlli World" data-uuid="ea7da2f6-d3fe-3f01-83e1-8106dfeb7d41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roll7</div></figure><p>There are plenty of new moves like grabs to pull off, and quarter-pipes let you change the direction your skater is going in. It sounds simple, but having your skater go right-to-left instead of the opposite really threw me for a loop, but I also audibly cheered the first time I skated into one of those quarter-pipes. They add a whole new dimension to the game that I wasn’t expecting.</p><p>It’s also worth mentioning some of the other ways Roll7 made this game more approachable than the earlier ones. Besides the aforementioned checkpoints, it’s a lot harder to wipe out now. Earlier games required you to press a button when landing, or else you’d lose all your momentum as well as the points you accumulated from a trick. Now, you can land without having to worry about that step — but pulling off so-called “perfect” landings increases your speed and score.</p><p>The main game is a deep experience, but Roll7 added new features for those who love to chase high scores. Every time you finish a level, you’ll see a rival player’s score that you’re then challenged to best. It’s subtle, just showing your rival’s high score beneath your best score — but these challenges taunted me into playing a few extra rounds to try and beat that challenge. <em>OlliOlli World</em> is smart enough to match you with players of your own skill level, so if your high score tops out at 100,000, you won’t be challenged to beat someone who got 1 million on a level; the rival scores are usually around 20 percent higher than your own best. It’s good encouragement to push yourself even harder through a level.</p><p><em>OlliOlli World </em>also offers daily challenges through the Gnarvana League, which you unlock once you finish the game’s first area. Here, you join a league where you’re pitted against nine competitors who again skate at a similar skill level to you. The levels change every day, and you’re simply trying to put up the best score in your group. As you play, you can get promoted to other leagues, where the courses presumably will get trickier. I’ll readily admit that after putting up a score that put me on top of my group, I kept my eyes on the league throughout the day to see if I’d have to replay it and improve my score to keep that top spot.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1a761710-762f-11ec-bbff-e2e55e579a14" alt="OlliOlli World" data-uuid="455d3edf-3e85-3f04-ba1f-f41dc044ddb0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roll7</div></figure><p>Finally, there’s a random level generator that you can use to challenge your friends or strangers to put up their best score. The Gnarvana Portal is extremely simple, letting you pick a level’s “style,” which is based on the five main worlds in the game. You can then choose one of four difficulty levels and set the course’s length. Once it’s generated, you can share that course via an eight-digit postcode. That code lets anyone else try your level, regardless of what platform they’re playing on, and you again compete to see who can put up the highest score. The fun thing is that anyone can try this, so you can give the postcode to a few close friends, or post it online and challenge anyone you want.</p><p>For the first time in an OlliOlli game, you can also customize your character to your heart&#39;s content. There are a ton of clothing options, hairstyles, skateboard designs, skin color options and much more here, and you&#39;ll unlock much more as you check off the different challenges each level offers. Unlike the first two games&#39; single, generic male skater design, you can make a character here that truly fits your personality.</p><p>There’s a ton of game here for $30, and the Roll7 team has at least two DLC expansions planned for later this year (both of which are included if you order the $45 Rad Edition). If you have even a passing interest in skateboarding or platformer games, <em>OlliOlli World</em> is absolutely worth your time. It’s deeper, brighter, bigger and more fun than the original games, and I expect it’ll be a hit with hardcore OlliOllli fanatics as well as a much bigger new audience experiencing the thrill of this meditative skating series for the first time.</p><p>OlliOlli World<em> will be available on the Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC on February 8th.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/olliolli-world-gameplay-preview-140021521.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c86434b8-e865-4a22-81e0-a4ed28ca29c3</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 14:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642513887</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T13:51:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/920846d0-762b-11ec-9faf-98c7f7758bc6" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/920846d0-762b-11ec-9faf-98c7f7758bc6" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roll7]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OlliOlli World]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OlliOlli World]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft is buying Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft just made one of the largest-ever bids for a game studio. The company has <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/14/__trashed/">announced</a> plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $95 per share, valuing the all-cash deal at an enormous $68.7 billion. The deal would make the combined entity the &quot;third-largest&quot; game company by revenue, according to Microsoft, and would put titles like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Candy Crush</em> under the company&#39;s wing. Microsoft plans to add Activision Blizzard games to Game Pass as part of the deal.</p><p>Mobile gaming is also a significant factor in the acquisition, Microsoft said. On top of folding King&#39;s phone games into Microsoft&#39;s business, the purchase promises to bring franchises like <em>Halo</em> and <em>Warcraft</em> to more devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The buyout is expected to close sometime in Microsoft&#39;s fiscal 2023 (no later than June 2023) if regulators and Activision Blizzard shareholders greenlight the move. The boards of directors for both companies have already approved the deal.</p><p>While news of the acquisition comes as Activision Blizzard is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-departures-discipline-bobby-kotick-212356578.html">embroiled in a misconduct scandal</a>, you shouldn&#39;t expect significant leadership changes. Bobby Kotick will remain Activision Blizzard&#39;s CEO despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html">calls for his resignation</a>, and will now report to Microsoft Gaming chief Phil Spencer. Separately, though, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-to-buy-activision-blizzard-games-11642512435?mod=e2tw">the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reports</a> that Kotick will leave shortly after the deal is complete, a move that wouldn&#39;t be unexpected given the that Spencer will be leading Microsoft&#39;s gaming efforts. In a <a href="https://activisionblizzard.com/newsroom/2022/01/defining-the-future">company letter</a>, Kotick described Microsoft&#39;s move as a chance to &quot;further strengthen&quot; Activision Blizzard&#39;s workplace culture and &quot;set a new standard&quot; for inclusiveness. He didn&#39;t outline specific plans for reform, but did say there would be &quot;minimal changes&quot; to staff counts after the union was complete.</p><p>If it moves forward, the merger would help Microsoft compete with heavyweights <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tencent-sumo-acquisition-091425058.html">Tencent</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html">Sony</a>, which have both been on buying sprees in recent months. Kotick also saw this helping his company better compete as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a> gaming rises to prominence. In that light, this may be as much a matter of future-proofing the company as anything else.</p><p>Some major questions remain, though. Microsoft didn&#39;t say how many Activision Blizzard games would be Xbox-exclusive on consoles, or Windows-exclusive on computers. It&#39;s also unclear how much Microsoft might influence development of key franchises. It&#39;s not certain Microsoft will lock <em>Call of Duty</em> or other giant games to the Xbox in the near future, though — PlayStation sales represent a large chunk of Activision Blizzard&#39;s revenue, and dropping that platform would significantly reduce the company&#39;s clout in the games industry.</p><p>CEO Bobby Kotick&#39;s letter to Activision Blizzard employees is below:</p><p><em>Team,</em></p><p><em>Today is an incredibly exciting day. As we continue our journey to connect and engage the world through epic entertainment, we will eventually do so as part of Microsoft. I am certain that our incredible talent and extraordinary games combined with our shared commitment to the very best workplace will enable us to grow in an increasingly more competitive race for leadership as gaming through the metaverse evolves.</em></p><p><strong><em>How we got here and where we’re going</em></strong></p><p><em>When you reflect on what we’ve built together, we have so much to be proud of. For the last 31 years, we’ve continuously shaped gaming through our commitment to deliver joy, fun, and the thrill of accomplishment.</em></p><p><em>We’ve transformed games into social experiences and enabled players to find purpose and meaning through the most engaging form of entertainment – our games. By doing so, we’ve created and entertained communities of hundreds of millions of players.</em></p><p><em>Connecting these communities together is the next step. Facebook, Google, Tencent, NetEase, Amazon, Apple, Sony, Disney – and many more – have ambitions for their own gaming and metaverse initiatives. Established and emerging competitors see opportunity for virtual worlds filled with professionally produced content, user generated content and rich social connections.</em></p><p><em>Our talent and our games are important components of the construction of a rich metaverse. We have always attracted the very best game makers and built the very best games, seizing opportunity with passion, inspiration, focus, and determination.</em></p><p><strong><em>A partnership to define the future</em></strong></p><p><em>As investments in cloud computing, AI and machine learning, data analytics, and user interface and experience capabilities are becoming more competitive, we believe this partnership will better enable our ambitions.</em></p><p><em>In considering possible partners, all roads ultimately lead to Microsoft. Like us, they have been making games for a long time. Microsoft has already distributed games to hundreds of millions of the world’s computers and computing devices and has technologies and innovation that will support the next generation of games.</em></p><p><em>Microsoft also will support our journey to further strengthen our culture. Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO, has been a passionate advocate for caring as the currency of leadership. Inspiring people through empathy is a powerful motivator, and one we embrace as we renew our resolve – and in the work we are now doing – to set a new standard for a welcoming and inclusive workplace culture.</em></p><p><em>Importantly, Microsoft wants you – your talent, your creativity, and your dedication to each other. Activision Blizzard’s success throughout the years can be directly attributed to each of you. Microsoft recognizes the commitment to excellence and creative independence that sets us apart, and we anticipate minimal changes for our workforce following the close of the transaction. Microsoft’s diverse operations will give us access to valuable expertise, technology, and tools and provide even greater opportunities for learning and development.</em></p><p><em>No organization’s culture, including ours, is without need for improvement, and thanks to your input, we are making strides in improving ours. My commitment is to continue evolving our culture so that come closing, Microsoft is acquiring an exemplary workplace.</em></p><p><strong><em>What’s next</em></strong></p><p><em>Transactions like these can take a long time to complete. Until we receive all the necessary regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions are satisfied, which we expect to be sometime in Microsoft’s fiscal 2023 year ending June 30, 2023, we will continue to operate completely autonomously. I will continue as our CEO with the same passion and enthusiasm I had when I began this amazing journey in 1991.</em></p><p><em>Of course, this announcement will give rise to so many questions. We will host numerous forums and events to make certain we address your concerns.</em></p><p><em>I am incredibly proud of this company, you, and the work we have done together. Now it’s on to our next chapter and the endless possibilities this transaction represents for us. I couldn’t be more appreciative of your efforts, focus, and the dedication to connecting the world through joy and fun.</em></p><p><em>With gratitude,</em></p><p><em>Bobby</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">152c8376-8283-4bde-8c80-4dc05e873f6f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 13:36:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642533473</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T19:18:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6a50220-7862-11ec-bc3d-ed585414cdfe" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6a50220-7862-11ec-bc3d-ed585414cdfe" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK government announces official crackdown on 'misleading' crypto ads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK government has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-strengthen-rules-on-misleading-cryptocurrency-adverts">revealed</a> that it plans to update its laws in order &quot;to bring the promotion of cryptoassets within the scope of financial promotions legislation.&quot; That will ensure any crypto promotion will be held to the same standards as promotion for stocks, shares and insurance products.

That means people may not be fully aware of the risks involved when it comes to investing in them, which further supports &quot;the case for regulatory intervention to ensure that cryptoasset promotions are fair, clear, and not misleading. &quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-announces-plan-to-set-stricter-rules-for-crypto-ads-132529935.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a51eb30-1399-4f65-9d8a-3aaa59b62970</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 13:25:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642511015</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T13:03:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5e108980-7858-11ec-9cfd-0140d2b38a27" width="3835" height="2158" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5e108980-7858-11ec-9cfd-0140d2b38a27" width="3835" height="2158" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vagengeym_Elena via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Faceless girl holds golden physical bitcoin and shows Okay sign, thumbs up, ok gesture.

However, <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/84041">multiple users have noticed</a> that Google recently changed that to something that loops more frequently and has a muffled sound, according to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/15/google-home-white-noise/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>. As a result, they and their infants and toddlers are apparently losing sleep over it.</p><p>&quot;White noise&quot; is among the 14 ambient noises available from Google Assistant, along with &quot;babbling brook,&quot; &quot;fireplace,&quot; &quot;ocean&quot; and <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/7364558?hl=en">others</a>. You can play them for up to 12 hours if not disabled by a sleep timer, and the 2nd-gen Nest Hub has an &quot;auto-off&quot; feature that turns off the sound once you fall asleep.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Previously, it looped the White Noise sound every hour, but now the sound is repeated every 10 minutes, something users find annoying and repetitive. On top of that, the previously crisp sound file is now apparently &quot;muffled&quot; and quieter than before. &quot;It&#39;s a different pitch, almost muffled,&quot; said one user. &quot;Very annoying you have to set the volume to 70 percent,&quot; another noted.&nbsp;</p><p>There are at least 100 complaints along the same lines, with many people saying they use the white noise to get their babies or toddlers to sleep. &quot;I play it every night for my toddler and she&#39;s really upset about this change,&quot; said one. &quot;Please, let there be a way to get the older version back so we can maintain our sleep schedule and sanity!&quot;</p><p>Google may have changed the file to reduce data usage, as one Redditor said that his Mini used about 4GB of data every night just playing Google&#39;s ambient noises. Another acknowledged that this is a &quot;first world problem,&quot; but it goes to show how tiny changes in widely used technology can cause unintended problems. If you use the old sound and miss it, another Reddit user has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/s4b30o/white_noise_ambient_sound_has_changed/">uploaded the original</a> to Google Drive, so you could in theory download it and cast to YouTube Music.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-changed-the-white-noise-on-nest-devices-and-users-are-not-happy-125022202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b6965ef-d57b-461a-9d2a-be6758b79317</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 12:50:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642510115</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T12:48:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7cfe08b0-7851-11ec-bddf-8e9f67f94533" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7cfe08b0-7851-11ec-bddf-8e9f67f94533" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google changed the 'white noise' on Nest devices and users are not having it]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google changed the 'white noise' on Nest devices and users are not having it]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Spain sets rules (and fines) for cryptocurrency promotion]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Governments are paying more attention to the rise and rise of cryptocurrencies – and their tax implications – whether it’s the major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum or newcomers looking to pick up users, investors and headlines.</p><p>In Spain, influencers and other advertisers with more than 100,000 followers will soon have to notify the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) at least 10 days before plugging crypto assets.

The premium range of multi-sport GPS watches has come a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/garmin-fenix-instinct-tactix-solar-110041267.html">long way</a> over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-18-garmin-fenix-5-plus-gps-watch.html">the last</a> 10 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-20-garmin-fenix-2-gps-watch.html">years</a>, and the new 7-series adds a few new tricks.&nbsp;</p><p>Most notably, Fenix 7 line will now include touchscreens. It might seem something of an odd omission thus far, but the great outdoors tends to mean gloves, sweat, motion and the elements — all of which can play havoc with a touchscreen. As such, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how responsive it is under active conditions. Although other Garmin watches, like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-04-garmin-venu-great-fitness-wearable.html">Venu</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-05-garmin-vivoactive-watch-release-date-price-hands-on.html">vivoactive</a> lines, have had touchscreens for a while so this isn&#39;t a first for the company by any stretch, but a new addition to the Fenix line.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="acb5704a5edb47b9aac8fb3fec17a57f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9b2stk6VDg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Another addition includes a new multi-LED flashlight. Handy for those camping trips or early morning/late night runs. Not only is it a general-purpose light, but it can also alternate between red and white as you run, matching your personal cadence, so traffic or cyclists can be alerted to your presence (and direction).</p><p>As usual, the Fenix comes in three models/sizes: the 7S/7 and premium 7X which measure 42, 47 and 51 mm across respectively. All have solar-charging options and Garmin claims the new casing includes a larger screen surface area which could see solar gains doubling over the Fenix 6 line. This potentially puts the total time between charges (without using GPS) at up to five weeks, which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch of this size.</p><p>Beyond the hardware changes on the Fenix, there are some new advanced training modes too. These include Real-Time Stamina, Visual Race Predictor, Recovery Time Advison and Daily Workout Suggestions. These features join the already extensive offering of topo-maps, golf courses and surf/snow features that lie hidden within the Fenix&#39;s extensive sporting options.</p><p>All the models and varieties in the Fenix 7 line are available as of today, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:starting at $700" href="https://fave.co/3GGKVwy">starting at $700</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/garmin-fenix-7-series-touchscreen-flaslight-120021147.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">11fa20ce-0103-40a7-8cab-2d7ada28f1c1</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 12:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642512326</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T13:25:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d890c360-7852-11ec-b7fb-f2ab14d0fb4e" width="1200" height="600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d890c360-7852-11ec-b7fb-f2ab14d0fb4e" width="1200" height="600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Garmin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Garmin Fenix 7 series adds touchscreens and an cadence-matching flashlight.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Garmin Fenix 7]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Logitech's new 'Pen' is a rechargeable stylus for classroom Chromebooks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Logitech has launched a new stylus called the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Logitech Pen" href="https://fave.co/3fzXE8h">Logitech Pen</a> designed specifically with K-12 students in mind. It will work with touchscreen Chromebooks that support the Universal Stylus Initiative (USI) standard and is Works with Chromebooks certified. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-01-google-universal-stylus-initiative.html">backed</a> the initiative in 2018 and joined other supporters like Intel and Lenovo in their quest to create an open active stylus standard, and a bunch of manufacturers has released USI-compatible Chromebooks over the years since then.&nbsp;</p><p>The Logitech Pen works with various models across brands, namely Lenovo, Acer, HP, Asus and Samsung. Michele Hermann, Vice President of Mobility and Head of Education Solutions at Logitech, said in a statement: &quot;Given that students and educators are increasingly using Chromebooks as an everyday tool in schools and at home, we created the Logitech Pen to unlock the full potential of Chromebooks in the classroom.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Logitech Pen has a silicone grip, non-slip design and comes in a size that even children can hold comfortably. Its active tip features 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity — that&#39;s the same pressure levels as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-151216222.html">Surface Slim Pen 2</a> — and can simulate writing on paper more closely than a stylus with a rubber tip or a finger can. As per the standard, the Logitech Pen doesn&#39;t need to be paired beforehand, so students can just pick it up and use it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pen&#39;s battery can last for up to 15 days with regular school use and can be charged using a standard USB-C Charger. And, since it&#39;s designed for students, it&#39;s also spill-proof and has military-grade drop protection of up to four feet.

Now, Square Enix has <a href="https://press.uk.square-enix.com/BELOVED-KINGDOM-HEARTS-TITLES-COMING-TO-NINTENDO-SWITCH-VIA-CLOUD-ON-F">announced</a> that the three games, <em>Kingdom Hearts - HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMix</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue </em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Kingdom%20Hearts%20III"><em>Kingdom Hearts III</em></a> will arrive to Switch via cloud on February 10th for a rather exorbitant $90, or $72 on pre-order.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#39;s essentially the entire series so far, covering Sora&#39;s journey up to the most recent chapter, <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>. The series is one Square Enix&#39;s <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Best_selling_Square-Enix_games">best-selling franchises</a> of all time, particularly the original and <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> titles.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4d7dab0d6e5f43eea8749e89811e173d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J0CQp7npkeQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Because the Switch trilogy is a cloud version, you&#39;ll need a reasonably fast internet connection to have a decent experience. While a cloud release seems valid for the latest <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> chapter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-10-kingdom-hearts-iii-release-date.html">first released</a> on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, one has to wonder why the first two games couldn&#39;t have been remade to run directly on the Switch. After all, it can run <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-20-the-witcher-3-switch-hands-on.html"><em>Witcher 3</em></a> and the Assassin&#39;s Creed collection that&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-the-ezio-collection-nintendo-switch-february-17-202041391.html">set to arrive</a> on February 18th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By purchasing the all-in-one collection or individual<em> Kingdom Hearts III</em> version, you&#39;ll receive the Advent Red Keyblade for use in the <em>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind (DLC)</em>, Square Enix said. There will also be a Kingdom Hearts <a href="https://twitter.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1483320750001905667">20th anniversary event</a> in Tokyo, with a mini concert, Q&amp;A with the development team, an exhibition and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The collection is <a href="https://www.kingdomhearts.com/switch/en-us/">now available for pre-order</a> at $72. If that&#39;s too much, you can pre-order individual titles for prices varying from $33 to $40. The trilogy price climbs to $90 afterwards, so if you&#39;re interested, try to pick it up ahead of the February 10th release date.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 1/18/2022 6:15 AM ET</strong>: Pre-order and full pricing added.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kingdom-hearts-trilogy-is-coming-to-the-switch-on-february-10th-103034500.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6189b547-852f-4ea6-9045-92007600e32c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 10:30:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642504876</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T11:21:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/968766f0-7847-11ec-adf9-cb6575c9861c" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/968766f0-7847-11ec-adf9-cb6575c9861c" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Kingdom Hearts' trilogy for cloud is coming to the Nintendo Switch on February 10th]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Kingdom Hearts' trilogy for cloud is coming to the Nintendo Switch on February 10th]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Exynos 2200 mobile processor uses an AMD ray tracing GPU]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung has revealed the <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-game-changing-exynos-2200-processor-with-xclipse-gpu-powered-by-amd-rdna-2-architecture">Exynos 2200</a>, its first mobile processor with an AMD RDNA 2-powered GPU that will allow ray-tracing and other gaming features.
