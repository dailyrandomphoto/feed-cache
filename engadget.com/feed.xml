Senior software engineering VP Craig Federighi told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in an interview that introducing both the scans for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on iCloud and opt-in local monitoring of iMessage sexual content was a &quot;recipe for this kind of confusion.&quot; People conflated the two and thought that Apple might spy on messages, Federighi claimed, adding that he wished Apple had &quot;come out a little more clearly.&quot;</p><p>The executive maintained that Apple was striking the right balance between child safety and privacy, and addressed some of the concerns that surfaced since the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-ios-15-193820644.html">announced its new measures</a> in early August. He stressed that the scans of iCloud-destined photos would only flag existing images in a CSAM database, not any picture in your library. The system only sends an alert when you reach a threshold of 30 images, so false positives aren&#39;t likely.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The system also has &quot;multiple levels of auditability,&quot; Federighi said. On-device scanning will reportedly make it easier for researchers to check if Apple ever misused the technology.  Federighi also rejected the notion that the technique might be used to scan for other material, such as politics, noting that the database of images comes from multiple child safety groups, not just the agency that will receive any red-flag reports (the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children).</p><p>The response won&#39;t satisfy those who object to the very notion that Apple is scanning photos on their phones, even with privacy protections in place. It is, however, a recognition that it can be a challenge to properly address privacy issues — it doesn&#39;t take much to prompt an uproar.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-on-confusion-over-child-safety-updates-csam-150121989.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f80fb9bf-28e4-41ff-9a9b-fcefc4836887</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 15:01:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628866883</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T15:01:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/95838b10-fc3e-11eb-b7ff-a4f65f41eba6" width="3810" height="2706" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/95838b10-fc3e-11eb-b7ff-a4f65f41eba6" width="3810" height="2706" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Justin Sullivan via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 03:  Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering Craig Federighi speaks during the keynote address during the 2019 Apple Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) at the San Jose Convention Center on June 03, 2019 in San Jose, California.

I bought into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/instantpot">Instant Pot</a> hype a few years ago and tried out an air fryer as well. (I ended up getting the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Breville Smart Oven Air" href="https://amzn.to/3CDBgFu">Breville Smart Oven Air</a>, a toaster oven with an air-frying setting.) I also own a host of other contraptions cluttering up my kitchen cabinets: a juicer, food processor, ice cream maker and <em>two</em> sous vide machines.</p><p>Yet, the appliance I use the most is the humble microwave. Like many of you, I use it mainly for reheating leftovers or warming up frozen dinners. I’ve never really considered using it for actual cooking, except for the occasional “microwave mug cake” recipe I’ve seen go viral on social media. Oh, I’ve heard of cookbooks from the ‘70s and ‘80s that tried to sell the public on the wonders of microwave cooking — I’m sure my mom even bought a few back in my youth — but those have largely turned out to be full of culinary deception. (A roast beef dinner via microwave? I don’t think so.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But a few months ago I saw an Instagram ad for a new line of cookware that was designed to be used specifically with the microwave. It’s called <a href="https://fave.co/2V5GbOh">Anyday</a>, and it was co-founded by renowned chef David Chang of Momofuku and Ugly Delicious fame. The ad showed luscious photos of mashed potatoes, mapo tofu, mac and cheese, and a chicken and pea dish that all looked really delicious. Could all of this really be made with just the microwave? Perhaps the best kitchen appliance was under my nose all along? Needless to say, I was intrigued.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/aaf93390-fa78-11eb-bbf3-20a272778099" alt="Anyday Cookware" data-uuid="ac9003db-cb85-3ebe-b4a1-aa20dcad3e3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>According to Anyday, the main thing differentiating its cookware from regular microwave-safe containers is its glass lid. It has a silicone gasket that blocks splatters and keeps moisture in, as well as a knob at the top that can be pulled out for steam to escape through air vents. The knob can also be pushed down to create an airtight leakproof seal, at which point the containers are also stackable. In contrast, my existing set of Pyrex containers just have regular plastic lids, which even the manufacturer recommends shouldn’t be used in the microwave since they can warp.</p><p>I should note here that the Anyday lids do have stainless steel rims, which you might think is a little dangerous to put in the microwave. But they’re actually safe on account of their smooth, curved shape, which prevents arcing. The company does warn against heating up two dishes at once, however, as the combination of two stainless steel lids might result in sparks flying.</p><p>Also, the Anyday dishes themselves are made of a frosted borosilicate glass which can withstand large temperature fluctuations without cracking. This last part is important, as certain ceramics and glass aren’t completely microwave safe. For example, I tried heating up a potato once on a plate I bought from IKEA, and it ended up splitting in two. The plate, that is, not the potato.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2d695770-fa78-11eb-b7db-3af8518eb459" alt="Mac and Cheese in Anyday Cookware" data-uuid="77ec823a-39df-346b-b811-cc567c276251"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Still, I was a little skeptical. So I went ahead and purchased a <a href="https://fave.co/2V5GbOh">full set of Anyday cookware</a> just to try everything out. That’s four dishes total — shallow and deep in medium and large sizes — which is admittedly quite expensive at $120. Alternatively, you can get the <a href="https://fave.co/3wnvQdo">medium set</a> of two dishes for $55 or the <a href="https://fave.co/3BUrrCA">large set</a> for $75. You can also opt to buy each dish separately; the two medium ones go for $30 a piece while the large options are $40 a piece. That definitely makes this pretty pricey compared to an average set of microwave-safe containers — a full 18-piece Snapware Pyrex set, for example, is just $30.</p><p>The Anyday set comes with several recipe cards, which are very handy to start out with, but the best place to find recipes is on the Anyday website. You’ll find everything from one-ingredient recipes (e.g., you just want to steam some rice) to full recipes such as black bean soup and squash curry. On each recipe page, you can select your desired serving size as well as the wattage of your specific microwave oven, which will determine variables such as dish size, cook time and what power level you should use.</p><p>I’ve used the Anyday cookware for several weeks now, and I’ve actually been mostly impressed with the results. The first recipe I tried was a chicken and rice meal with peas and marinara sauce. I was nervous about whether it would work, but it turned out to be delicious, with the chicken cooked through to the bone and the rice tender and fluffy. The Thai pineapple chicken recipe also worked out well. I think I would’ve preferred it if the onions were browned and caramelized like they would be on the stove, but for microwave cooking, it was completely satisfactory.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e3b7f20-fa78-11eb-bebf-14b201f59ba7" alt="Anyday Cookware" data-uuid="3ac00efc-e4df-3e03-a6c7-96a224fddf29"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>One dish in particular was a revelation for me: Silky Chinese steamed egg. This is a recipe that can be quite tricky to master on the stove, as you need to steam it slowly over a gentle heat. But in the microwave, it’s a matter of heating the custard solution at a lower power level for just four to five minutes, depending on your microwave wattage. (The company&#39;s site recommends Power Level 4.)  I’ve never really fiddled around with my microwave’s power settings before, but now that I see it can result in a smooth custard, I will definitely be using it more often.</p><p>Another killer application, at least for me, is poached eggs. I usually find poaching eggs to be a bit of a chore; you have to heat up a pot of water, carefully drop in the egg and hope you’re able to rescue it when it’s done just right. It’s especially challenging when it’s six in the morning and I haven’t had my coffee just yet. But with the Anyday and the microwave, all I have to do is fill up a shallow dish with cold water straight from the tap, crack an egg into it, cover it, nuke it for two minutes and it’s done. The yolk is cooked just enough so that it’s a little runny, which is how I like it. I almost couldn’t believe it.</p><p>The experience wasn’t perfect, however. For example, I tried using the Anyday to cook white rice, and even though I followed the recipe exactly, the water in the dish boiled over, pushing the lid up and spilling out into the microwave. As a result, the rice wasn’t cooked correctly, and I had to add the water back in and cook it further. I tried cooking the rice in a much larger dish later on and it worked out better, but I wish the site had suggested that instead of me finding out on my own.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5044ae70-fa78-11eb-aff7-f6e6313688ef" alt="Silky Chinese Steamed Egg Custard via Anyday" data-uuid="b95e112e-d04f-3ac3-8c47-41e6ea3debd2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Speaking of the recipes, I should note that not all microwave ovens are the same, even among those with the same wattage. My microwave, for example, is apparently more powerful than normal, and it took way less time for me to steam broccoli than the site recommended. I also found that not all microwave ovens&#39; power levels are the same either. My Power Level 4 could be your Power Level 3. I definitely had to play around with different variables in order to get certain foods to cook properly.</p><p>Plus, there are certain kinds of cooking that the microwave just cannot do. You’re just not going to get the same kind of browning that you can get on the stove or in the oven. You can’t use it to deep fry or roast or bake. What you’re basically doing is steaming food, albeit in a more controlled way. The microwave won’t replace your stove or your oven or your Instant Pot completely.</p><p>But, for all its flaws, I still think the Anyday cookware is great. It’s made me realize that the microwave has a lot more uses than just reheating leftovers. It’s opened up a whole new world of culinary possibilities that I had not realized existed before. Sure, the mac and cheese I made in the microwave won’t be as amazing as the one baked in the oven, but the former can be done in under 10 minutes, and it still tastes creamy and cheesy. I’ve also made instant ramen in the Anyday and the microwave to great success.</p><p>It might not make the best food you’ve ever tasted, but for college students and time-pressed parents and professionals, the microwave might just be the most versatile appliance in the kitchen. As long as you have the right cookware for it anyway.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anyday-cookware-irl-hands-on-140042882.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d2390786-aac2-41c9-8fc0-0cd5d3afbbae</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 14:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628683975</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T12:13:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ad73e70-fa78-11eb-bf7d-e0a0f9a7be41" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ad73e70-fa78-11eb-bf7d-e0a0f9a7be41" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anyday Cookware]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anyday Cookware]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senators ask Amazon how it will use palm print data from its stores]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re concerned that Amazon might misuse <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-one-palm-recognition-go-stores-seattle-100718649.html">palm print data from its One service</a>, you&#39;re not alone. <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/amazon-biometric-data-senate-letter">reports</a> that Senators Amy Klobuchar, Bill Cassidy and Jon Ossoff have sent a letter to new Amazon chief <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-amazon-ceo-final-date-174948346.html">Andy Jassy</a> asking him to explain how the company might expand use of One&#39;s palm print system beyond stores like Amazon Go and Whole Foods.

Samsung&#39;s flagship tablets, the Tab S7 and S7+, are both on sale, while the already affordable Tab S6 Lite is even cheaper at $270. Here are the best tech deals we found in Best Buy&#39;s latest weekend sale.</p><h2>Google WiFi (3 pack)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c9536310-f5f5-11eb-bfb2-99dc60bb5966" style="height:491;width:708;" alt="Google WiFi" data-uuid="96dcb89a-adea-3707-b462-a9fb8e64dec6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Google&#39;s mesh WiFi kit" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/6bPNbb">Google&#39;s mesh WiFi kit</a> with one router and two access points is $50 off, bringing it down to $150 (Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:matching the deal" href="https://amzn.to/3ABBxH5">matching the deal</a> as well). This system came out at the end of last year and it supports speeds up to 1.2Gpbs. Each node covers up to 1,500 square feet, so you&#39;re getting a ton of coverage with this three-pack.

crypto hack</a>, the perpetrator who returned most of the $611 million in stolen digital tokens is being offered a $500,000 reward. The prize is a bug bounty to be precise, an incentive offered by tech organizations to those who report security vulnerabilities. In a statement, Poly Network referred to the culprit as a &quot;white hat&quot; in reference to his status as an ethical hacker. The decentralized finance platform thanked the hacker for &quot;helping to improve&quot; its security, but did not mention how it would pay the reward or whether it had been accepted.&nbsp;</p><div id="77756129a32f4e3ca4e3d98c7f0a9384"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">$342 million (As of 12 Aug 08:18:29 AM +UTC) of assets had been returned: <br>Ethereum: $4.6M <br>BSC: $252M <br>Polygon: $85M <br><br>The remaining is $268M on Ethereum</p>— Poly Network (@PolyNetwork2) <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425733950614360064?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>A person claiming to be the perpetrator confirmed that Poly Network had offered him a $500,000 bounty to return the stolen assets and promised that he would not be held accountable for the incident, according to messages shared on Twitter by Tom Robinson, the chief scientist and co-founder of Elliptic, a crypto tracking firm.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d2c3a0f189594a55939f1c9d4e7c0deb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s not over yet!

The company revealed on Tuesday that it was the victim of a massive crypto heist that saw a hacker make away with about $611 million in Ethereum, Shiba Inu and other digital currencies.&nbsp;</p><p>On Wednesday, the hacker began returning the stolen funds after claiming they were ready to surrender. Poly Network said on Friday that the hacker had repaid $340 million worth of assets into a digital wallet. All that remains is the $33 million in tether frozen by the company behind the cryptocurrency.</p><p>It&#39;s still unclear what prompted the hacker to backtrack. Some experts believe that they may have found it hard to launder and cash out the large amount of stolen crypto. While others suggest that the hacker was afraid of being exposed and prosecuted after researchers discovered a trove of identifying info, including an email and IP address.

This included a system to detect such material by scanning the images in people’s iCloud libraries, which has proved controversial.

The robot (pictured above) is played by Caleb Landry Jones, fresh off a best actor win at Cannes.&nbsp;</p><p>Hanks plays the titular character, an ailing robotics engineer who emerges from his self-imposed underground exile to journey across a desolate American wasteland. Along for the ride are his dog, Goodyear, and an android who names himself Jeff. Together, they make a dysfunctional family, but can they learn to get along? I guess we&#39;ll have to wait till November to find out.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Finch </em>is also loaded with offscreen talent. The good-natured sci-fi flick is directed by Emmy-winning <em>Game of Thrones</em> lead Miguel Sapochnik, with <em>Alien</em> scribe Ivor Powell and newcomer Craig Luck on screenwriting duties.

Company CEO Bob Chapek said during an earnings call that Disney has &quot;entered hundreds of talent arrangements with [its] talent and by and large, they&#39;ve gone very very smoothly.&quot; Chapek&#39;s statement comes in the wake of the lawsuit <em>Black Widow</em> star Scarlett Johansson <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html">filed</a> against the company over its streaming strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Johansson&#39;s salary was tied to the movie&#39;s box office success, and her original contract didn&#39;t cover earnings from a hybrid release. According to her complaint, she could lose over $50 million due to the company&#39;s decision to simultaneously launch <em>Black Widow</em> in theaters and on Disney+, where it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-opening-weekend-174633013.html">made $60 million</a> during its opening weekend.

In Johansson&#39;s complaint, she said her camp tried to renegotiate her deal with the company upon learning about the simultaneous release. However, Disney and Marvel were allegedly unresponsive.</p><p>Chapek also <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/marvels-shang-chi-set-to-hit-disney-plus-in-mid-october-possibly-free/#ftag=CAD590a51e">talked</a> about implementing an experimental release strategy for <em>Shang-Chi</em>. Unlike <em>Black Widow</em>, it will be a theater-exclusive for 45 days before making its way to Disney+. Further, subscribers may be able to watch it for free instead of having to pay extra for it like they&#39;ve had to do with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-mulan-date-232629863.html"><em>Mulan</em></a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-compensate-talent-black-widow-lawsuit-070554946.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">01ee3bb7-a0f8-4801-a037-ecc23c2081b5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 07:05:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628862197</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T13:43:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c2263280-fbf3-11eb-bed3-bf1de5baeb27" width="1600" height="993" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c2263280-fbf3-11eb-bed3-bf1de5baeb27" width="1600" height="993" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Black Widow]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Black Widow]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google makes Meet moderation easier by allowing up to 25 people to co-host]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It can be hard for a single host to manage large unruly video meetings, particularly given the complexity and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-filters-masks-ios-android-084044336.html">features</a> available in video conferencing apps these days.

All hosts will be able to limit who can share their screen, limit who can send chat messages, mute all with one click, end the meeting for all and control who can join the meeting and how they can join with the &quot;quick access&quot; setting. The latter allows participants in the same domain to enter automatically.&nbsp;</p><p>“Quick access” allows automatic video call entry for users in the same domain. If disabled, hosts must join first, and those that are not invited will have to request permission to enter. Otherwise, the host must join first and give permission to anyone who isn&#39;t invited.&nbsp;</p><p>The last feature, the &quot;People&quot; panel, adds search to let hosts quickly find participants if moderation actions are needed. The new features will begin rolling out next week on the web and Meet for Android, and the iOS version will arrive at the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-makes-moderation-easier-by-allowing-up-to-25-people-to-co-host-055344666.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">901ee10b-64c0-448a-b59a-f3d6ad475a58</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 05:53:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628834024</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T05:53:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4b2a47f0-fbfa-11eb-bd7d-619dd2837feb" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4b2a47f0-fbfa-11eb-bd7d-619dd2837feb" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Meet makes moderation easier by allowing up to 25 people to co-host]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Meet makes moderation easier by allowing up to 25 people to co-host]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's Nest Hub will display air quality levels as wildfire season continues]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google is <a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/thread/120800522/stay-in-the-know-about-the-air-around-you-on-your-nest-display?hl=en">updating</a> its Nest Hub displays with a new feature that displays the air quality index (AQI), <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/google-start-providing-air-quality-updates-nest-hub-devices"><em>Android Central</em></a> has reported.

But if you have at least $260,000 in the bank, a company called <a href="https://www.gatewaybronco.com/"><ins>Gateway Bronco</ins></a> will happily build you a vintage Bronco that’s specced like a modern EV.

Among them: a new technology that can scan the photos on users’ devices in order to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Though the change was widely praised by some lawmakers and child safety advocates, it prompted immediate pushback from many security and privacy experts, who say the update amounts to Apple walking back its commitment to putting user privacy above all else.</p><p>Apple has disputed that characterization, saying that its approach balances both privacy and the need to do more to protect children by preventing some of the most abhorrent content from spreading more widely.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>What did Apple announce?</strong></h2><p>Apple announced <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/">three separate updates</a>, all of which fall under the umbrella of “child safety.” The most significant — and the one that’s gotten the bulk of the attention — is a feature that will scan iCloud Photos for known CSAM. The feature, which is built into iCloud Photos, compares a user’s photos against a database of previously identified material. If a certain number of those images is detected, it triggers a review process. If the images are verified by human reviewers, Apple will suspend that iCloud account and report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).</p><p>Apple also previewed new “communication safety” features for the Messages app. That update enables the Messages app to detect when sexually explicit photos are sent or received by children. Importantly, this feature is only available for children who are part of a family account, and it’s up to parents to opt in.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d4ff9d40-fb96-11eb-9eef-a4cc2fb18968" alt="Apple&#39;s new Messages feature for children will send warnings when sexually explicit images are sent or received. " data-uuid="4b2162e0-2b79-3ef5-9430-3a26a1a69efa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>If parents do opt into the feature, they will be alerted if a child under the age of 13 views one of these photos. For children older than 13, the Messages app will show a warning upon receiving an explicit image, but won’t alert their parents. Though the feature is part of the Messages app, and separate from the CSAM detection, Apple has noted that the feature could still play a role in stopping child exploitation, as it could disrupt predatory messages.</p><p>Finally, Apple is updating Siri and its search capabilities so that it can “intervene” in queries about CSAM. If someone asks how to report abuse material, for example, Siri will provide links to resources to do so. If it detects that someone might be searching <em>for</em> CSAM, it will display a warning and surface resources to provide help.</p><h2><strong>When is this happening and can you opt out?</strong></h2><p>The changes will be part of iOS 15, which will roll out later this year. Users can effectively opt out by disabling iCloud Photos (instructions for doing so can be found <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204570">here</a>). However, anyone disabling iCloud Photos should keep in mind that it could affect your ability to access photos across multiple devices.</p><h2><strong>So how does this image scanning work?</strong></h2><p>Apple is far from the only company that scans photos to look for CSAM. Apple’s approach to doing so, however, is unique. The CSAM detection relies on a database of known material, maintained by NCMEC and other safety organizations. These images are “hashed” (Apple’s official name for this is NeuralHash) — a process that converts images to a numerical code that allows them to be identified, even if they are modified in some way, such as cropping or making other visual edits. As previously mentioned, CSAM detection only functions if iCloud Photos is enabled. What’s notable about Apple’s approach is that rather than matching the images once they’ve been sent to the cloud — as most cloud platforms do — Apple has moved that process to users’ devices.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/19d14270-fb97-11eb-85f3-29411f6e1ef6" alt="Apple&#39;s CSAM hashing system, NeuralHash." data-uuid="24126b46-5516-3a7b-adf1-782bc779a159"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Here’s how it works: Hashes of the known CSAM are stored on the device, and on-device photos are compared to those hashes. The iOS device then generates an encrypted “safety voucher” that’s sent to iCloud along with the image. If a device reaches a certain threshold of CSAM, Apple can decrypt the safety vouchers and conduct a manual review of those images. Apple isn’t saying what the threshold is, but has made clear a single image wouldn’t result in any action.</p><p>Apple also published a detailed technical explanation of the process <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/CSAM_Detection_Technical_Summary.pdf">here</a>.</p><h2><strong>Why is this so controversial?</strong></h2><p>Privacy advocates and security researchers have raised a number of concerns. One of these is that this feels like a major reversal for Apple, which five years ago refused the FBI’s request to unlock a phone and has put up <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/05/apple-privacy-billboard-vegas-ces/">billboards </a>stating “what happens on your iPhone stays on your iPhone.” To many, the fact that Apple created a system that can proactively check your images for illegal material and refer them to law enforcement, feels like a betrayal of that promise.</p><p>In a statement, the Electronic Frontier Foundation <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life">called it</a> “a shocking about-face for users who have relied on the company’s leadership in privacy and security.” Likewise, Facebook — which has spent years taking heat from Apple over its privacy missteps — has taken issue with the iPhone maker’s approach to CSAM. WhatsApp chief, Will Cathcart, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-head-apple-child-safety-surveillance-system-201956787.html">described it</a> as “an Apple built and operated surveillance system.”</p><p>More specifically, there are real concerns that once such a system is created, Apple could be pressured — either by law enforcement or governments — to look for other types of material. While CSAM detection is only going to be in the US to start, Apple has suggested it could  eventually expand to other countries and work with other organizations. It’s not difficult to imagine scenarios where Apple could be pressured to start looking for other types of content that’s illegal in some countries. The company’s concessions in China — where Apple reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-chinese-government-control-data-131343119.html">“ceded control”</a> of its data centers to the Chinese government — are cited as proof that the company isn’t immune to the demands of less-democratic governments.</p><p>There are other questions too. Like whether it&#39;s possible for someone to abuse this process by maliciously getting CSAM onto someone’s device in order to trigger them losing access to their iCloud account. Or whether there could be a false positive, or some other scenario that results in someone being incorrectly flagged by the company’s algorithms.</p><h2><strong>What does Apple say about this?</strong></h2><p>Apple has strongly denied that it’s degrading privacy or walking back its previous commitments. The company published a second document in which it <a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf">tries to address</a> many of these claims.</p><p>On the issue of false positives, Apple has repeatedly emphasized that it is only comparing users’ photos against a collection of known child exploitation material, so images of, say, your own children won’t trigger a report. Additionally, Apple has said that the odds of a false positive is around one in a trillion when you factor in the fact that a certain number of images must be detected in order to even trigger a review. Crucially, though, Apple is basically saying we just have to take their word on that. As Facebook’s former security chief Alex Stamos and security researcher Matthew Green wrote in a joint <em>New York Times </em>op-ed, Apple hasn’t provided outside researchers with much visibility into how all this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/opinion/apple-iphones-privacy.html">actually works</a>.</p><p>Apple <a href="http://apple.com/child-safety/pdf/Expanded_Protections_for_Children_Frequently_Asked_Questions.pdf">further</a> says that its manual review, which relies on human reviewers, would be able to detect if CSAM was on a device as the result of some kind of malicious attack.</p><p>When it comes to pressure from governments or law enforcement agencies, the company has basically said that it would refuse to cooperate with such requests. “We have faced demands to build and deploy government-mandated changes that degrade the privacy of users before, and have steadfastly refused those demands,” it writes. “We will continue to refuse them in the future. Let us be clear, this technology is limited to detecting CSAM stored in iCloud and we will not accede to any government’s request to expand it.” Although, once again, we kind of just have to take Apple at its word here.</p><h2><strong>If it’s so controversial, why is Apple doing it?</strong></h2><p>The short answer is because the company thinks this is finding the right balance between increasing child safety and protecting privacy. CSAM is illegal and, in the US, companies are obligated to report it when they find it. As a result, CSAM detection features have been baked into popular services for years. But unlike other companies, Apple hasn’t checked for CSAM in users’ photos, largely due to its stance on privacy. Unsurprisingly, this has been a major source of frustration for child safety organizations and law enforcement.</p><p>To put this in perspective, in 2019 Facebook reported 65 million instances of CSAM on its platform, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/online-child-sexual-abuse.html">according to </a><em>The New York Times</em>. Google reported 3.5 million photos and videos, while Twitter and Snap reported “more than 100,000,” Apple, on the other hand, reported 3,000 photos.</p><p>That’s not because child predators don’t use Apple services, but because Apple hasn’t been nearly as aggressive as some other platforms in looking for this material, and its privacy features have made it difficult to do so. What’s changed now is that Apple says it’s come up with a technical means of detecting collections of known CSAM in iCloud Photos libraries that still respects users’ privacy. Obviously, there’s a lot of disagreement over the details and whether any kind of detection system can truly be “private.” But Apple has calculated that the tradeoff is worth it. “If you’re storing a collection of CSAM material, yes, this is bad for you,” Apple’s head of privacy <a href="http://nytimes.com/2021/08/05/technology/apple-iphones-privacy.html">told</a><em>The New York Times</em>. “But for the rest of you, this is no different.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-csam-detection-explainer-183029927.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1d1e05c6-27fe-4bf5-9e29-0ec9d5605925</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 18:30:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628801122</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T20:45:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/90989ad0-6145-11eb-b7ad-1bcea169fe04" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/90989ad0-6145-11eb-b7ad-1bcea169fe04" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shubhashish5 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tokyo, Japan - May 23, 2020 : Apple iPhone during iOS update.

The retailer is reportedly leaning toward licensing tools from a company called <a href="https://www.behaviosec.com/">BehavioSec</a>.</p><p>&quot;The software does not rely on personally identifiable information or other static data,&quot; a <a href="https://www.behaviosec.com/documents/faq/privacy-faq/">FAQ page</a> from BehavioSec states. Instead, the company claims it uses &quot;behavioral biometrics&quot; to generate a profile of how someone types and uses their computer. Its software then utilizes that profile to verify that a hacker or imposter hasn&#39;t compromised an employee&#39;s device. BehavioSec&#39;s website lists Cisco and Deutsche Telekom as &quot;partners,&quot; suggesting Amazon wouldn&#39;t be the first company to use its software. Amazon reportedly looked at other employee monitoring solutions. However, due to &quot;challenges around collecting keystrokes data,&quot; concluded it was best to turn to more &quot;privacy-aware&quot; models like BehavioSec.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the document, Amazon claims it needs such software to combat various security threats. The company points to at least four cases where its security team identified incidents where someone posed as a service agent to obtain customer data. &quot;We have a security gap as we don&#39;t have a reliable mechanism for verifying that users are who they claim they are,&quot; the company states in the document.&nbsp;</p><p>With more of its employees working remotely due to the pandemic, it&#39;s also worried about a higher risk of &quot;data exfiltration.&quot; Amazon points to several hypothetical scenarios it wants to protect itself against, including one where a customer service employee forgets to lock their computer, and a nosy roommate steals the company&#39;s data. By 2022, it estimates the software could help it reduce imposter takeover by 100 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Maintaining the security and privacy of customer and employee data is among our highest priorities,&quot; Kelly Nantel, director of national media relations at Amazon, told Engadget. &quot;While we do not share details on the technologies we use, we continually explore and test new ways to safeguard customer-related data while also respecting the privacy of our employees. And we do this while also remaining compliant with applicable privacy laws and regulations.&quot;</p><p>While Amazon&#39;s reasons for considering BehavioSec appear to be well-intentioned, the company doesn&#39;t have the best history with employee monitoring software. A recent report from <em>CNBC</em> found Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-mentor-app-edriving-delivery-driver-tracking-surveillance-gps-194346304.html">Mentor</a> app was far too overbearing to do its intended job effectively, and it would needlessly penalize drivers for things like going over the occasional bump on the road.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-behaviosec-keystroke-software-report-175350458.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ed44a83-55ff-43c2-a2d7-7387f2b39770</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 17:53:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628790834</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T17:54:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c539f060-bd64-11eb-bff7-5286159bbbc6" width="4200" height="2800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c539f060-bd64-11eb-bff7-5286159bbbc6" width="4200" height="2800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Ryder via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEATTLE, WA - MAY 20: A sign is seen outside of an Amazon Go store at the Amazon.com Inc. headquarters on May 20, 2021 in Seattle, Washington.

As <em>Autoblog</em><a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/08/12/2022-polestar-2-price-cut-fwd-features/">reports</a>, the 2022 &quot;entry-level&quot; EV <a href="https://media.polestar.com/us/en/media/pressreleases/637040">will start</a> at $45,900 before incentives, or a cool $14,000 below the original dual-motor version&#39;s price. If you&#39;re in California, that cost after incentives could dip to a relatively low $34,900. That&#39;s no mean feat when it offers the longest range of the bunch at an EPA-estimated 265 miles.</p><p>The long-range dual-motor version starts at a lower $49,900 for 2022 ($38,900 after California incentives), with a longer 249-mile range on top of that. The catch, as you might guess, is that you&#39;ll need to add &quot;packs&quot; to get certain creature comforts, regardless of which car you&#39;re buying.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The promised mechanical heat pump, which extends range in chilly conditions, is part of a $4,000 Plus Pack that also includes a full-length glass roof, a &quot;premium&quot; interior (with Harman Kardon audio), vegan seating and cabin illumination. A $3,200 Pilot Pack  adds driver aids like adaptive cruise control, blind spot warnings and a 360-degree camera. The dual-motor-only $5,000 Performance Pack adds 20-inch alloy wheels with Brembo brakes, sport tires and gold cosmetic touches.</p><p>Deliveries of single-motor Polestar 2 units are expected by the end of 2021, while the updated dual-motor configurations should arrive in October. The pricing still makes the electric fastback more expensive than its most obvious rival, the $39,900 Tesla Model 3 in Standard Range Plus trim. However, it&#39;s now close enough that you might not mind the extra outlay if Polestar&#39;s design is more appealing — and the claimed range is finally competitive.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-single-motor-price-range-151503533.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">57af5703-12e3-4fa0-b34c-a047f6bdee23</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 12 Aug 2021 15:15:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628781203</ingested><modified>2021-08-12T15:13:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/782fb860-fb79-11eb-9f7b-1e1e5dbabf06" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/782fb860-fb79-11eb-9f7b-1e1e5dbabf06" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Polestar 2 in the forest]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Polestar 2 in the forest]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
