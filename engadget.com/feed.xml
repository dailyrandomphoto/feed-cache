Popular titles being removed from its platform include <em>FIFA 21</em>, <em>The Last of Us 2</em> and <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this week, China&#39;s National Press and Publication Administration (NPAA) regulator issued an edict limiting gaming for kids under 18 to three hours of gaming per week. They&#39;re only allowed to play now for an hour every Friday, Saturday, Sunday and on statutory holidays, marking some of the governments strictest measures since a blockade on new approvals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-21-china-resumes-game-approvals-to-the-delight-of-tencent.html">back in 2018</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new rule has a few gaping holes, notably that officials won&#39;t be able to monitor unlicensed games not officially in the system. It&#39;s difficult to see how officials would monitor offline gameplay, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it&#39;s still a big shift in JD.com&#39;s strategy, as SCMP has noted. The company announced that it would ban any game that violates China&#39;s constitution or national security laws. That also includes games that might promote vulgarity, pornography, gambling and violence. (It&#39;s hard to see how some of those games like <em>FIFA 21</em> and <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> violate those rules.)</p><p>Previously, JD.com allowed sales of certain games that straddled or crossed those lines, banning them only when they stirred up controversy. Other firms have sold banned games using code titles, changing the name of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-11-resident-evil-2-remake-is-coming-january-25th-2019.html"><em>Resident Evil 2: Remake</em></a> to <em>First Day on the Job at the Police Station: Remake</em>, for example.<em>&nbsp;</em></p><p>The new strategy may be due in to stepped up government enforcement, with Guangdong regional officials arresting 54 parallel importers in April and confiscating $11.9 million worth of smuggled consoles, according to the report.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/j-dcom-removes-super-mario-maker-2-fifa-21-and-84-other-games-in-china-124509083.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f04a3893-64fc-45c5-8114-0f4f98f7087c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 12:45:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630672124</ingested><modified>2021-09-03T12:28:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3ee99120-0cae-11ec-9df9-72d2a1173e47" width="5675" height="3922" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3ee99120-0cae-11ec-9df9-72d2a1173e47" width="5675" height="3922" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NOEL CELIS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[People look at console games at a store in Beijing on August 31, 2021, a day after China announced a drastic cut to children's online gaming time to just three hours a week in the latest move in a broad crackdown on tech giants.

In other words, it can tell how well your lungs are delivering oxygenated blood throughout your body. However, we were more impressed with its under-the-hood upgrades, as we mentioned in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">review</a> where we gave it a score of 89.</p><p>The model uses Apple&#39;s new S6 chip, resulting in a zippier performance compared to its predecessors. Apps launch more quickly and swiping through watchfaces feel faster, as well. It&#39;s also more energy efficient, which translates to longer battery life, and charges faster than the previous Watch generation. In addition, the device has all the features that come with watchOS 7, including a handwashing timer and a sleep tracker.</p><p>Only the 40mm GPS-only Product Red version is on sale at the moment, and you can&#39;t get the other colors for the same price. Product Red versions of Apple&#39;s devices are special, though, because the tech giant has been giving proceeds from their sales to the Global Fund&#39;s HIV/AIDS programs for over a decade now. The initiative&#39;s goal shifted last year due to the pandemic, and Apple announced that it will be donating &quot;100 percent of eligible proceeds&quot; from Product Red purchases to the Global Fund&#39;s COVID‑19 response efforts until December 30th, 2021.</p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals">@EngadgetDeals</a> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-249-120556593.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af8d9e23-8def-458a-ad32-d7296423d4ae</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 12:05:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630673031</ingested><modified>2021-09-03T12:44:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2ac1f390-0c9f-11ec-943f-b5f4cf2b4c66" width="1600" height="1061" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2ac1f390-0c9f-11ec-943f-b5f4cf2b4c66" width="1600" height="1061" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Dining in Gotham City]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Among all the themed restaurants and dining experiences in the world, Park Row, a new dining venture in London, tries to keep things a little classier than the rest.

According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-close-to-launching-its-own-tv-in-the-us-2021-9"><em>Insider</em></a>, the e-commerce giant is planning to launch its own TVs in the US as soon as October, just in time for the holiday shopping season. The project has reportedly been in development for almost two years by teams from Amazon Devices and Lab126, the R&amp;D division responsible for designing the company&#39;s products that include the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kindle-display-cover-212808686.html">Kindle</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-12-amazon-higher-quality-echo-speaker-vesta-robot.html">Echo</a> speakers.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Insider</em> says, however, that the models expected to be launched in October were designed and manufactured by third parties like TCL. Amazon&#39;s in-house team is apparently working on a separate TV, though it&#39;s unclear if that will also be released in the US in the coming months. As for the third-party-made TVs, <em>Insider</em> says they&#39;re going to be powered by Alexa, as you&#39;d expect from Amazon-branded hardware. The publication didn&#39;t say, however, if they will also run the company&#39;s Fire TV software.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon already sells TVs running Fire TV, but they still carry their manufacturers&#39; brands. These upcoming TVs will have Amazon branding even if they&#39;re made by third-party companies, similar to the AmazonBasics TVs the e-commerce giant sells in India. If you&#39;ll recall, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-india-231557259.html">released</a> a 55-inch and a 50-inch model under the AmazonBasics brand in the country last year. The models planned for a US release will reportedly be in the range of 55 to 75 inches, though we&#39;ll have to wait for more information to find out whether they&#39;re also lower-cost models like the TVs released in India.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-branded-tv-us-051047163.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bf8f9117-1c1a-40e6-85b0-0cf21153c749</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 05:10:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630645879</ingested><modified>2021-09-03T05:11:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/55651820-0c6d-11ec-97af-569031d68535" width="1240" height="781" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/55651820-0c6d-11ec-97af-569031d68535" width="1240" height="781" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Marvel's Midnight Suns' is a card-based tactical RPG]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Firaxis <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-midnight-suns-release-date-trailer-191236120.html"><ins>announced </ins><em><ins>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</ins></em></a> last week, the studio’s Jake Solomon promised the game would share “zero mechanics” with XCOM, but said little else about how its gameplay systems would work.

That’s still a lot of cash to put down to get the tonality and micro-contrasts you can only find on a medium format camera, but it’s significantly less than the $5,999 and $5,499 Fujifilm sells the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-gfx-100s-review-140025104.html"><ins>GFX 100S</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-19-fujifilm-gfx-50s-price.html"><ins>GFX 50S</ins></a> for at the moment.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/415a38e0-0c33-11ec-bf5f-f56d77f4af86" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Fujifilm GFX 50S II" data-uuid="7a7ca1ff-28c2-3153-bdc3-1ec3a099dd65"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fujifilm</div></figure><p>Headline features of the GFX 50S II include a 51.4-megapixel sensor that’s 1.7 times larger than what you’ll find on a full-frame camera like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-08-sony-a7-iii-review-peerless-full-frame-camera.html"><ins>Sony A7 III</ins></a>, five-axis in-body stabilization Fujifilm claims provides up to 6.5-stops of shake reduction and a body that weighs just under two pounds. According to Fujifilm, the GFX 50S II also features faster and more accurate autofocus than its predecessor thanks to the inclusion of its latest X-Processor 4.

In the case of the GFX 50S II, it allows you to combine 16 RAW captures into a 200-megapixel DNG file. One other notable feature is the 1.8-inch monochrome display on the top of the camera you can glance at to see your current capture settings. In addition to selling the camera on its own, Fujifilm will bundle the GFX 50S II with a new 35-70mm kit lens for $4,499.

The automaker has <a href="https://media.audiusa.com/en-us/releases/489">introduced</a> a Grandsphere concept electric sedan that uses Level 4 self-driving (full autonomy in limited conditions) to help you avoid driving &quot;whenever possible&quot; — this is a luxurious living room that just happens to let you take the wheel.</p><p>Invoke the driverless mode and the Grandsphere will &#39;reduce&#39; the wheel and pedals to make it clear you&#39;re supposed to relax. The displays are really projections on wooden surfaces that adapt based on whether or not you&#39;re driving — you can watch media or participate in video conferences. While Audi&#39;s familiar MMI controls are available in an upright seating position, you can use eye tracking and gestures to navigate the infotainment system while you&#39;re reclining. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-audi-backseat-vr-disney-marvel.html">VR glasses</a> in the armrests help you immerse yourself in entertainment during your commute.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c1f33db0-0c30-11ec-bfdf-661b866bec13" style="height:900;width:1600;" alt="Audi Grandsphere concept EV interior" data-uuid="a4366569-87e6-3a20-83a7-eaa3bbd2fb8c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Audi</div></figure><p>Audi is promising extensive personalization that would refine the interior as you step in, ranging from basics like climate control through to the media services you last used. The car would even display the news you were reading on your phone, according to the company.</p><p>The design itself is a large &quot;2+2&quot; seater with a grand tourer-like profile but a wheelbase longer than the stretched version of the A8. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-first-drive-video-220117807.html">Mercedes&#39; EQS</a>, you won&#39;t be hurting for range — Audi is claiming 466 miles of driving with the 120kWh battery. An 800-volt charging architecture can give you 186 miles of driving in ten minutes, and bring the Grandsphere from a five percent charge to 80 percent in 25 minutes. It&#39;s not the fastest vehicle with a 0-62MPH time of &quot;just over&quot; four seconds, but you clearly wouldn&#39;t buy this to win drag races.</p><p>Not that you&#39;ll likely buy this car in the first place. As with the Skysphere and the upcoming Urbansphere concept, this is more to illustrate Audi&#39;s vision of its autonomous EV future. At least some of the technologies (such as that news display) are more what Audi aspires to build than something you could expect any time soon. It won&#39;t be shocking if some of the features or design cues make their way into production cars, however, and there&#39;s little doubt that many car brands will have to rethink their designs when manual driving becomes more of an exception than the rule.</p><div id="d870cc90101b4be6807e2df9f315cdf7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JoKMs7cih_k?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/audi-grandsphere-concept-self-driving-ev-211947324.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">21cf83b8-f58d-49ca-99e1-c874b8555a71</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 21:19:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630617590</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T21:20:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/409f9510-0c2b-11ec-b77d-30bd58b24473" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/409f9510-0c2b-11ec-b77d-30bd58b24473" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Audi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Audi Grandsphere self-driving concept EV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Audi Grandsphere self-driving concept EV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FAA grounds Virgin Galactic space flights during anomaly investigation (updated)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Virgin Galactic is having a particularly bad day. <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-bars-virgin-galactic-rocket-plane-flights-pending-mishap-probe-2021-09-02/">reports</a> the Federal Aviation Administration has barred Virgin from flying SpaceShipTwo while the agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-probe-anomaly-richard-branson-virgin-galactic-092123771.html">investigates an anomaly</a> in the descent of Richard Branson&#39;s spaceflight.

We take this seriously and are currently addressing the causes of the issue and determining how to prevent this from occurring on future missions. Although the flight’s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico. At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory, and at no time did the ship travel above any population centers or cause a hazard to the public. FAA representatives were present in our control room during the flight and in post-flight debriefs.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We have been working closely with the FAA to support a thorough review and timely resolution of this issue.</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/faa-bars-virgin-galactic-spaceflights-203534520.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">04bccd0c-cac7-4e52-a556-acc17cffc55f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 20:35:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630617791</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T21:23:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6c3ee560-0c24-11ec-87e7-afec10069ceb" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6c3ee560-0c24-11ec-87e7-afec10069ceb" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PATRICK T.

This actually contradicts what Sony said when the PS5 was officially priced and given a release date last year: <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/09/16/playstation-5-launches-in-november-starting-at-399-for-ps5-digital-edition-and-499-for-ps5-with-ultra-hd-blu-ray-disc-drive/">Sony&#39;s own blog post</a> clearly states that some PS5 games, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-sony-playstation-4-215249430.html">including Horizon Forbidden West</a><em>, </em>would also be released on the PS4 with free upgrades to the PS5 version later.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with most AAA games these days, the PS4 versions costs $60 and the PS5 $70. There are also special edition steelbook version for both consoles that also include a mini art book and digital copy of the soundtrack for $10 more.</p><div id="9831fa8153ea4c7cadd4550de69f26c2"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lj_kC8gxWU4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>If you&#39;re really not sure which console to buy for, there&#39;s a digital deluxe edition that might be the way to go. For $80 (the same as the PS5 steelbook version), you&#39;ll get the game on both PS4 and PS5. It also comes with a number of digital goodies including the art book, soundtrack, a digital comic and some in-game outfits and items. One unlock we haven&#39;t heard of before is for the game&#39;s photo mode; you&#39;ll unlock special face paint and a unique pose for Aloy.</p><p>As with other popular AAA titles, there are a couple of lavish and expensive editions for hardcore fans (like the author of this post). The highlight of the $200 Collector&#39;s Edition is a seemingly massive statue of the game&#39;s Tremortusk enemy alongside a much smaller statue of Aloy. It also includes the same physical art book and steelbook display case that comes with the special editions, plus all the digital gear included with the deluxe edition.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/49864e10-0c23-11ec-bf9b-ed4057da83c7" alt="Horizon Forbidden West Regalla edition" data-uuid="533452d6-7984-3346-9da4-683af15f0492"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The $260 &quot;Regalla&quot; edition (so named for an enemy faction in the new game) steps things up with an even more detailed statue that includes special armor and enemy warriors riding the Tremortusk. It also includes two artwork cards, a replica of Aloy&#39;s Focus, a canvas map and two replicas of &quot;Strike&quot; pieces from the game. Strike is apparently a type of board game that the characters in <em>Horizon Forbidden West </em>play; we&#39;ll have to learn more about them later.</p><p>Both of these massive editions come with the game for both PS4 and PS5 — but, they do <em>not</em> include the game on disc. Instead, you&#39;ll receive a download card. It makes some degree of sense, given that Sony now sells a PS5 with no disc drive,  but it&#39;s definitely a bummer for people who don&#39;t want to have to wait for what will surely be a massive game download.&nbsp;</p><p>Confused yet? Let&#39;s make it simple: If you want both PS4 and PS5 versions, you&#39;ll need to spend $80 on the digital deluxe edition, which is not a bad idea considering you get the two game versions plus a bunch of digital goodies for only 10 bucks more than the standard PS5 edition. The other option is buying the pricey Collector&#39;s or Regalla editions. But if you&#39;re set on buying a disc, you&#39;ll have to stick with whatever console you pick when you buy it, as there are no plans to offer an upgrade path to the PS5.</p><p>You can see and pre-order all the various editions <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">here</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-ps5-pre-order-details-193232855.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed9f2fb0-166b-42cf-b491-3bd22501f89e</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 19:32:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630611520</ingested><modified>2021-09-03T06:03:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Books & Publishing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9e612cc0-0c23-11ec-bd9e-8115b1b8035c" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9e612cc0-0c23-11ec-bd9e-8115b1b8035c" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[There&#39;s no way to upgrade &#39;Horizon Forbidden West&#39; from PS4 to PS5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter will soon let you tip other users with bitcoin]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ever see a real good tweet that makes you stop and think &quot;that amused or informed me to the extent I want to give that person a monetary tip&quot;? <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tip-jar-201442453.html"><ins>Twitter&#39;s Tip Jar</ins></a> has let users do just that for the last few months.

The chip inside the wearable won&#39;t be as powerful as Apple&#39;s in-house chips and will lack the Neural Engine used to accelerate AI tasks. It&#39;ll be made on a 5-nanometer process that will seem old by the time the headset is available, according to one contact.</p><p>The chip will reportedly have a CPU and GPU, leaving open the possibility for a weaker stand-alone mode like you see with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Oculus Quest 2</a>. However, the hardware is supposedly optimized for processing and transmitting the headset&#39;s camera imagery over a wireless link, with a focus on battery life. Apple is rumored to be using &quot;ultrahigh-resolution&quot; (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-price-specs-rumor-145412503.html">possibly 8K</a> per eye) displays, with cameras to match.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The headset may still be a long way off. Apple supposedly just completed &quot;tape-out&quot; (that is, completed the physical design) for the main chip, display driver and image sensor. Trial production will take a while, let alone the mass production needed for a shipping product.</p><p><em>Information</em> had heard the device might not be ready until 2022 at best, and might launch later. It&#39;s believed to be aimed at developers and creators with a potential price around $3,000. Any truly consumer-oriented hardware might have to wait until a possible set of AR glasses launching in 2023 or later.</p><p>Apple declined to comment.

If you’re Roland Emmerich, the answer is, quite simply, to drop the Moon on the planet.

According to the film’s official synopsis, a “mysterious force” is what sets the Moon on its collision course with Earth. It’s up to a NASA executive, former astronaut and conspiracy theorist — played by Halle Berry, Patrick Wilson and John Bradley, respectively — to save the world. “These unlikely heroes will mount an impossible last-ditch mission into space, leaving behind everyone they love, only to find out that our Moon is not what we think it is,” the film’s official summary says.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I’ll say it now. I hope it’s not aliens that are behind everything.

It features AMD&#39;s latest processor, NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 30-series GPUs, and a responsive 14-inch display, but it wraps all of that together in a sub-four-pound package. What&#39;s not to love? While Razer&#39;s 13-inch Blade Stealth is even lighter, I&#39;ve always found it to be woefully underpowered and dramatically overpriced. But the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Blade 14" href="https://fave.co/3t7TNFi">Blade 14</a> represents what Razer does best: delivering powerful hardware that feels more polished than the competition.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="de99fac5-4390-4b37-a839-85db110314d7"/><p>Imagine a shrunken-down version of the Blade 15, and you&#39;ve pretty much got the 14-inch. It has the same sleek black aluminum case, and a minimalist aesthetic that resembles Apple&#39;s MacBook Pro more than a typical gaming laptop. That, of course, has been Razer&#39;s major accomplishment over the last few years: Its computers are still the closest Windows users can get to Apple&#39;s polished hardware. The only major feature that screams &quot;gaming laptop&quot; is the Blade 14&#39;s RGB LED keyboard, which allows every key to display its own color (something you can also turn off easily, too).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like most 14-inch gaming laptops these days, the Blade 14&#39;s biggest selling point is that it&#39;s lighter than most 15-inch notebooks. Here&#39;s where Razer&#39;s own innovations start to work against it, though. The Blade 15 currently weighs around 4.4 pounds, whereas the 14 clocks in at 3.9 pounds. That&#39;s only a half-pound difference, something that could be noticeable if you were comparing these laptops in each hand, but less so in normal usage. The Blade 14 would have seemed more impressive when the 15-inch model was upwards of 4.6 pounds, but now it&#39;s actually a bit hefty compared to competitors like the 3.5-pound ASUS Zephyrus G14.</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time that Razer has had a 14-inch laptop either, which takes some of the luster away from the Blade 14. The last model dropped around three years ago, toting a 7th-gen Intel CPU and weak NVIDIA GTX 1650 graphics. What makes this new version stand out is under the hood. It&#39;s the first time Razer has used an AMD processor — every Blade 15 comes with the powerful Ryzen 9 5900HX — and it also has NVIDIA&#39;s fastest RTX 30 graphics.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/433cc310-0c08-11ec-b24f-c9f4612ef9dd" alt="Razer Blade 14" data-uuid="e10e0957-cbed-3c3e-823d-23e70437cd12"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Still, it&#39;s worth noting even those graphics cards are constrained by the Blade 14&#39;s size. NVIDIA lets every PC maker tweak the wattage of their GPUs, which is helpful for dealing with thermal constraints, but that also means performance can vary wildly. Basically, not every RTX 3080 is created equal, especially when it comes to gaming laptops. Keep that caveat in mind, because it&#39;ll explain some of the performance benchmarks I ended up seeing.</p><p>Our review unit was the most expensive configuration, a $2,800 build with the Ryzen 9 5900HX, RTX 3080, 16GB of fixed RAM, 1TB SSD, and a quad HD 165Hz display Given that caliber hardware, the Blade 14 had no troubling handling demanding games and torturous benchmarks. In <em>Destiny 2</em>, reached up to 120fps while playing in 1,440p with maxed-out settings. It also looked smooth on the laptop&#39;s 14-inch screen, with excellent color reproduction and solid brightness. Ray tracing performance was also solid; I was able to see between 60 and 70fps in <em>Control </em>while playing in 1,440p with maxed graphics, DLSS and medium ray tracing.<br></p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td><td><p>ATTO (top reads/writes)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Razer Blade 14 (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, NVIDIA RTX 3080)</p></td><td><p>6,551</p></td><td><p>4,418</p></td><td><p>1,443/7,226</p></td><td><p>3 Gb/s / 2GB/s </p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX, AMD Radeon RX 6800M)</p></td><td><p>6,992</p></td><td><p>5,189</p></td><td><p>1,457/7,691</p></td><td><p>2.8 GB/s / 1.5 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus G15 (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>6,881</p></td><td><p>4,530</p></td><td><p>1,426/7,267</p></td><td><p>3.3 GB/s / 2.85 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MSI GS66 Stealth (2021, Intel i7-10870H, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,369</p></td><td><p>4,538</p></td><td><p>1,247/6,505</p></td><td><p>3.1 GB/s / 2.9 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus G14 (AMD Ryzen 9 4900HS, NVIDIA RTX 2060 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,436</p></td><td><p>2,725</p></td><td><p>1,189/7,705</p></td><td><p>1.7 GB/s / 1.67 GB/s</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p></p><p>Still, I definitely noticed the compromises Razer had to make to squeeze the RTX 3080 into such a small case. It was slower than the larger Lenovo Legion 5 Pro, equipped with an RTX 3070 GPU, in all of our 3DMark tests and Geekbench 5&#39;s compute benchmark. Clearly, Lenovo was able to squeeze out more performance from what&#39;s supposed to be a slower GPU. Compared to the ASUS Zephyrus G15, which has a Ryzen 9 5900HS and an RTX 3080, the Blade 15 lags behind slightly in all of our 3D benchmarks.</p><p>I also noticed that the Blade 14 could get toasty, with its CPU reaching up to 94 degrees Celsius when I really stressed it out. It&#39;s rare for me to see processors going beyond 85 Celsius in gaming notebooks today, so that was particularly surprising. There were times when the bottom of the Blade 14 felt too hot to touch. I was glad that the GPU generally stayed below 84 Celsius under load, which is more in line with competitors. Despite running so hot, it lasted 10 hours and 50 minutes in our battery benchmark. That’s mainly for productivity tasks, though. Expect it to last a lot less if you’re gaming unplugged.</p><section data-eng-breakout="eaff90eae90646688c716974b9a75fb3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/433e22a0-0c08-11ec-b8fe-3f00575f5905" alt="Razer Blade 14"></section><p>The Blade 14&#39;s case size also has implications for its keyboard. While it looks and feels just like Razer&#39;s existing laptop designs, with a satisfying amount of key travel and responsiveness, the layout is far more cramped than the Blade 15. That led to a bit of finger pain after extended <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>Overwatch </em>sessions. Maybe I&#39;m just becoming less dexterous in my older age, but I think that alone could be a dealbreaker for some gamers. You&#39;re going to be hitting those WASD keys quite a bit in shooters, after all.</p><p>Port-wise, the Blade 14 crams in most of what you&#39;d want: two USB-C 3.2 connections with charging; two USB 3.2 Type A sockets; a full-sized HDMI port; a headphone jack; and a custom power cable. It&#39;s definitely nice to be able to charge up using a normal USB-C cable, but those won&#39;t be powerful enough to juice up while gaming. Thankfully, the Blade 14&#39;s bundled power adapter is relatively small, unlike the bricks that gaming laptops used to come with.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/433dd481-0c08-11ec-bb7a-0004be265470" alt="Razer Blade 14" data-uuid="2de92852-3418-33ed-b54b-064e4b7bbfe4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As usual, I would have liked to see an SD card reader, but that&#39;s just another reason to consider the larger Razer notebooks. Similarly, the Blade 14 doesn&#39;t have upgradable RAM, which means you&#39;re stuck with the 16GB of memory it comes with. You can upgrade the NVMe SSD, but you&#39;ll be limited to 2TB. The Blade 15 and 17, meanwhile, let you add more RAM and up to two NVMe SSDs.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Blade 14 starts at $1,800" href="https://fave.co/3t7TNFi">Blade 14 starts at $1,800</a> with an RTX 3060 and a 1080p 144Hz screen. Given that price point, I&#39;d recommend the Blade 15 for most shoppers. You&#39;d get a larger screen, more customizable and faster hardware, as well as fewer thermal restrictions. And when it comes to 14-inch competition, the ASUS Zephyrus G14 is another solid choice (though I&#39;d give Razer the upper hand when it comes to long-term reliability).</p><p>Still, there’s a lot to love about the Blade 14. More so than the overpriced Blade Stealth 13, this new model is a light laptop that&#39;ll satisfy most of your hardware demands. So if you&#39;re in love with the idea of a sub-four-pound Blade, and don&#39;t mind the compromises involved, then go with the gaming gods.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-review-amd-ryzen-173003809.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">779af9a9-1ada-4c0f-ae8f-963eb8ff75a1</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 17:30:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630606031</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T18:07:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f5250d30-0c17-11ec-bb9d-b01dad4d87c7" width="2000" height="1233" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f5250d30-0c17-11ec-bb9d-b01dad4d87c7" width="2000" height="1233" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Razer Blade 14]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer Blade 14]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook expands access to licensed music for game streams]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/facebook%20gaming">Facebook Gaming</a> is letting more creators play licensed music in the background while streaming gameplay.
