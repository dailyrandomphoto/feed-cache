Holmes faces up to 20 years in prison for defrauding investors in her blood testing startup. The verdict comes after a months-long trial, and more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-15-elizabeth-holmes-steps-down-ceo-theranos.html"><ins>three years</ins></a> after she was first charged and forced to step down as CEO in 2018.</p><p>During the trial, Holmes’ lawyers tried to portray her as a young and inexperienced entrepreneur. “Elizabeth Holmes worked herself to the bone for 15 years trying to make lab testing more affordable,” one of Holmes’ attorneys said in <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/elizabeth-holmes-case-opening-arguments-121138767.html"><ins>opening arguments</ins></a>. “She failed … but failure is not a crime.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Holmes, who <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/elizabeth-holmes-trial-testimony.html"><ins>testified</ins></a> during the trial, said she hadn’t intended to mislead the public or investors, and had been advised to protect the company’s “trade secrets.” As <em>The New York Times </em>pointed out, she “spent much of her testimony arguing that others at Theranos were responsible for the company’s shortcomings.”</p><p>The prosecution alleged that Holmes knew about serious flaws in the company’s technology and hid the issues from investors. Former patients who had received inaccurate blood tests also testified, including an Arizona woman who received an incorrect result for an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/17/theranos-patient-says-blood-test-came-back-with-false-positive-for-hiv.html"><ins>HIV test</ins></a>, and a woman who was misdiagnosed with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/21/theranos-test-gave-false-miscarriage-diagnosis-witness-testifies.html"><ins>a miscarriage</ins></a>.</p><p>Holmes’ story has been a source of widespread fascination even for those outside of Silicon Valley. At its peak, Theranos was valued at more than $9 billion, and had a board of directors filled with former high-ranking <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/theranos-former-board-members-henry-kissinger-george-shultz-james-mattis-2019-3"><ins>government officials</ins></a>, including two former Secretaries of State, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz. Holmes, who had dropped out of Stanford to start the company, regularly appeared on <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/10/26/11620036/theranos-ceo-elizabeth-holmess-five-best-cover-story-appearances"><ins>magazine covers</ins></a> and was often compared to Steve Jobs and other iconic founders. (Holmes herself was reportedly infatuated with Jobs and adopted his signature <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/16/fashion/elizabeth-holmes-black-turtleneck-theranos.html"><ins>black turtlenecks</ins></a>.)</p><p>Former <em>Wall Street Journal</em> reporter John Carreyrou was the first to report on issues with Theranos’ technology in 2015, and his coverage prompted multiple investigations and lawsuits that ultimately resulted in criminal charges for Holmes and former COO Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani. (Balwani’s trial is scheduled to begin <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-14/balwani-s-theranos-fraud-trial-delayed-as-holmes-fight-drags-on"><ins>in February</ins></a>.)</p><p>Since then, there has been no shortage of pop culture depictions of Holmes. After Carreyrou’s best seller, <em>Bad Blood</em>, there was an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-09-the-inventor-hbo-theranos.html"><ins>HBO documentary</ins></a> and several podcasts about Theranos’ rise and ultimate downfall. Hulu is set to debut a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hulu-theranos-series-the-dropout-march-3-222307396.html"><ins>new miniseries</ins></a> about the saga, with Amanda Seyfried starring as Holmes, in March. And Apple recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-theranos-elizabeth-holmes-movie-200124528.html"><ins>nabbed</ins></a> the Jennifer Lawrence-led film adaptation of <em>Bad Blood</em>.</p><p><em>Developing…</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-verdict-guilty-fraud-001725594.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">66c4f3e6-b097-45cb-8eaf-d81405c6c03e</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 00:17:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641255447</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T00:17:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9c9a04b0-09db-11ec-bf5b-3b65dc6250b6" width="2802" height="1930" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9c9a04b0-09db-11ec-bf5b-3b65dc6250b6" width="2802" height="1930" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Elizabeth Holmes, founder and former CEO of Theranos, arrives for motion hearing on Monday, November 4, 2019, at the U.S. District Court House inside Robert F.

The Cypress Hero Backpack has a built-in location tracker that could help its rightful owner find it through the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-find-my-network-tracking-upgrades-032304589.html">Find My network</a> if it goes missing. Conversely, if you misplace your iPhone, you can press a button on the backpack to ping your phone, as long as you&#39;ve set things up in the Targus app.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/targus/">Targus</a> says the tracker is &quot;highly integrated&quot; into the backpack, which should offer some additional anti-theft protection. You can set up geofencing alerts, so if the backpack moves out of a certain area, you&#39;ll receive an alert. The tracker also has a built-in sound alert (which will likely be around as loud as an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTag</a>) that you can trigger remotely.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tracker has a replaceable battery that you can top up via USB, though Targus says it will run for around a year before you need to recharge it. Targus crafted the backpack with sustainability in mind, as it&#39;s made with 26 recycled water bottles. The Cypress Hero Backpack, which has an IPX3 water resistance rating, should be available sometime in the spring or summer. It costs $150.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/3f595fb0-6810-11ec-afcf-ca235cdcce81" alt="Targus DOCK720 docking station." data-uuid="d3ffb672-3fd8-3073-9817-1868767b1aef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Targus</div></figure><p>On top of that, Targus announced the DOCK720, a docking station that supports a single 8K monitor or up to four 4K monitors. The company says it&#39;s the &quot;first biometric device and docking solution in one&quot; — in other words, it has a fingerprint reader. You can expect an array of ports too, including USB-A, USB-C, Ethernet, HDMI and a combo audio jack. The dock will be available this month for $443.</p><p>The Targus Docking Display, meanwhile, is a 24-inch 1080p LCD monitor with a built-in 2MP webcam, microphone, speakers and USB-C docking station. You can daisy chain it to a second monitor and power both displays from your computer. The Docking Display will ship in February. The primary monitor costs $400 and the secondary monitor (which doesn&#39;t have a webcam) is $180.</p><p>In addition, Targus is expanding its lineup of antimicrobial products, which now includes backpacks, shoulder bags and protective sleeves for laptops. The company claims its DefenseGuard Antimicrobial Protection effectively prevents the growth of 99.9% of germ-causing microorganisms.</p><p>It will also release the UV-C LED Disinfection Light next month after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/targus-uv-light-antimicrobial-backpack-150036748.html">debuting it at CES 2021</a>. For five minutes every hour, the $300 device will bathe a surface (or, more likely, a keyboard and mouse) in ultraviolet light to effectively kill 99 percent of pathogens.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/targus-smart-backpack-apple-find-my-tracker-docking-station-monitor-disinfection-light-230012642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5a8b9f0f-4bca-420b-bcc1-3c3d78445d19</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 23:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221478</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:51:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0cd19530-6810-11ec-bd7d-72b1f685ba8e" width="1650" height="1275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0cd19530-6810-11ec-bd7d-72b1f685ba8e" width="1650" height="1275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Targus]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Targus Cypress Hero Backpack with a built-in location tracker.

One of the limitations of those devices is that they typically only include one monitoring function. In the long run, that’s something that can cost you extra money if you move and end up with too many of one sensor and not enough of another. Security camera maker <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Arlo" href="https://fave.co/3EPKaj4">Arlo</a> may have an elegant solution for that problem.</p><p>At CES 2022, the company introduced a security system that includes an all-in-one multi-sensor with eight monitoring functions. It can detect motion (including door and window openings), water leaks, light and temperature changes, as well as sounds made by T3 and T4 smoke alarms. Each sensor is about an inch wide and connects to a modular hub that includes a backlit keypad and NFC connectivity so that you can use your phone to activate and disarm the system. The hub is also compatible with Arlo’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">various security cameras</a> and its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Secure subscription service" href="https://fave.co/3CQaola">Secure subscription service</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Arlo Security System will go on sale sometime in the first half of 2022, according to a statement the company shared with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022"><em>The Verge</em></a>. It promised to disclose more information, including details on pricing, closer to release. The company didn’t have anything to say about the Security System’s smart home integrations today, but it did announce that it will support the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chip-rebrand-matter-221410229.html">Matter</a> standard moving forward.

In 2021, Norwegian dealerships sold 176,276 cars, 65 percent of which were EVs. That’s an 11 percentage point increase from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/evs-outsell-traditional-engines-in-norway-for-all-of-2020-115746618.html">year prior</a> when they accounted for 54 percent of all new car sales.&nbsp;</p><p>The Tesla Model 3 was the most popular choice among new buyers followed by Toyota’s hybrid RAV4, the only car with an internal combustion engine to make the country’s top-ten best-selling list.

As in 2020, much of what’s driving EV adoption in Norway is the country’s generous subsidies. Car buyers don’t have to pay taxes imposed on traditional internal combustion engine vehicles when they buy an EV. In 2021, the country’s federal government missed out on approximately $3.41 billion in tax revenue to push forward on its plan to end all gasoline-powered car sales by 2025.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/evs-outsell-gas-cars-norway-2021-185544342.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b4a1c81a-151f-4b64-93d5-7523b1fa1fe6</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 18:55:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238950</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:42:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/80abe180-2843-11eb-af43-631e2ff69ad6" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/80abe180-2843-11eb-af43-631e2ff69ad6" width="1920" height="1097" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz boasts 620-mile range for its latest EV concept]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="851681933b794e2c93d36a9c065d33ce"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEVZWNbn7ys?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Mercedes-Benz/">Mercedes-Benz</a> has <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-211879a94f6a1a0ff764674cdc0a8630-vision-eqxx-taking-electric-range-and-efficiency-to-an-entirely-new-level">unveiled</a> a concept electric vehicle it claims would be able to run for more than 620 miles before needing to recharge.

The automaker says that, with a drag coefficient of cd 0.17, the EV is more aerodynamic than a football (which has a cd of 0.18 to 0.2). What&#39;s more, Mercedes claims that 95 percent of battery energy is directed to the wheels.</p><p>Teams from Mercedes&#39; research and development centers worked with its Formula 1 and Formula E engineers on the concept.

The most intriguing of them is a new version of the Chromebook Spin 513 (pictured above), one of Acer&#39;s mid-range options. While the company already sells a few different configurations of the Spin 513, this new model has a somewhat unusual processor on board. It&#39;s using MediaTek&#39;s eight-core Kompanio 1380 processor, coupled with up to 8GB of RAM and up to 128GB of storage. In the past, I&#39;ve been reluctant to recommend Chromebooks without Intel processors, but I won&#39;t write this one off without testing it first.&nbsp;</p><p>Assuming the processor holds up, there are some other things to like about the Chromebook Spin 513. This year&#39;s model has a 13.5-inch touchscreen with a 2,256 x 1,504 resolution; that&#39;s a 3:2 aspect ratio like the Chromebook Spin 713 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html">I reviewed last year</a>. The Spin 713 is an expensive Chromebook at $699, but the Spin 513 is priced at $599. That&#39;s not cheap, but I&#39;m glad to see Acer put this 3:2 display on a less expensive option. As the name suggests, the Flip 513 has a 360-degree hinge so the laptop can be flipped around into tablet mode as well as &quot;tent&quot; mode for watching video. Unfortunately, we&#39;ll have to wait until June for this laptop to go on sale.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The other two new Acer Chromebooks are budget options, both priced at $299. The 2022 Chromebook 315 is a 15.6-inch laptop, and its large 1080p panel (touchscreen optional) is the main selling point here. Other specs are pretty standard for this price range: Intel Celeron or Pentium Silver processors, up to 8GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage and about 10 hours of battery life. The Chromebook 314, on the other hand, is essentially the same as the 315, it just has a smaller, 14-inch 1080p screen. The Chromebook 315 will be on sale this month in the US, but the 314 won&#39;t be available until June.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-513-2022-price-specs-170038270.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8cb4a04a-91ad-4dd4-995e-2035b2bc5aad</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238438</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:34:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10dcd950-6ca7-11ec-a6ff-ee7845cdd537" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10dcd950-6ca7-11ec-a6ff-ee7845cdd537" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Acer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 513 (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Kohler's fog-emitting smart 'Stillness Bath' is yours for $8,000]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/kohler/"><ins>Kohler</ins></a> has revealed when you&#39;ll be able to snag the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-of-ces-2021-winners-215307033.html"><ins>Stillness Bath</ins></a> it unveiled at CES 2021, as well as a number of other smart home products.

They also use pressure sensing to look for crystals forming in pipes, so they can alert users before pipes freeze and burst.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4002acc0-6caa-11ec-8fff-4a9437db4297" style="height:2004;width:3000;" alt="Kohler H2Wise water monitoring system connected to pipes" data-uuid="47464976-4d3e-3f64-81fe-172e74a794c6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kohler</div></figure><p>The DIY version (H2Wise) can be installed under a single sink, while the pro model, H2Wise+, is attached to the home&#39;s main valve and can shut off water throughout the residence if it detects a leak. As well as the Kohler app, you can connect the units to voice assistants. The DIY model costs approximately $400, and Kohler says the pro version (which can also be used outdoors) will be an estimated $666.70.</p><p>Among the other products Kohler will release this year is the Power Reserve Energy Storage System, which can pair with solar panel systems to store energy they produce. The battery can act as a backup for outages or to power the home using stored solar energy and reduce dependence on utility power. You can also prioritize the use of stored energy during peak usage times to lower the cost of your utility bills.</p><p>There could be a benefit for homes that don&#39;t have solar panels, as the system can store energy from the power grid at times of lower electricity usage. Kohler Power Reserve will start at around $13,325 for a system with a 10 kWh battery capacity, though you can have up to 20 kWh.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kohler-stillness-bath-pricing-availability-hands-free-faucet-home-energy-storage-155808475.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">44bdb3fd-508c-4857-a056-b5a56b6ee821</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:58:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641238381</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T19:33:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e1033780-6ca9-11ec-977e-5e4c54461631" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e1033780-6ca9-11ec-977e-5e4c54461631" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kohler]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kohler's Stillness Bath takes inspiration from Japanese forest bathing and aims to replicate a spa experience with the help of light, fog, and aromas.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Kohler Stillness Bath]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTag is the cheapest it's ever been at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s AirTags can be a good way to keep track of that new backpack or wallet you were gifted during the holidays, and now you can grab one of the trackers for less. Amazon has a single <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirTag" href="https://amzn.to/3zoVxNQ">AirTag</a> for $24, which is $5 less than usual and a new record-low. The only time we&#39;ve seen AirTags for less than this was during a Woot sale on a four-pack. This, however, is the best price we&#39;ve seen if you want just one of the trackers — and while it&#39;s a relatively small discount, it&#39;s a good deal on an accessory that rarely goes on sale.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3zoVxNQ" id="e0c890e637b1452882acc1322a6ad312" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy AirTag at Amazon - $24</a><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> are designed to work with iPhones, which means you&#39;ll get a pretty seamless experience from the moment you take the coin-sized tracker out of the box. The Find My app will immediately recognize the AirTag and you can label it with the name of whatever it&#39;s attached to. Since there&#39;s no keyhole on the AirTag, you will need some sort of case or holder if you want to secure the tracker to your keys, but you can find <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">affordable AirTag accessories</a> easily across the web. Given how small AirTags are, they&#39;ll easily slip into a pocket of your bag or a fold in your wallet without trouble.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once set up, you can return to the Find My app to locate your missing things and you can force the AirTag to emit a chime so you can more easily find your stuff if you&#39;re still relatively close to it. Plus, if you have an iPhone that supports ultra-wideband, the AirTag&#39;s Precision Finding feature can lead you directly to your stuff with directions on your handset&#39;s screen. You may have to wait a bit to get the AirTag as Amazon&#39;s estimated delivery time is at the end of January, but now&#39;s a good opportunity to add an AirTag to your Apple setup and save a bit of money while doing so.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtag-is-the-cheapest-its-ever-been-at-amazon-153819504.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c56f72ad-cab7-435d-95a5-21e94204094d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 15:38:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641224301</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T15:38:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's workout-ready Elite 4 Active earbuds are now available for $120]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130015582.html">Jabra debuted</a> its ultra affordable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">Elite 3</a> earbuds. That model offers all of the core features you&#39;d expect from a set of true wireless earbuds with good sound quality, solid battery life and a comfy fit. And all of that only costs you $80. There were some omissions — most notably the lack of active noise cancellation (ANC) — but the company is officially debuting a new option at CES that checks even more boxes while keeping the price low: <a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active##100-99180702-98">the Elite 4 Active</a>.</p><p>While these earbuds <a href="https://www.jabra.co.uk/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-4-active##100-99180702-98">made an early appearance</a> in the UK <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-wireless-earbuds-142911217.html">last week</a>, Jabra <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jabra-boosts-new-years-fitness-resolutions-with-new-jabra-elite-4-active-true-wireless-earbuds-301452531.html">has now officially announced</a> the new set for the US. The Elite 4 Active features a similar design to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">the range of new earbuds</a> the company began announcing last year. This means the buds should be comfy due to their smaller size and recently redesigned shape. As the name implies, the Elite 4 Active is built to withstand sweaty workouts with an IP57 waterproof rating.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="4c75d991-0fbc-4640-923b-11d3954bc63d"/><p>In terms of audio, the Elite 4 Active houses 6mm drivers and you can tweak the EQ via Jabra&#39;s app. This new model also features ANC, which the more affordable Elite 3 does not. The only caveat is that it&#39;s not adjustable like the noise cancellation on the flagship <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-7-pro-earbuds-price-specs-availability-130040202.html">Elite 7 Pro</a> earbuds. Jabra&#39;s transparency mode, HearThrough, is available on the Elite 4 Active to allow you to hear your surroundings when needed. Four mesh covered microphones assist with calls and Jabra says their design will reduce wind noise.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Elite 3, you can expect up to seven hours of battery life with an additional three charges in the case. Jabra has also included features like the ability to use either earbud solo, Google Fast Pair, Alexa built-in and Spotify Tap playback. The best part?

It has a minimalist design, a lovely 7-inch display, clearer and louder audio than its predecessor and faster performance as well. It&#39;s just the right size to fit into any room without taking up too much space, and you can even place it on your nightstand and it will track your sleep. The feature was a bit finicky when we tested it, but as long as it&#39;s place precisely, you should get data on your sleep duration, quality, schedule and even snoring information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Nest Audio is Google&#39;s $100 smart speaker that competes with Amazon&#39;s Echo and Apple&#39;s HomePod mini. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-smart-home-devices-154557162.html">holds its own</a> against both of those devices and it earned a score of 87 from us for its solid audio quality, charming design, good Google Assistant performance and stereo mode when two of the speakers are paired. It&#39;s the smart speaker to get if you care at all about audio quality and already rely on the Google Assistant a lot. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-review-143012511.html">Nest Mini</a> may seem like an attractive option at $25, but you get what you pay for. Like its Amazon counterpart, the Echo Dot, the Nest Mini is an affordable way to get the Google Assistant into a small place but you&#39;ll sacrifice quite a bit on sound quality.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">Nest Hub Max</a> is for those who want to go all in on both sound and Google smart devices. It has the best audio quality of them all plus a 10-inch display, gesture controls and the ability to double as a Nest Cam. It would make a good home-base smart display, one that sits in your living room or kitchen so everyone in your family has access to it when necessary.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-second-gen-nest-hub-drops-to-60-in-new-years-sale-144818377.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa6e7d7c-f270-4d20-bae9-a70f478d7b72</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 14:48:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221303</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:48:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/61b3b762-90aa-11eb-bffb-bd0d81b2c158" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/61b3b762-90aa-11eb-bffb-bd0d81b2c158" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Hub 2021 (2nd gen) photo.

The game forces you to do things like squat, jog in place and more to move your character through a fantasy world, making it a more interesting way to work out at home, especially during the winter months. Amazon has the pack for $55, or $25 off its usual price, and it&#39;s currently in stock as of writing this, so you can get your hands on it fairly quickly. The price only appears on the product page if you&#39;re a Prime subscriber, but it&#39;s available for all and it will show up once you have the game in your cart.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/31jevsm" id="af4d3c5a87d7429bb047e10a2d3d0dc8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Ring Fit Adventure at Amazon - $55</a><p>Designed to work with the Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-10-ring-fit-adventure-winter-workout.html"><em>Ring Fit Adventure</em></a> tracks motion using the console&#39;s Joy-Cons. One straps to the provided ring while the other attaches to a leg strap so it can keep track of both upper- and lower-body movements. Like regular games that don&#39;t have a sneaky exercise component, you&#39;ll design your character when you first boot up the title and they&#39;ll immediately be plopped into a new world that&#39;s ready to be explored.

It&#39;s designed to provide a unique workout that doesn&#39;t feel like a regular fitness routine. We also appreciate that the game targets all part of the body with the moves it asks you to do, and you can customize it a bit by choosing the exercises you want to run through.

And that, as a consequence, a number of local firms have been forced to exit the business, while some of the larger players are looking to move operations overseas. It’s not clear if the NPPA’s inaction is the direct cause of these closures, especially given the broader debt crisis in China, but there’s a belief that something is up.</p><p>The NPPA has reportedly been tight-lipped about why it’s suddenly decided to stop issuing licenses, but you can likely guess why.

As part of her <a href="https://www.regeringen.dk/nyheder/2022/statsminister-mette-frederiksens-nytaarstale/">New Year’s Address</a>, she said that (translated) “by 2025, Danes must have the opportunity to fly green on a domestic route.” She added that “by 2030 at the latest, we must be able to fly completely green when we fly domestically in Denmark.” It was part of a broader commitment by the leader to toughen measures against polluters and to jump-start the country’s green transition.</p><p>There are, however, reasons to be concerned that such an ambitious deadline can be reached, given the lack of ready alternatives. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/we-wont-have-electric-airplanes-until-battery-tech-improves-160058357.html">Electric planes may never succeed</a>, and hydrogen flying, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-29-hydrogen-fuel-cell-toyota-mirai-evs.html">while much more promising</a>, is nowhere near ready to be rolled out to a major airline’s fleet. Not to mention, of course, that only hydrogen produced as a result of electrolysis, powered by excess renewable energy, can be called truly “green.” <a href="https://energiwatch.dk/Energinyt/Politik___Markeder/article12437427.ece"><em>EnergiWatch</em></a> has said that Denmark’s standing policy of waiting for magic bullet technologies to come to fruition is not going to help it reach its international commitments on climate emissions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, Denmark has made more steps than some countries to help make the transition toward zero-carbon technologies. The country has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/denmark-to-end-offshore-oil-gas-pumping-by-2050-162837374.html">issued a hard deadline</a> to end oil and gas exploration and is a big player in the wind power industry. At the start of 2021, it committed to build an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/denmark-energy-island-north-sea-wind-power-140022879.html">artificial island</a> which could collect and store power from Denmark’s wind farms, enough to supply 10GW. At the same time, the country hopes that any excess wind power can be used to drive an electrolyzer, helping it develop a nice sideline as a producer of guilt-free Hydrogen.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/denmark-pledges-green-domestic-flights-by-2030-101536240.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2001297e-d119-458d-92eb-567c9196dd9d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 10:15:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641202848</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T09:40:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/879e5a20-6c78-11ec-bffb-0cd8e5d823cd" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/879e5a20-6c78-11ec-bffb-0cd8e5d823cd" width="4928" height="3280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airbus A320 SAS Airlines.

That&#39;s the basic idea behind Alienware&#39;s Concept Nyx, a server that&#39;s powerful enough to run all of your games throughout your home network. Think of it like Plex for gaming, but instead of opening up your video library, it&#39;s all about bringing your games to all of your devices.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="54ce5d27-bc2d-4b74-b9be-83a73968f1f9"/><p>Given the push toward game streaming  from Google Stadia and Xbox, Alienware may have stumbled on an interesting solution for multi-gamer homes. You could conceivably run two games at once on your television, as we saw during a recent demo in NYC. Or you could play <em>Cyberpunk</em> while someone else perfects their <em>Rocket League</em> skills on another device. Since all of the rendering and network processing is happening in your home, Nyx would also be a lower latency experience than traditional cloud gaming, which relies on servers hundreds of miles away.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Concept</em> is the key word here, though. Alienware representatives wouldn&#39;t tell us what&#39;s powering the mysterious Nyx server, which looked like an enormous gaming desktop. And while my colleague Cherlynn Low and I were able to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Rocket League</em> simultaneously on a single TV, the games were running in tiny windows. It wasn&#39;t anywhere near the sleek half-screen experience Dell is showing off in promotional pictures.</p><p>Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-dell-concept-ufo-portable-gaming-pc.html">Alienware&#39;s Concept UFO</a>, a Switch-like portable gaming PC that was first demoed two years ago, Nyx may never see the light of day. But we could see elements of it in future products, much like the way the UFO controller is being used demonstrate Nyx. The game server concept could eventually simplify streaming from your rig. That&#39;s something we can already do with Steam&#39;s Remote Play feature, but perhaps Dell could make it a bit easier to play all of your titles throughout your home. The company says it&#39;s also exploring ways to run four games at once, as well as methods of collecting all of your titles, no matter where you installed them.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3c20402-6989-11ec-b3f5-e7fa8bacb0d1" alt="Alienware Concept Nyx UFO Controller" data-uuid="b80a62dd-a72b-3174-822f-6e3966d29f38"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alienware-concept-nyx-game-server-050141873.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">87304ad2-084a-465a-8503-1128f18f48ea</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 05:01:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221515</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:52:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3c20401-6989-11ec-afaf-6dd46fb095e8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3c20401-6989-11ec-afaf-6dd46fb095e8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alienware Concept Nyx]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alienware Concept Nyx]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung is putting NFTs in its smart TVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given that 2021 was a blockbuster year <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-tech-products-and-companies-2021-143005186.html">for NFTs</a>, it’s not particularly surprising that major tech companies are incorporating Non-Fungible Tokens into their CES lineup.

To start, the mainstream Neo QLED sets now include what <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/">Samsung</a> says are the first 4K and 8K sets with 144Hz inputs instead of the usual 120Hz. The extra fluidity won&#39;t be immediately useful when even the fastest PCs struggle with high-speed 4K and 8K content, but you won&#39;t have to worry about your premium TV becoming obsolete any time soon.</p><p>The TVs promise image quality improvements regardless of the source. All the 8K and 4K Neo QLED sets have jumped from a 12-bit backlight to 14-bit, providing more accurate brightness. They also boast a new Shape Adaptive Light Control feature that theoretically improves the mini-LED sets&#39; quality, and an AI-driven Object Depth Enhancer can help distinguish a picture&#39;s main subject from its background.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Software plays an important role as well. All the 2022 Samsung TVs have a new home screen that helps aggregate streaming content and offers an ambient display when idle. A Gaming Hub can directly launch console- and cloud-based games, while a new Game Bar helps you customize relevant picture settings. Watch Together is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-review-150030599.html">SharePlay</a>-style mode that lets you talk to distant friends while you watch broadcasts and streaming shows. And since this is 2022, you can even shop for and display <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">NFTs</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f01be3d0-6c17-11ec-9bfb-c507f83e0a49" alt="Samsung MicroLED TV (2022)" data-uuid="7c0958fc-917b-35cc-bf81-3a0921d582b5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>Other sets have their own share of upgrades. Samsung&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-microled-tvs-ces-160052013.html">MicroLED line</a> (shown at middle) is now bezel-free, so your giant luxury TV should blend more seamlessly with your decor. They also tout a 10 percent wider color range, and you can buy a &#39;small&#39; 89-inch preconfigured set if the 99- and 110-inch variants won&#39;t quite fit. And if the bezels are precisely what you want, 2022 The Frame (below) sets now have more canvas-like matte displays and a fresh art store interface.</p><p>As is often the case, Samsung hasn&#39;t provided availability and price ranges as of this writing. The Frame will be available in sizes between 32 and 85 inches, though, and you can presume both 8K screens and MicroLED models will carry stiff premiums. It&#39;s too soon to say whether they&#39;ll compete well against rival models <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-ex-enhance-brightness-30-percent-095813152.html">from LG</a>, Sony and other brands. With that said, it&#39;s evident Samsung still isn&#39;t in a rush to embrace OLED TVs and counter its best-known challengers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/55cd5e20-6c18-11ec-9998-1be77eca943e" alt="Samsung The Frame TV (2022)" data-uuid="fb4af850-3b71-33ce-acc0-553207405fe1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2022-qled-microled-8k-4k-tv-020046596.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e48f21dd-628f-4403-9cd1-46dee26e1ad1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 02:00:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221189</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:46:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8e0d0bb0-6c17-11ec-ae75-15522ac2e777" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8e0d0bb0-6c17-11ec-ae75-15522ac2e777" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN800B TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Neo QLED 8K QN800B TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung is baking Stadia and GeForce Now into its TVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung" href="https://fave.co/31Ygak3">Samsung</a> is overhauling its TV interface, and it&#39;s looking to pull many of your gaming needs together in one place.

As users discovered, Exchange was trying to store version date checks for its antivirus scanning engine in a 32-bit integer variable — a big problem when any date from January 1st, 2022 onward was too large. Any new checks made the malware engine crash and left email stuck in a queue.</p><p>The emergency fix uses a PowerShell script to pause two services, replace the older antivirus engine files with newer ones that use a new number sequence, and restart operations. The fix requires manual input and could take a long time to implement for larger companies, but an automatic solution is in development.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This shouldn&#39;t affect other Exchange customers. The timing is also &#39;ideal&#39; as a holiday weekend likely limited the demand for email. Company IT managers probably didn&#39;t want to start 2022 patching servers, though, and it&#39;s unclear why Microsoft didn&#39;t foresee a date issue with software released just a few years ago. Whatever the reasoning, this serves as a clear lesson about anticipating date bugs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-exchange-year-2022-bug-fix-215225070.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce8aadc6-d19e-43f0-a1f7-936e90fd7706</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 21:52:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641160348</ingested><modified>2022-01-02T21:52:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-05/d3785c90-92e8-11ea-bfaa-3649fd1cd417" width="3420" height="2280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-05/d3785c90-92e8-11ea-bfaa-3649fd1cd417" width="3420" height="2280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Trutschel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - APRIL 22: The logo of the software Microsoft Outlook is shown on the display of a smartphone on April 22, 2020 in Berlin, Germany.

As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860029/samsung-smart-monitor-m8-4k-smartthings-iot-workspace-game-home">notes</a>, the company is starting things off with the Smart Monitor M8. The 32-inch 4K display offers TV functionality <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unveils-a-43-inch-version-of-its-tv-like-smart-monitors-075604949.html">like its predecessors</a>, but now includes a SmartThings hub to control compatible smart home devices directly from your screen. It&#39;s also better-suited for video chats thanks to an included magnetic SlimFit webcam you can use with Google Duo and other apps.</p><p>The M8 can also serve as a platform for (as yet unnamed) game streaming services, complete with wireless gamepad support. More details are coming closer to launch, Samsung said. Workspace also folds Microsoft 365 and other cloud productivity services into a single space.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung hasn&#39;t mentioned pricing or a release date for the Smart Monitor M8. While it&#39;s smaller than the 43-inch M7 (normally $600), the smart home features and webcam could keep the price relatively high.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7f30d6f0-6c0b-11ec-9daf-32d24dddfedb" alt="Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 curved gaming monitor" data-uuid="43258947-8dc1-355b-bbad-91643baba057"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The other display might cost less than previous models, however. Samsung has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860012/samsung-odyssey-neo-g8-4k-240hz-refresh-rate-monitor-mini-led-specs">unveiled</a> a 32-inch Odyssey Neo G8 gaming monitor that should be far smaller than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-price-pre-order-020000540.html">49-inch Neo G9</a> while preserving the pronounced 1000R curve, mini-LED technology, 240Hz refresh rate and 2,000-nit peak brightness. It even jumps to a 4K resolution — this is the first 4K monitor to support 240Hz and a 1ms pixel response time, Samsung claimed. Support for both NVIDIA&#39;s G-Sync and AMD&#39;s FreeSync Premium Pro should keep tearing artifacts to a minimum.</p><p>There&#39;s no mention of a price or ship date for the Odyssey Neo G8. Given the size reduction, it won&#39;t be surprising if the screen costs less than the $2,500 G9 even with the resolution bump.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-smart-monitor-m8-odyssey-neo-g8-204612785.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10951aa1-6f66-4641-aed8-b2e23c8e234d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 20:46:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221171</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:46:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c194dee0-6c08-11ec-bbf4-c12cfcf9e9bd" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c194dee0-6c08-11ec-bbf4-c12cfcf9e9bd" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Smart Monitor M8]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Smart Monitor M8]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
