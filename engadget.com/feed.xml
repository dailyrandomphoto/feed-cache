Amazon has <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/fire-tv-is-on-the-move-in-2022-e3f8860bc6b9">revealed</a> Fire TV is coming to more vehicles this year, including 2022 Ford Explorer and Lincoln Navigator SUVs.

The company didn&#39;t provide timelines for when the interface would be available.</p><p>Fire TV in cars is, effectively, a small-scale version of what you might be used to at home: passengers can watch videos, run apps and use Alexa, just with an interface optimized for seatback screens. You can save some content for offline access if you&#39;re driving through areas where internet access is spotty. The version currently in the Jeep Wagoneer includes a remote that also controls some car functions, but it&#39;s not clear if that will carry over to Ford vehicles.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon clearly sees in-car Fire TV as a way to keep users in its ecosystem when they&#39;re away from home.

During its CES 2022 keynote address on Wednesday, GM CEO Mary Barra officially unveiled the new 2024 Chevrolet Silverado EV, GM&#39;s second fully electric model built on the Ultium battery platform.</p><p>The fully-electric full size pickup will be available in two versions when it arrives late next year; the RST First Edition and a WT model designed for fleet usage. Both will offer an estimated 400-mile range,  accommodate up to 350 kW DC fast charging speeds, and include 10.2kW of offboard power to run anything from  corded power tools to home accessories in the event of a power outage. The RST is expected to have up to 664 horsepower with more than 780 lb-ft of torque, run a 0-60 in under 4.5 seconds (according to GM estimates).

Today the company has unveiled a tire with 70 percent sustainable material content, which shows the progress it has made towards achieving its ultimate goal. The tire features 13 ingredients across nine different tire components, including three different carbon blacks that are traditionally made by burning petroleum products.</p><p>Carbon black is typically used as a filler to reinforce tires, as well as other rubber products, and to lengthen their lifespan. Instead of using carbon black produced using petroleum, Goodyear used ones that were made using methane, carbon dioxide and plant-based oil. The company says the methods of production its suppliers used to create the sustainable carbon blacks generated less carbon emissions than traditional processes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Goodyear has also been using <a href="https://corporate.goodyear.com/us/en/responsibility/sustainable-sourcing/sustainable-materials.html">soybean oil</a> for certain tire lines instead of petroleum oil, and this one is no different. Soybean oil allows tires to remain pliable in changing temperatures with added traction benefits. The company had been aiming to use 100 percent soybean oil in four of its tire lines in 2020, but it fell short due to production issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Goodyear&#39;s new tire uses a variety of silica, which improves tire grip and help lower fuel consumption, made from rice husk ash, as well. Rice husk ash is a by-product of rice milling, and it&#39;s pretty abundant in rice producing countries. Researchers have ben looking into its use as an alternative for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214509516300924#!">cement</a> and and as a <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21870764.2018.1539210">source of silica</a>, and according to Goodwill, it was able to produce high-quality silica from the waste material. In addition, the company broke down polyester materials recycled from plastic bottles and other plastic wastes into their base chemicals. They were then turned into technical grade polyester used for tire cords that maintain the shape of the tire.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris Helsel, chief technology officer at Goodyear, said the 70 percent sustainable tire &quot;is an exciting achievement that demonstrates [the company&#39;s] commitment to increasing the use of sustainable materials.&quot; That said, it was manufactured as a demo product, and the company has yet to reveal whether it will be released to the public.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/goodyear-prototype-tire-70-percent-sustainable-materials-170024650.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">04e4c213-5e99-43b3-b007-800d654e706c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 17:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641387646</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T13:00:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/588dc0a0-6e1b-11ec-84ff-6d09059a7c65" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/588dc0a0-6e1b-11ec-84ff-6d09059a7c65" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Goodyear]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Goodyear]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Goodyear]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASUS' ZenBook 14 OLED models get a big redesign and the latest chips]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With Intel and AMD announcing new processors this week, many PC manufacturers are also sharing details on their latest laptops. One of those is ASUS, which on Wednesday unveiled its 2022 ZenBook 14 lineup. At first glance, the most notable difference about the new &quot;ZenBook 14 OLED&quot; is that it features an updated design that&#39;s more square and less obtrusively branded.&nbsp;</p><p>ASUS will offer separate versions of the ZenBook 14 OLED with the latest CPUs from Intel and AMD. You’ll need to go for a 12th-gen Core H processor if you want DDR5 RAM and Thunderbolt 4 connectivity. Ryzen models will ship with DDR4X memory instead. Either way, you can configure the ZenBook 14 OLED with up to 16GB of RAM, though you’ll get faster clock speeds from the DDR5 modules. In addition to up to 1TB of PCIe storage, there’s an extra M.2 slot available if you decide you need more space. Powering everything is a 75Whr cell, and the entire laptop weighs less than three pounds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ZenBook 14 OLED comes with plenty of ports for an ultraportable, including two USB-C connections, a single USB-A port, HDMI 2.0, a headphone jack, and a microSD card slot. It also comes with WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 support. If you get an Intel CPU, the two USB-C ports will offer Thunderbolt 4 connectivity, allowing for data transfer speeds of 40Gbps.</p><p>However, the highlight of the ZenBook 14 OLED is without question its display. On paper, it’s impressive. It’s a 14-inch OLED panel with 2,880 x 1,800 resolution, 16:10 aspect ratio and 550-nit peak brightness. Add to that 100 percent DCI-P3 coverage, DisplayHDR 500 True Black certification, a 90Hz refresh rate and claimed 0.2 millisecond response time, and you have a display that should be equally great for productivity, gaming and video streaming.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/81349540-68e1-11ec-bfeb-5896580971f7" alt="ZenBook 14 OLED Space Edition" data-uuid="098fa6b1-d309-382e-ab4b-681db561c483"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>ASUS will also sell a “Space Edition” of the ZenBook 14 OLED. It has many of the same features as the standard 14-inch model, but you can configure it with up to 32GB of DDR5 RAM. However, your only option on the CPU front is an Intel processor. Notably, it also comes with a smaller 63 Whr battery. The computer&#39;s exterior, which includes a 3.5-inch OLED display, was inspired by the MIR space station. Morse code across the outside of the laptop says Ad Astra Per Aspera. Roughly translated from Latin, that’s “through the hardships to the stars.”</p><p>There’s no word yet on pricing for either the ZenBook 14 OLED or ZenBook 14x OLED Space Edition, but ASUS promised to share more information when the laptops go on sale closer to the second half of 2022.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-14-oled-annoucement-164536850.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6587670e-1d70-4299-a95e-63e2ee7091dc</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:45:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221914</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:58:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9c232f30-68df-11ec-87b7-c90ec0a156c0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9c232f30-68df-11ec-87b7-c90ec0a156c0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ASUS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ZenBook 14x OLED Space Edition]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ZenBook 14x OLED Space Edition]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASUS made a wild 17-inch foldable OLED tablet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/asus/"><ins>ASUS</ins></a> has a lot more to show off at CES than traditional laptops.

This year, in addition to launching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-2022-blade-lineup-ces-170053808.html">new laptops</a>, it’s also teamed up with smartwatch maker <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Fossil" href="https://fave.co/3kFxcfp">Fossil</a> to launch a special edition wearable. The two companies are announcing the Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch at CES 2022 and it’s basically what you think: A themed version of an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">existing Wear OS device</a> with straps and faces that reflect the gaming company’s identity.</p><p>But the Razer edition of the Gen 6 has some small differences. It only comes in the 44mm size (while the original is also available in 42mm) and also features some unique interface elements. I’ve had a sample to play with for awhile, and frankly, this feels like most Fossil smartwatches, just with an aesthetic nod to Razer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Fossil Gen 6 was the first to feature Qualcomm’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-wear-4100-plus-150008576.html">Snapdragon Wear 4100+</a> chip, and like the original series, the Razer edition will be updated to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">new Wear OS 3</a> later this year. So far, the existing software on the watch felt familiar and performed quickly. I swiped through cards and changed watch faces with no delay, though that’s par for the course for Wear OS watches these days. The three custom watch faces for the Razer-branded wearable were what I expected — that is, they had matching color schemes and displayed the time in &quot;fun&quot; fonts. The Wellness face shows your daily stats, but doesn’t look very Razer-esque.</p><p>There’s not much else different about the device, and most other elements like battery life and system performance require me spending much more time with it to test.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/54996550-6db5-11ec-ae3a-84efc5dfd407" alt="The Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch with black straps on a wrist and the exclusive Wellness watch face. " data-uuid="e489acd5-c310-35aa-a176-36b87a551ae1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>What I <em>can</em> say now is that as a person with smaller wrists, the Razer watch is a bit too big for me. Are most Razer fans people more big-boned, or do they prefer a chunky aesthetic? I don’t know, but it sure seems like that assumption is being made.</p><p>One thing I do believe Razer’s loyalists love is the company’s distinct acid green color that permeates their products. The special edition Gen 6 comes in a black finish with a black 22mm band with no pops of green on the case itself. But it does come with a bright green strap that you can swap out. Both silicone bands were pliable and comfortable, though, again, I’d prefer a narrower style.</p><p>The larger size does allow for a roomier screen (though the 42mm Gen 6 has the same display dimensions), and I enjoyed how easy it was to read app titles and notifications.</p><p>Razer and Fossil are only selling 1,337 units of this special edition device, because Leet, get it? Anyway, you can get one for $329. For comparison, the Fossil Gen 6 costs between $299 and $319. With its higher price and limited quantity, the Razer watch is clearly meant to be a collectible for the most loyal of the company’s fans.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/776be2b0-6db5-11ec-b37e-3e69af314d21" alt="The Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch with black straps on a wrist, showing a list of apps including one called " data-uuid="6e2dedc3-6ab0-3feb-82b2-d427374d62c3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you don’t manage to get one of the Razer watches or are intrigued by Fossil’s other brands, you could also consider the new Skagen Gen 6. The Skagen Falster is my favorite of Fossil’s smartwatches, and the company is launching an updated version that offers its latest suite of features like the Snapdragon Wear 4100 processor, faster battery charging and upgraded sensors. It’ll be available in six styles and cost $295.</p><p>Fossil also told Engadget that the Gen 6 series will be getting Alexa support early this year, so those who use Amazon’s assistant for smart home device control can do that from their wrists.</p><p>The Razer x Fossil watch represents an intriguing expansion of Fossil’s lineup, though we might see the company team up with other brands in future. Fossil told me it’s open to the idea, so who knows? Maybe one day we’ll see collabs with the likes of Tesla, McDonalds or, oh God, White Castle.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-x-fossil-gen-6-smartwatch-hands-on-160052253.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">96562190-44ea-4765-89e2-1b11467c1d85</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641399449</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T16:17:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/36390f20-6db5-11ec-bfff-0ea23ded7989" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/36390f20-6db5-11ec-bfff-0ea23ded7989" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch with acid green straps on a wrist.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Razer x Fossil Gen 6 smartwatch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lenovo's ultrawide 17-inch laptop has an 8-inch screen next to the keyboard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="3ba00dbee7b543e091b5bd5d497ac691"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GNK7xDUdhL4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Lenovo" href="https://bit.ly/3JCsg6O">Lenovo</a> always unveils a cornucopia of gadgets at CES and this year is no different. In addition to smart home products and various laptops, the company is showing off an unconventional approach to PCs. Since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-e-ink-screen-hands-on.html">introducing the ThinkBook Plus series in 2020</a>, Lenovo has used it as a platform to roll out unusual form factors, like the previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-2-i-e-ink-screen-laptop-170048754.html">iteration with an e-ink screen on its lid</a>.</p><p>Now that the laptop is in its third generation, Lenovo is moving its second panel down to the keyboard deck and making it a full-color LCD instead. Not only is this approach more useful, it’s also potentially more power-intensive. At a recent hands-on in New York (held in accordance with COVID-19 regulations), I checked out the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 and, in spite of some bugs, I’m intrigued by the premise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The laptop’s main screen is a 17.3 inch IPS display that runs at a 3K resolution. It’s accompanied by an 8-inch 800 x 1,280 LCD to the right of the keyboard and features an integrated digitizer layer to enable stylus support. The machine runs an interesting version of Windows 11 that offers several more orientations, in addition to the typical snap shortcuts that you see when you hover over an app’s title bar.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/81a8bb60-6de5-11ec-8fed-a1c22184d118" alt="A close up of the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 3, focusing on a dialog box showing seven different app layout options. " data-uuid="ede3f749-3fca-3112-b5d9-915215ec3f88"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>On the ThinkBook Plus, when you drag an app, a small dialog box pops up with two suggested layouts (and five more appear when you hover over an arrow here). Windows 11 will just see the 8-inch LCD as an external screen and push out content the way it would to your connected monitors. You can choose to snap a window to take up the whole bottom panel, half of it, cover the entire top display, take up only two thirds of it and more. The most unconventional of these layouts is something Lenovo called “waterfall” where an app can spill over the top screen into the bottom, which could be nifty for extra long lists.</p><p>I dragged a long spreadsheet into waterfall mode, for example, and could see entire columns at a glance. Or say you’re watching a live-changing Ted Talk up top and want to jot down notes by hand. Writing on the demo unit was surprisingly smooth with satisfying latency. I also appreciated the position of the pad because it felt more intuitive than trying to draw on a laptop’s display.</p><p>During my hands-on, the ThinkBook Plus was responsive at snapping apps where I wanted them to go and did so quickly. But it struggled when launching some other functions that Lenovo built into the lower display.</p><p>There’s a whiteboard tool that turns the panel into a notepad, as well as a digital numpad. With supported apps like Adobe Lightroom, you can also have a dedicated dashboard of shortcuts or a magnified view sitting next to the keyboard. Lenovo made a “Magic Launcher,” which is a row of buttons at the bottom of this screen for quick access to the whiteboard, numpad and other specialized software.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ae518840-6de5-11ec-bfff-6cd0fa3ba023" alt="A close up of the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 3&#39;s 8-inch screen with the words " data-uuid="2f533302-0555-3368-a23b-b707ab10f5b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>This was the most buggy part of my hands-on experience. Sometimes, tapping the buttons wouldn’t work (or would take more than a few seconds before anything happened). The demo unit crashed at least once, too. But we’re at least a few months away from May, when Lenovo expects to sell these machines, so it has some time to iron out these kinks.</p><p>The rest of the system performed as expected. The main 17.3-inch IPS display runs at 3,072 x 1,440, which is an aspect ratio of 21:10. It’s easy enough to split three apps on that roomy screen, though if you want to use all of it for editing pictures in Lightroom, at least you can keep an eye on Slack or Twitter with the bottom display.</p><p>Keeping all this running is a 12th-generation Intel Core processor with up to 32GB of DDR5 RAM. It uses <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-xe-gpu-gamers-130000411.html">Intel’s Xe graphics with Unified Memory Architecture</a>, which should be powerful enough for some photo editing. There&#39;s also a Full HD IR camera with a privacy shutter and an array of ports including an HDMI socket, two USB A jacks and a Thunderbolt 4 connection.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d188bae0-6de5-11ec-9eef-d288ce2d18eb" alt="The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 sitting on a round white table with a stylus next to it. The laptop shows Adobe Lighthouse taking up the left half of the main display, while an oversized numpad appears on the 8-inch screen to the right of the keyboard." data-uuid="95fb04e2-024a-396e-b1df-dffac3cf4895"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s worth noting that the battery size here is 69 Whr, which is pretty typical for most laptops this size. But most laptops this size don&#39;t also have a secondary monitor to power, so we&#39;ll have to wait till we can test one out for ourselves to get a sense for real-world endurance. You&#39;ll only be able to get these in May, and they&#39;ll start at $1,399.</p><p>Lenovo also announced a slew of other products in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-13-lenovo-thinkbook-and-thinkpad-x1-extreme.html">ThinkBook</a> and ThinkCentre family of business-minded devices. There’s the updated <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkbook-13x-review-is-this-business-laptop-worth-dollar1200">ThinkBook 13x</a> Gen 2, which can work with a “Wireless Multi-Device Charging Mat” that recharges Qi-compatible gadgets while also powering the laptop itself. The company also debuted a new ThinkCentre Neo line comprising three desktop systems for small and medium businesses. Finally, the new ThinkBook 14 and 16 Gen 4+ i (yes, that’s part of the name, not a stray letter) sport 16:10 screens running at 90Hz and 120Hz respectively, among other updates.</p><p>The ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 is one of the most eye-catching things I&#39;ve seen this CES, though that’s not to say Lenovo is breaking new ground. ASUS has already made <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-asus-zenbook-pro-duo-review.html">several dual-screen laptops</a> in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zenbook-duo-review-dual-screen-ultraportable-140045662.html">ZenBook Pro Duo series</a>, and Lenovo itself also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-10-17-lenovo-yoga-book-review.html">tried before</a> with the ill-fated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-25-lenovo-yoga-book-c930-review-an-expensive-experiment.html">Yoga Book</a> line. Dell and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-29-intel-dual-screen-laptop-prototype-hands-on.html">Intel</a> have shown off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-dell-concept-ori-duet-foldable-dual-screen-pc-hands-on-2020.html">some concepts</a>, too  and I&#39;m very intrigued by the premise here. With Windows 11’s release last year, it seems like more PC makers could be ready to deliver real dual-screen laptops and we could see more of them in 2022. As a taste of what’s to come, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 is tantalizing and I applaud Lenovo for continuing to try and innovate.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-3-dual-screen-laptop-hands-on-price-specs-availability-160028888.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">363f2653-2897-4242-b0ff-c02a8bbe79a9</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641399325</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T16:15:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/09434f60-6de4-11ec-b79b-ff163956c328" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/09434f60-6de4-11ec-b79b-ff163956c328" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 3 on a table showing Lightroom on the top screen and the Engadget website on the screen at the bottom next to the keyboard.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[KeyMander Nexus Gaming KVM connects your PC to Xbox, Switch and PS4]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The KeyMander Nexus Gaming KVM is the next evolution of IOGEAR&#39;s connective hardware for PC and consoles, and it&#39;s due to come out between April and June 2022 for $200.

This is in line with previous iterations of the KeyMander switches, which also have limited functionality with PS5.</p><p>&quot;We have limited support for PS5, can only play PS4 and non-DualSense PS5 games,&quot; an IOGEAR spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;We are looking to launch a dongle in late Q2 that may bring full support.&quot; Q2 ends ends in June 2022, the spokesperson clarified.</p><p>IOGEAR has been talking about that dongle for <a href="http://keymander2.com/thread/606/67">about seven months</a> now, and the use of &quot;may&quot; in that statement isn&#39;t reassuring. Sony&#39;s DualSense controllers for the PS5 include a range of new features, like adaptive triggers and ultra-sensitive haptics, and several titles actually require this gamepad to function. This makes it difficult to translate PS5 games to a standard input method like a keyboard and mouse. However, IOGEAR says it&#39;s still trying.</p><p>There are ways to <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/guides/games-with-mouse-and-keyboard-support-on-xbox-one-series-x-series-s">play certain games</a> with a keyboard and mouse plugged directly into consoles, but these titles are limited. Not only does the Nexus Gaming KVM unlock this input method for every game on supported systems, but it keeps things organized by running each console through a single monitor and headset, negating the need to swap screens and controllers. Unless you have a PS5, for now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iogear-keymander-nexus-gaming-kvm-xbox-switch-ps4-keyboard-mouse-160016494.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">028630d6-88b4-4e9d-bf6b-35a45d7da917</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641393996</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T14:46:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1d4cf130-6d91-11ec-baff-03b72b4237a6" width="596" height="367" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1d4cf130-6d91-11ec-baff-03b72b4237a6" width="596" height="367" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IOGEAR]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[KeyMander Nexus Gaming KVM]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[KeyMander Nexus Gaming KVM]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lenovo packs new AMD and Intel CPUs into slimmer Legion gaming laptops]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Lenovo" href="https://bit.ly/3JCsg6O">Lenovo</a> is bombarding CES 2022 with a wave of new PCs, and it won&#39;t surprise to hear that gaming laptops play an important role. The company has introduced seventh-generation Legion 5 (shown below) and Legion 5 Pro (above) portables that are cooler and thinner while packing new AMD <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-6000-mobile-cpu-rdna2-gaming-160037129.html">Ryzen 6000</a> and Intel <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-cpu-laptops-alder-lake-181007259.html">12th-gen Core</a> CPUs. The AMD-based 5 Pro and Intel-based 5i Pro are sleeker than their predecessors, but offer the latest chips thanks to a revamped cooling system with slimmer fans, a larger exhaust area, a copper block heat sink and a more effective heat pipe layout — hopefully, the thermal issues with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-5-pro-review-2021-172935947.html">last year&#39;s models</a> are no more.</p><p>You can also expect options for the latest GeForce <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3070-ti-3080-ti-laptop-gpu-ces-announcement-163355552.html">RTX 30 series GPUs</a>, improved WiFi 6e performance and a 16-inch 2,960 x 1,600 IPS panel with a rare 240Hz adaptive refresh rate. You&#39;ll also find up to 1TB of SSD storage, four-zone RGB lighting and up to 300W charging with a proprietary solution (135W through USB-C). The Legion 5i Pro arrives in February starting at $1,570, while the 5 Pro debuts in April for $1,430.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/57b2b440-6daa-11ec-bbfb-7e92ed2cea07" alt="Lenovo Legion 5i gaming laptop (2022)" data-uuid="3b51886a-baab-3393-bdae-d21abbe84ac1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lenovo</div></figure><p>Cost-conscious gamers won&#39;t have to give up much. The non-Pro Legion 5 and 5i models also use new AMD, Intel and NVIDIA parts, but they&#39;re 15 percent thinner while boasting more powerful fan systems and larger exhaust areas. They should feel better on your lap, too, thanks to an aluminum-magnesium hybrid cover. The 15-inch, 165Hz 1440p screen won&#39;t be quite as impressive as what you&#39;ll find on the Pro models, but it still offers a speedy 165Hz refresh rate and full sRGB color space coverage. Four-zone RGB is optional.</p><p>The regular Legion 5i ships in February starting at $1,200. Wait until April and you can buy the AMD-powered Legion 5 from $1,130.</p><p>This being Lenovo, there&#39;s also a slew of peripherals on deck. The 24.5-inch Legion Y25-30 monitor (due in May for $340) mates a 240Hz refresh rate and DisplayHDR 400 support with a high-accuracy IPS panel, while 24- and 27-inch G24qe-20 and G27qe-20 monitors (both coming in March for $260 and $300) provide the basics. The Legion M600s ($85, May) is a lightweight, ambidextrous wireless gaming mouse with a 19,000DPI sensor, while the M300s wired mouse ($30, May) packs RGB lighting and an 8,000 DPI sensor.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-legion-gaming-laptops-ces-2022-160013358.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6b980f6b-592a-4940-a29a-f60afa89920f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641399290</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T16:14:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a57faf10-6da6-11ec-bdea-c34b98fc3823" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a57faf10-6da6-11ec-bdea-c34b98fc3823" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lenovo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lenovo Legion 5 Pro gaming laptop (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Legion 5 Pro gaming laptop (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer and Fossil made a limited edition smartwatch for gamers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s now a more affordable way to wear your devotion to gaming on your wrist. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Razer" href="https://fave.co/3uDrIp3">Razer</a> and Fossil have teamed up to release a limited-edition <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">Gen 6 smartwatch</a> built with gamers in mind. The new wristwear adds three custom watch faces — yes, including an RGB-inspired &quot;Chroma&quot; face.

Not these are necessarily bad things — the Razer watch should be a fast, capable timepiece. You won&#39;t get LTE and you&#39;ll have just 8GB of storage, but the very fast charging (80 percent in 30 minutes) should keep the device powered even if you regularly use sleep tracking.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Razer x Fossil watch will be available worldwide later in January for a reasonable $329.

Today, it’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Lenovo&#x002019;s" href="https://bit.ly/3JCsg6O">Lenovo’s</a> turn, busting out a refreshed range of ThinkPad X1 and Yoga machines with new, 12th-generation Intel Core chips and plenty of razzle-dazzle.</p><p>The flagship X1 range is welcoming a 10th-generation X1 Carbon, seventh-generation X1 Yoga and a second-generation X1 Nano. Those high-end machines are targeted at professionals currently caught between the office and working from home, like so many of us are these days. That means the big focus is making sure you don’t look completely awful while you’re sat in yet another endless Zoom meeting.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That’s why these new models all get a redesigned “communications bar,” which is a fancy way of describing the webcam housing. Nestled inside you’ll find a “superior camera,” with a number of options, including a standard HD camera or an FHD + IR camera, paired with quad-array microphones. You can also opt for a Computer Vision bundle that, Lenovo promises, will be able to automatically detect which person is in front of the machine for a faster log-in experience.</p><p>You can also spec these machines with OLED displays, a 2.8k option for the X1 Carbon and a full 4K OLED for the X1 Yoga. Plus, there’s WiFi 6E, options for 4G or 5G modems and support for Tile’s finding features to help you never misplace your machine. The ThinkPad X1 Carbon (Gen 10) and Yoga (Gen 7) will be available in March, with prices starting at $1,639 and $1,749, respectively. The X1 Nano (Gen 2), meanwhile, will turn up a month later in April, with the base model due to cost $1,659.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ed3fcff0-6e1a-11ec-bbbf-d4772fd5fbdd" alt="Lenovo Yoga 9i" data-uuid="5d392908-5268-363d-8ab5-bd1533f35149"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lenovo</div></figure><p>At the same time, Lenovo also wants to talk about its not-X line of Yoga machines, including the Yoga 9i, Yoga 71 and Yoga 6. The 9i is the flagship 2-in-1 for the year, which comes with the option of new 12th-generation Intel Core chips paired with Iris Xe graphics — making it an Intel Evo-certified machine. Lenovo says that this new model has vastly-improved (Bowers and Wilkins’) audio which is much louder than before, too. You’ll also be able to get the 9i with a 16:10, 4K OLED IPS touchscreen with 100 percent DCI-P3 color accuracy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the 7i gets the option of a 2.8K OLED touchscreen (for the 14-inch) or a 2.5K LCD 60Hz display (for the 16-inch model). Both get the option of a Intel Core i7, paired with Iris Xe graphics, rapid charging and screens optimized for graphics professionals. The Yoga 6, meanwhile, is designed to burnish Lenovo’s environmental credentials, with its recycled aluminum cover or fabric-wrapped cover made with 50 percent recycled plastics.</p><p>You can expect to get your hands on the Yoga 9i at some point in Q2, 2022, with the base model available for $1,399. The 16-inch Yoga 7i will retail for $899, while its smaller sibling will set you back $949 before you’ve started speccing it up, and both arrive in Q2 this year as well. Finally, the Yoga 6 with a Ryzen 5000 will require you to hand over $749, and if you guessed that these would also drop at some point in Q2, you deserve a cookie.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkpad-carbon-x-1-x-1-nano-x1-yoga-i9-2022-update-160002156.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b75c8ab0-1f7a-40ac-944e-5e43ef6ff33a</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 16:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641399159</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T16:12:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a83c4550-6e1a-11ec-b319-22c352cd16f9" width="1280" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a83c4550-6e1a-11ec-b319-22c352cd16f9" width="1280" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lenovo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the new ThinkPad.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo ThinkPad Carbon X1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ring's new Glass Break sensor does exactly what you think]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Ring" href="https://amzn.to/34e9fay">Ring</a> is today beefing up its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-always-home-cam-beta-test-invite-only-163911030.html">home</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-police-state-robots-personal-security-dystopia-203641655.html">security</a> portfolio with a new Glass Break Sensor which does the job you already guessed it does based on the name.

Amazon and Lockheed Martin have <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-take-me-to-the-moon">revealed</a> NASA will carry Alexa to space aboard the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-i-sls-launch-date-163749274.html">Artemis I mission</a> launching later in 2022. While that flight is uncrewed, the companies are planning a &quot;virtual crew experience&quot; at NASA&#39;s Johnson Space Center that will let people in Mission Control (including students and special guests) simulate conversations between the digital helper and astronauts.</p><p>This is decidedly more sophisticated than the Alexa on your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Echo speaker</a>. Alexa will have access to the Orion spacecraft&#39;s telemetry data, answer &quot;thousands&quot; of mission-related questions and even control devices like cabin lighting. Amazon has finessed its algorithms to consider Orion&#39;s acoustics. Connectivity in space shouldn&#39;t be an issue, either. The Callisto technology payload carrying Alexa will both allow local voice control (even with no internet access) and access the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-australia-deep-space-station-upgrade-133000935.html">Deep Space Network</a> to provide news from home.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The initiative isn&#39;t just about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/in-2021-billionaires-headed-to-the-stars-210013764.html">bragging rights</a> or bringing a <em>Star Trek</em>-style computer to life. Amazon will use the lessons learned from Artemis I to improve Alexa both for future missions and for everyday users, particularly those who have little to no internet connectivity. The company is also adding new Alexa experiences that will give you access to Artemis I&#39;s telemetry, imagery, video (including the launch livestream) and notifications for key mission milestones.</p><p>Amazon is hoping to foster the next wave of space explorers in the process. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazonfutureengineer.com/space">introducing</a> an Alexa for Astronauts program that provides access to the virtual crew experience, digital tours of the Johnson Space Center and a STEM curriculum built withe the help of the National Science Teaching Association and Mobile CSP. The move helps Amazon burnish its reputation, of course, but it could be worthwhile if it encourages more students to pursue space industry careers.</p><div id="b5a686023cea4d79a0675b6a3fd97366"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWv0l4YPS1E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alexa-in-space-nasa-artemis-mission-143518042.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">54b48d7b-d53b-41e1-911a-b1f8251681de</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 14:35:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641392432</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T14:20:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b95c2bb0-6e2a-11ec-bbef-7f7b9337a21f" width="1920" height="1081" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b95c2bb0-6e2a-11ec-bbef-7f7b9337a21f" width="1920" height="1081" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alexa in the Callisto payload aboard NASA's Artemis I mission]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alexa in the Callisto payload aboard NASA's Artemis I mission]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Sony's CES 2022 keynote in under nine minutes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="c5f8cdb3c3a84c069ce7619e37693a35"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ANPka1CpwUg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Sony&#39;s CES 2022 press conference was jammed with information, as it revealed more details on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-reveals-playstation-vr-2-sense-controllers-023113499.html">PlayStation VR2</a> and plans to launch an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-vision-s-02-electric-suv-mobility-inc-071335668.html">electric car company</a>.

The sleek machine earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">score of 89</a> from us thanks in part to its fast performance and updated design, and now you can pick up the silver model for less at Amazon. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:24-inch iMac" href="https://amzn.to/3HIHxS1">24-inch iMac M1</a> with an 8-core CPU and a 7-core GPU, along with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, is down to $1,249, or $50 off its normal price. Only the silver model is this low right now, and the last time it saw a similar discount was back in July of last year.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HIHxS1" id="b5d8f40c32ad44ec89cfedbe1e9e8b2f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 24-inch iMac M1 at Amazon - $1,249</a><p>Apple&#39;s M1 chipset powers the latest iMacs, delivering noticeable performance improvements over previous models. The desktop can handle video editing, spreadsheet work and even Apple Arcade gaming without breaking a sweat, and wakes almost instantaneously from sleeping and only takes around 25 seconds to boot in a cold start. It also has a stunning 4.5K Retina Display that can show over one billion colors and reach up to 500 nits of brightness, so everything from photos to videos pops on this screen. Plus, the under-10-pound iMac is pretty easy to move around, so while you may just want to park it in one room of your home, you can move it when necessary without much effort.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Our biggest gripes with the iMac are its lack of vertical screen adjustment and its USB-C only port array. The base model, which is the one on sale, only has two USB-C ports — and you&#39;ll have to spring for the $1,499 8-core GPU version in order to get two more. That means that you&#39;ll most certainly be living the dongle life if you invest in this laptop, and that&#39;s an inconvenience that might be too much for some. You do get the color-matching Magic Mouse and Magic Keyboard with this desktop, though, and while there are more comfortable combos out there, they will work just fine for most people.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-24-inch-imac-m1-is-cheaper-than-ever-on-amazon-right-now-135540267.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">66e41088-b24f-4886-80ac-cb66be822c27</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:55:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641390536</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T13:48:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/f4fdb100-b752-11eb-ab79-10956a28523a" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/f4fdb100-b752-11eb-ab79-10956a28523a" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iMac M1 24-inch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iMac M1 24-inch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Walmart's InHome Delivery service will reach up to 30 million households in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Walmart has <a href="https://corporate.walmart.com/newsroom/2022/01/05/walmart-to-expand-inhome-delivery-reaching-30-million-u-s-homes-in-2022">big plans</a> for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-07-walmart-delivery-stock-fridge.html">InHome delivery service</a> in 2022, aiming to expand it from 6 million households to 30 million by the end of the year.

If your last one was “I can’t find a USB mic I like,” then 512 Audio might be about to ruin your (procrastinator’s) day. The company is unveiling two USB microphones at CES this year along with a podcast-friendly audio interface.</p><p>If you do (or plan on doing) a lot of vocal work, the $119 <a href="https://512audio.com/product/script">Script</a> microphone might be the one to consider. The vintage styling is based on Warm Audio’s WA-14 studio condenser microphone (512 Audio is a subsidiary of Warm). The Script is dual-pattern (Cardioid/Omni) and the dual 14mm capsules are tuned to vocal work, so the company claims. Thanks to its USB connection, the Script offers zero-latency monitoring via a headphone jack and onboard gain/mute controls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Should you want a microphone that’s a little more versatile, then the $160 <a href="https://512audio.com/product/tempest">Tempest</a> might be a better fit. Like the Script, there are onboard monitoring and volume controls. The Tempest also offers a larger, 34mm capsule, for those that want a more responsive sound. This model, too, is based on one of Warm’s existing microphones – specifically the <a href="https://warmaudio.com/wa47jr/">WA 47Jr</a>. Though we don’t know if these microphones are just USB versions of the ones they mimic or are simply visually inspired by them (at the very least, the WA14 offers more polar patterns than its 512 counterpart).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b55480c0-6e17-11ec-974b-01e8ef54786c" alt="512 Audio announces a new podcast-friendly audio interface." data-uuid="589eb87a-d979-31ab-96fa-008b12666210"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">512 Audio</div></figure><p>With both of the new microphones offering USB connectivity, you won’t need an interface to connect them to your PC, but 512 Audio is unveiling <a href="https://512audio.com/product/audio-interface">one of their own</a> for those that already have XLR microphones and want to plug them into something a little more podcast friendly than a generic interface.</p><p>While there’s no pricing information at this time, the audio interface has two combo ports for the aforementioned XLR mics and or ¼-inch instruments. There’s also a 3.5mm input for phones and other compatible devices. Perfect for introducing a “caller” onto your show or simply for feeding in other audio sources as you see fit. There are two headphone outputs on the front, which is a definite perk for podcasters and even a mute button for the mics which is less common than you might think, and handy in a podcast scenario for talking off-air or avoiding coughs and other unwanted sounds.</p><p>Of all the above, the Tempest will be launching first, slated for March this year. The Script will be available in “spring” and the audio interface will come later this year.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/512-audio-script-tempest-usb-microphones-130018337.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9253a5ac-2738-4de3-8e1a-5bde0645b33d</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 13:00:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641397685</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T15:48:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Microphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/94b46930-6e16-11ec-baee-15b80360569e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/94b46930-6e16-11ec-baee-15b80360569e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[512 Audio]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[512 Audio Script / Tempest USB microphones.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[512 Audio Script / Tempest USB microphones]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Sony reveals PlayStation VR2 specs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Of course, the year when many media outlets and companies decide to skip on attending CES in person, Sony decides this is the year to make some news at its press conference. While we got more news on its EV plans, and next-gen TVs, Tom Holland was also drafted into the showcase to promote the forthcoming Uncharted feature film.</p><p>Then it hit us with a barrage of specs for the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-reveals-playstation-vr-2-sense-controllers-023113499.html">next-gen PlayStation VR headset</a>. It will, of course, be compatible with the PS5 and the VR2 Sense controllers we’ve already seen. It will have a display resolution of 2,000 x 2,040 pixel per eye, a 110-degree field of view, and be capable of 90 to 120Hz frame rates, all while supporting 4K HDR.</p><p>The world of consumer VR has rocketed forward since the original PSVR, so Sony is playing catchup with features like inside-out tracking, which uses multiple embedded cameras to track the movements of your head and controllers. There will also be “headset feedback” which sounds like the headset will shake and vibrate like a DualShock/DualSense controller. We’re still waiting to see what it’ll look like, how much it’ll cost and when we’ll get to buy one, but the company did announce one of the first games arriving on the platform: <em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em>, which will be a VR experience set in the Horizon universe.</p><p>-Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-freestyle-portable-projector-auto-leveling-focus-023047886.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Samsung&#39;s portable Freestyle projector focuses and levels automatically</a></h2><h3>The floodlight-style device weighs just 1.83 lbs.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-freestyle-portable-projector-auto-leveling-focus-023047886.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/60f8c050-6e1b-11ec-9ddf-a73a1eb7a8b5" style="height:450;width:675;" alt="TMA" data-uuid="cb056b74-3b53-3ac2-a9ee-db5f21030d11"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure></a><p>Samsung&#39;s new portable projector uses autofocus and auto-leveling features that&#39;ll help align whatever you&#39;re watching, meaning you&#39;ll have a lot of options for where to place it.</p><p>You&#39;ll be able to project content at a display size ranging from 30 to 100 inches with a 1080p resolution.

These CPUs combine performance cores (P-cores) and efficient cores (E-cores) on a single chip to be able to better handle the demands of various real-world tasks. Their faster cores can power your game, for instance, while the slower cores are taking care of your livestreaming needs.

For gamers, it wraps around your field of view so you can see both ahead and beside you when playing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-game-of-the-year-edition-release-date-221249927.html">Flight Simulator</a>, for instance. But it can also be flipped 90 degrees into a portrait orientation for work, showing a Zoom feed, spreadsheets and whatever else you need to see.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/77769170-6dff-11ec-bff6-e6f71bb16267" alt="Samsung&#39;s curved 55-inch Odyssey Ark can work as a gigantic portrait display" data-uuid="d49f1e30-edb1-38a4-9e99-0da36c4a8db3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The Odyssey Ark is a Quantum Dot Mini LED display with a fairly sharp curvature and 16:9 aspect ratio, unlike the much wider 32:9 format of the 49-inch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-price-pre-order-020000540.html">Odyssey Neo G9</a>. It can pivot and tilt via the height adjustable stand (HAS), so you can set it to the optimal angle. That&#39;s pretty key, because it&#39;s so large when when tilted vertically that you have to crane your neck to see the top of the display.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It also offers multiview options that &quot;allow users to adjust Odyssey Ark exactly how they want it with a totally adaptable screen size to fit the game or the program without compromising its 4K display and bright, colorful images. The monitor also features a wireless, dial controller to manage lighting and the interface,&quot; Samsung wrote in a press release. Other specs like refresh rate, color accuracy, latency and more have yet to be revealed, but with Mini LED you can likely count on a reasonably bright, fast and color accurate monitor.&nbsp;</p><div id="b0d0035b32ef4814ada518f1997b08d9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here is a first look at the INSANE Odyssey Ark from <a href="https://twitter.com/Samsung?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Samsung</a>!

Suffice to say, it&#39;s pretty grandiose when in portrait mode, essentially working as a triple display with the top of it literally towering over the user. Samsung plans to bring it to the US in the second half of 2022, but has yet to reveal any pricing.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-55-inch-odyssey-ark-portrait-display-082359410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">db76a6e0-72c5-40cd-afa9-50cad9186590</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 08:23:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641391146</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T13:59:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db43f130-6df9-11ec-be87-afa388873cce" width="4000" height="2250" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db43f130-6df9-11ec-be87-afa388873cce" width="4000" height="2250" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung's curved 55-inch Odyssey Ark can work as a gigantic portrait display]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung's curved 55-inch Odyssey Ark can work as a gigantic portrait display]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
