The car soccer game for iOS and Android was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocket-league-sideswipe-mobile-game-ios-android-psyonix-173433198.html">revealed earlier in March</a> as a mobile, 2D version of <em>Rocket League</em> that lets you play solo or team up with a friend for two vs. two matches.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of the regular 3D <em>Rocket League</em> perspective, <em>Sideswipe</em> has a 2D side-on view, as the name suggests. It uses touch controls that are relatively easy to master, according to Psyonix, but will also offer advanced control mechanics for better players. As with the original, it will offer a ranking system for competitive modes with plenty of car customization options.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="788ccaf3c32c4d14b357573daa7cc662"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/leYd3809NNA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>As the game trailer above shows, it looks to capture the spirit of the original game and actually crosses over in one way. As the developer detailed, logging in with your Epic Games account for online matches will let you earn extra XP across both <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Sideswipe</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Every time you level up in <em>Sideswipe</em>, you&#39;ll earn a &#39;Bonus Win&#39; in <em>Rocket League</em>. Then, once you win an Online Match in <em>Rocket League</em>, you&#39;ll get extra XP for that Bonus Win. Bonus Wins can also be earned for <em>Sideswipe </em>by playing<em> Rocket League, </em>so enjoy the extra XP in both games,&quot; Psyonix wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Psyonix no doubt launched Rocket League Sideswipe in Oceania (Australia, Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia)  to shake out any bugs, but confirmed that the game will launch globally before the end of the year. So far, however, it has yet to provide any details for a further rollout.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rocket-league-sideswipe-for-mobile-has-launched-into-pre-season-073500710.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83840e08-deed-402c-8307-5863a2067efb</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 07:35:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637047216</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T07:20:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/be09b500-46a8-11ec-bf3f-392cebe17d3b" width="1200" height="630" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/be09b500-46a8-11ec-bf3f-392cebe17d3b" width="1200" height="630" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Psyonix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Rocket League Sideswipe' for mobile has launched into pre-season]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Rocket League Sideswipe' for mobile has launched into pre-season]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alexa can now 'Play Something' on Netflix if you ask it to]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-play-something-shuffle-play-feature-160057616.html">launched</a> Play Something earlier this year as a way to help viewers who may be suffering from decision fatigue and just want to watch anything that may suit their taste at the end of the day. Now, viewers can even <a href="https://amazonfiretv.blog/alexa-play-something-on-netflix-e8d8f4fe5115">ask Alexa</a> to do it for them. Customers in the US and Canada with a Fire TV can simply say &quot;Alexa, Play Something on Netflix,&quot; and the streaming service will put on a show or a movie that they might like, depending on what they&#39;ve been watching on the platform.</p><p>They can use their Fire TV remote to issue a voice command like usual. But if they have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-2021-update-omni-fire-tv-4-series-130041393.html">Omni series</a> Fire TV, which was just released back in September, they can issue the command completely hands-free. Charlotte Maines, Director of Fire TV, said in a statement:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Over the past 12 months, we’ve seen that Fire TV customers that used voice engaged with content almost twice as much as those who didn’t.

According to the <a href="https://apnews.com/article/space-exploration-science-business-697f5aa719331ab6e74102ebb06b52d8?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"><em>Associated Press</em></a>, US Space Command started tracking the space junk in the early hours of the morning. The situation saw the station pass the debris field every 90 minutes, forcing those on board to close and reopen several compartments multiple times throughout the day. The four American, one German and two Russian astronauts aboard the ISS will need to stay on alert for the next several days.</p><p>&quot;Thanks for a crazy but well-coordinated day, we really appreciated all the situational awareness you gave us,&quot; US astronaut Mark Vande Hei told NASA mission control before he and the other crew members aboard went to bed at 12PM EST.  &quot;It was certainly a great way to bond as a crew, starting off our very first workday in space.&quot; Four of the astronauts arrived at the station late last week.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d5c44e2b9abe4462835e785faffa69f5"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The U.S. State Department confirms and condemns that Russia conducted an anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) test in low Earth orbit.<br><br>Full statement: <a href="https://t.co/2WIUuWV6Mh">pic.twitter.com/2WIUuWV6Mh</a></p>— Michael Sheetz (@thesheetztweetz) <a href="https://twitter.com/thesheetztweetz/status/1460330386085531649?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 15, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Neither NASA nor the US government has said what created the debris field that put the ISS in danger. However, later in the day, the US State Department condemned a Russian missile test that destroyed one of the country’s own satellites and created more than 1,500 trackable pieces of orbital debris. “The test will significantly increase the risk to astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station, as well as to other human spaceflight activities,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price said. “Russia’s dangerous and irresponsible behavior jeopardizes the long term sustainability of outer space and clearly demonstrates that Russia’s claims of opposing the weaponization of space are disingenuous and hypocritical.”</p><p>The State Department said the US would work with its allies to respond to Russia’s act. Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-reports-debris-generating-event-outer-space-2021-11-15/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the country has yet to comment on the incident.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Along with their partners, NASA and Russia’s Roscosmos space agency frequently move the International Space Station to avoid incoming space junk.

With its long and storied history in human spaceflight, it is unthinkable that Russia would endanger not only the American and international partner astronauts on the ISS, but also their own cosmonauts. Their actions are reckless and dangerous, threatening as well the Chinese space station and the taikonauts on board.&quot;</p><p>“All nations have a responsibility to prevent the purposeful creation of space debris from ASATs and to foster a safe, sustainable space environment,&quot; he continued. “NASA will continue monitoring the debris in the coming days and beyond to ensure the safety of our crew in orbit.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/international-space-station-debris-field-215745675.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c232c067-6f28-4955-ac46-bcb6ab9f87a4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 21:57:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637020330</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T23:52:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/35c1a9f0-465d-11ec-bff7-25df01936713" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/35c1a9f0-465d-11ec-bff7-25df01936713" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[European Space Agency]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[International Space Station]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[International Space Station]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat is adding TikTok-like AR music lenses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snap has signed a music licensing deal with Sony Music Entertainment.

Highlights include the entire Max Payne series and F.E.A.R franchise, in addition to <em>Skate 2 </em>and <em>Star Wars: Jedi Knight II. </em></p><p>Every title Microsoft is adding today will support Auto HDR on Xbox Series X and Series S consoles. You&#39;ll also see an increase in resolution when playing original Xbox games. The Xbox Series X and Xbox One X will render those titles at four times their native resolution, while the Xbox Series S will do so at three times and Xbox One S and Xbox One at double. Additionally, 11 titles will support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-s-fps-boost-backwards-compatible-170055413.html">FPS Boost</a>. The feature increases the framerate of a game up to 60 frames per second. 26 titles that were already a part of the backward compatibility library will now support FPS Boost as well. Included in that list are <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, <em>The Elder Scrolls IV, Dragon Age: Origins </em>and<em> Dead Space 2.  </em>&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before today, the last time Microsoft added any new titles to the backward compatibility program was in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-10-xbox-backward-compatibility-scarlett.html">2019</a>. At the time, that was supposed to be the end of the road for the initiative. Now, Microsoft says this is the final update. &quot;While we continue to stay focused on preserving and enhancing the art form of games, we have reached the limit of our ability to bring new games to the catalog from the past due to licensing, legal and technical constraints,&quot; Xbox Compatibility Program Lead Peggy Lo said. Hopefully the final list of approximately 700 games includes some of your favorite titles.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-backward-compatability-76-games-annoucement-185623778.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">33903a1f-a6de-48dd-9de3-ec0e75c4b827</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 18:56:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637002588</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T18:56:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9776d2b0-4644-11ec-8f7b-372b8a9ebab2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9776d2b0-4644-11ec-8f7b-372b8a9ebab2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Xbox Backward compatibility program]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Xbox Backward compatibility program]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Halo Infinite's free multiplayer mode is available now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rumors started swirling over the last few days that Microsoft will release the free <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/halo%20infinite/"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> multiplayer mode before the full game.

Before this week, companies like Mozilla and Brave had planned to implement similar workarounds to allow users to open Start menu results in their respective browsers, but now won&#39;t be able to do so.</p><p>When the block first appeared in an <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/11/12/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-346-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/">early preview build of Windows 11</a> last week, it looked like it was added by mistake. However, on Monday, the company confirmed it intentionally closed the loophole.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Windows openly enables applications and services on its platform, including various web browsers,” a spokesperson for Microsoft told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782802/microsoft-block-edgedeflector-windows-11?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>. “At the same time, Windows also offers certain end-to-end customer experiences in both Windows 10 and Windows 11, the search experience from the taskbar is one such example of an end-to-end experience that is not designed to be redirected. When we become aware of improper redirection, we issue a fix.”</p><p>Daniel Aleksandersen, the developer of EdgeDeflector, was quick to criticize the move. “These aren’t the actions of an attentive company that cares about its product anymore,” he said in a <a href="https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/microsoft-edge-protocol-competition.html"><ins>blog post</ins></a>. “Microsoft isn’t a good steward of the Windows operating system. They’re prioritizing ads, bundleware, and service subscriptions over their users’ productivity.”</p><p>Mozilla was similarly critical of Microsoft. “People deserve choice. They should have the ability to simply and easily set defaults and their choice of default browser should be respected,” a spokesperson for the company told <em>The Verge</em>. “We have worked on code that launches Firefox when the microsoft-edge protocol is used for those users that have already chosen Firefox as their default browser. Following the recent change to Windows 11, this planned implementation will no longer be possible.”</p><p>Other than the fact Microsoft should let Edge speak for itself, the company’s behavior here raises a question about its priorities. Windows 11 does not make it easy to switch your default browser. Someone shouldn’t have to go through the trouble of telling Windows they want to use a different browser only for the operating system to show them webpages in one they specifically decided they don’t want to use.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-edge-deflector-block-171516494.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">33edaa07-7844-44a6-8a77-37d1663284f3</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 17:15:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636995683</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T17:01:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/65f7cef0-098d-11eb-be39-360be473205e" width="1734" height="1046" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/65f7cef0-098d-11eb-be39-360be473205e" width="1734" height="1046" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Edge]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A look back at the strengths of the OG Xbox on its 20th birthday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>20 years ago today, the original Xbox was released. It’s a pretty big milestone for the entire gaming industry, because it’s hard to imagine console gaming without Xbox today. But back then it was pretty risky — Microsoft was the first American firm to release a gaming system in eight years, and the company wasn’t really well-known for being a game developer or publisher outside of the Flight Simulator series and built-in Windows games like <em>Solitaire</em> and <em>Minesweeper</em>.</p><p>Admittedly, the Xbox brand didn’t really take off until the release of the 360 in 2005. But the OG Xbox made a pretty good showing for its first try, thanks to a solid lineup of games and no thanks to its enormous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-23-xbox-controller-retrospective-hyperkin-duke-gamepad.html">Duke</a> controller. Today a few Engadget staffers would like to chime in with their cherished Xbox memories, ones that really highlight the strength of Microsoft’s first outing in the console world.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h3>Strength #1: System Link</h3><p><strong><em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em></strong></p><div id="22c34445318447beae55111c2319646b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KpYzz5YCQ1I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>A year before Xbox Live launched and redefined console gaming forever, there was the multiplayer of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Halo: Combat Evolved" href="https://fave.co/3nfmgYG"><em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em></a>. It sounds archaic today: there were no such things as online play, bots or centralized player accounts. But there was System Link, an Xbox feature that allowed multiple consoles to connect together for offline LAN parties. Together with <em>Halo&#39;s</em> four-player split-screen support, System Link allowed up to 16 players to battle it out.</p><p>In many ways, <em>Halo&#39;s</em> multiplayer was the logical evolution of <em>Goldeneye</em>, the first console shooter to enthrall a generation of gamers. And while System Link may sound like a pain to set up, it was perfectly suited to large networks, like the one at my college. That&#39;s how I found myself spending hours with my roommates, huddled in front of a basic 20-inch TV, learning the intricacies of <em>Halo&#39;s</em> combat. I never quite mastered the three-shot kill — two in the center, one in the head — but I got close.</p><p>I can recall one heated match as if it was a war story. My team and I were huddled in the middle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_Gulch">Blood Gulch</a>, one of <em>Halo&#39;s</em> iconic maps featuring a long canyon with two bases at each end. The scores were neck-and-neck, never more than a few kills leading on either side. All seemed lost. We were sitting ducks in No Man&#39;s Land, with only the protection of a few hills in front of us. I had a sniper rifle, but very little ammo. In a moment of desperation, I poked my head up and, miraculously, took an enemy out in front of their base. When another person popped up, I was able to headshot them with the same clip. Game over.</p><p>I later learned that someone from the opposing team threw a chair against a wall when they lost. I can&#39;t imagine an online match with some randos provoking the same sort of visceral response. That&#39;s just <em>Halo </em>multiplayer, baby. No internet required. — <em>Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em></p><h3>Strength #2: PC ports</h3><p><strong><em>Morrowind</em></strong></p><div id="e5f4af1edc9241498c789e19fe220e2f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhP49PlN6HY?rel=0&amp;start=48" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>I have a confession to make: I’m not much of a console gamer. Coming from the former Yugoslavia, where Nintendo products were exorbitantly expensive, the one constant in my gaming life has always been the PC. While other kids in Canada, where my family eventually settled, grew up on <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, my favorite childhood games were <em>Warcraft: Orcs and Humans</em>, <em>Dune II</em> and <em>The Secret of Monkey Island.</em></p><p>So when Microsoft released the Xbox in 2001, I wasn’t excited for it until the release of Bethesda’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Xbox;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind" href="https://fave.co/323H8tM"><em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</em></a> in 2002. I didn’t own an Xbox, but my best friend did. At the time, neither of us had a PC capable of running <em>Morrowind</em> at a playable framerate. So when he bought a copy of the game, one of the first things I did was come over to watch him create his first character. Mind you, we played countless hours of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> together, but <em>Morrowind </em>was the game that consistently ignited our imaginations.</p><p>To this day, we talk about some of the ways he managed to break the game. For example, he eventually became the leader of both House Hlaalu and Telvanni. And at one point, he received a quest to assassinate a Hlaalu landholder. He travelled to the estate only to find out he was its owner, so there was no way for him to finish the quest. By modern standards, that’s janky design, but it’s those quirks that made me fall in love with <em>Morrowind</em> and The Elder Scrolls series at large. — <em>Igor Bonifacic, Contributing Editor</em></p><h3>Strength #3: Exclusives</h3><p><strong><em>Jet Set Radio Future</em></strong></p><div id="1a23e07c98024b989745d6506bf1f0ee"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZId5O3dbYJw?rel=0&amp;start=39" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>My time with the original Xbox was limited, and I remember looking at games like <em>Halo</em> and <em>Fable</em> with awe. And the fact that it got a lot of games that would normally only be on PC — like <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> — was also swoon-worthy. But then and now, there was really only one reason I wanted an Xbox, and that was to play <em>Jet Set Radio Future</em>.</p><p>The original game, <em>Jet Grind Radio</em>, was probably one of my favorite Dreamcast titles at the time. I loved the look of it, the gameplay and oh, the soundtrack. Especially the soundtrack. But when the Dreamcast was discontinued, it left some great franchises stranded. Games that Microsoft was perfectly happy to pick up for its foray into the console market, like <em>Shenmue</em> and my beloved <em>Jet Grind Radio</em>, which was switched back to its Japanese monkier for the sequel here in the US.</p><p>The gameplay remained mostly the same, with your skaters tasked with spray painting walls with their tags, battling against other gangs and avoiding the police. But <em>Future</em> also dispensed with time limits and enclosed stages, allowing you to skate between one section and the next. And the soundtrack, of course, was a banger. Guitar Vader, Cibo Matto and Bis. (Okay, maybe I’m the only person who cares about Bis. They wrote <em>The Powerpuff Girls</em> end theme! &#39;Social Dancing&#39; is a great album!) — <em>Kris Naudus, Buyer&#39;s Guide Editor</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-20th-anniversary-170016982.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c01f717d-f94d-479b-9e26-8d1f70d2b127</guid><dc:creator>Engadget</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 17:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637022554</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T00:29:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Engadget]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3426e150-463f-11ec-95d7-52c8a77ed51c" width="2000" height="1208" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3426e150-463f-11ec-95d7-52c8a77ed51c" width="2000" height="1208" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Evan-Amos / Engagdet]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Xbox]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Xbox]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Peacock will debut in the UK and Ireland on November 16th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sky/"><ins>Sky TV</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/now%20tv/"><ins>NOW</ins></a> subscribers in the UK and Ireland will <a href="https://www.skygroup.sky/en-gb/article/peacock-european-rollout-begins-on-sky"><ins>soon have access</ins></a> to many more shows and movies and no extra cost.

That&#39;s something I&#39;ve always dreamed of, but it wasn&#39;t possible when I was renting in Brooklyn. These days, though, I&#39;ve got a bit more freedom in my own home outside of Atlanta. And now that my wife and I are also responsible for a precocious three-year-old, we figured it was a good time to move away from the tyranny of house keys. The last thing we need is to be locked out during a potty emergency.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You&#39;ve got a few different options: electronic locks with key pads or biometrics, or smart ones that can be controlled via apps. Initially, we were turned off by the latter. Given just how finicky connected devices are plus the potential for remote hacking, app-controlled locks just didn&#39;t seem worth the trouble. So we opted for a well-rated electronic lock with a touchscreen pin pad: <a href="https://amzn.to/3ktxmqY">Yale&#39;s Assure Lock</a>. It&#39;s a sturdy Grade 2 deadbolt with a key slot, which is helpful if the battery runs out. It also <a href="https://amzn.to/3kvIyDG">has an upgrade port for turning it into an August smart lock</a> down the line. (Spoiler: that turned out to be very useful.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b02f441-4625-11ec-9cef-691f1a35c4e6" alt="Yale Assure Lock" data-uuid="4dea7d79-d415-3c6d-9afc-5b9fb6a1d996"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Installing the Assure Lock on our front door entailed the same process as any other deadbolt. We removed the old lock, installed the included strike plate and took care to make sure the Assure aligned with our door frame properly. It took a bit of fiddling, but eventually my wife was able to wiggle it into place. (And here&#39;s where I&#39;ll admit that my role in this installation process came mostly in the form of cheerleading, instruction-reading and drink-fetching. I&#39;m the tech guy; my wife enjoys getting her hands dirty with house projects whenever possible.)</p><p>Setting up our PIN was a bit more cumbersome, since it involved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_5zM2-u_eU&amp;t=125s">following very specific instructions</a> from Yale. It&#39;s not tough, but it&#39;s not exactly intuitive either. I immediately dreaded having to repeat that process whenever we need to set up guest codes. Once we had everything configured, the Assure Lock worked like a charm. I could run to the park with my daughter without fretting about keys, and punching in numbers was simple enough that she was eager to help out. (Gotta get that math training in whenever possible, right?)</p><p>While the Assure’s design didn’t bother me much, it’s definitely larger than most deadbolt facades. It practically announces itself as a high tech gadget. Partially, that’s because it still has room for a traditional key. Yale’s <a href="https://amzn.to/3D5CU2l">Assure Lock SL</a> omits that entirely, and is therefore more compact. So if your aesthetics don’t align with mine, don’t worry, you have options.</p><p>Even though the Assure worked well as a keypad lock, I still couldn&#39;t help but feel the pull towards something smarter. I wanted an easier way to open our front door remotely while we were playing in the backyard. And I realized it&#39;d be useful to know if the lock was open or not from my phone, something that would come in handy whenever we had a cat sitter visiting while we were away. So within a week, we installed <a href="https://amzn.to/3Hal9kZ">Yale&#39;s smart lock upgrade kit</a> and never looked back.</p><p>We still use the Assure&#39;s keypad most of the time, but it&#39;s been genuinely helpful having a bit more connectivity. Now I can easily change guest codes on the fly, and being able to confirm it&#39;s closed remotely is a much needed balm for my anxious dad brain. We&#39;ve avoided activating Alexa integration — voice control seems like an unnecessary security risk — and we haven&#39;t yet connected the Assure to our HomeKit setup. Once we do, though, we’ll be able to see the Yale Lock alongside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">our Arlo cameras</a> on a single screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b01bbc0-4625-11ec-9f36-499846b235e6" alt="Yale Assure Lock" data-uuid="043a7898-41ee-3945-b403-85a2435f695b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Despite living the smart lock life, I can understand why many people still find them untrustworthy. If there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned about smart home tech over the years, it&#39;s that it can all be pretty dumb at times. Security flaws may pop up, the connectivity may fail. But when it comes to security,  I&#39;m not too worried about someone trying to hack into my home.&nbsp;</p><p>But even if you don&#39;t want a connected lock, it&#39;s still worth upgrading to an electronic lock with a keypad. After loving the convenience of the Yale Assure so much, we added a simpler model to a rear door, which was a huge help while doing yardwork. Just think about the last time you were locked out. Or, if you&#39;ve somehow been blessed never to experience that, imagine how annoying being locked out in the cold can be. Maybe it happens at the end of a long day, or at a point when you just <em>really </em>need to use the bathroom. If you had an electronic lock, you&#39;d be inside your home already.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/yale-assure-smart-lock-gadget-irl-153534460.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f9b0149-556b-468e-a053-b03efd277c2e</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 15:35:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637002693</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T18:58:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b02f440-4625-11ec-bffb-321cb42cd6b9" width="2000" height="1265" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0b02f440-4625-11ec-bffb-321cb42cd6b9" width="2000" height="1265" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Yale Assure Lock]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Yale Assure Lock]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Take-Two buys 'OlliOlli World' developer Roll7]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Take-Two/">Take-Two Interactive</a>, the owner of Rockstar Games and 2K, has added another studio to its roster. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/roll7/">Roll7</a>, the small team behind the OlliOlli skateboarding series, is <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/news-releases/news-release-details/private-division-acquires-developer-roll7">joining</a> the company&#39;s Private Division publishing label.</p><p>Private Division will release Roll7&#39;s next game, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/olliolli-world-preview-interview-e3-160000184.html"><em>OlliOlli World</em></a>, in the first quarter of 2022.

Ever since the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-85t-review-130035415.html">Elite 85t</a> came out, we&#39;ve seen the 75t oscillate in price — but Best Buy has them for only $80 right now, which is the best price we&#39;ve seen.

The 75t are small and comfortable, and they&#39;re IP55-rated design means you can wear them while exercising without worrying. Each bud has one button for onboard controls, but they do a lot including adjust volume, turn on HearThrough transparency mode, skip tracks, mute mics when you&#39;re on a call and more. The buds have solid audio that packs a punch and, after the Elite 85t came out, Jabra updated the 75t with active noise cancelling through a firmware update. That was one of the biggest features previously missing on the 75t, and the addition of it makes these buds even more like the 85ts than they were before.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You&#39;ll get roughly 6.5 hours on a single charge of the Elite 75t, plus the extra juice its charging case holds.

Luckily, the 85t are on sale right now as well for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$150" href="https://amzn.to/3Dlpuzc">$150</a> — that&#39;s their lowest price ever, but still almost double the cost of the 75t right now.

It&#39;s moving forward with at least one of them, an autonomous vehicle that can go off road. Honda and engineering company Black &amp; Veatch have been putting the second-gen Autonomous Work Vehicle (AWV) through its paces at a solar panel construction site.</p><p>This was the first field test in which several AWVs were working together. The vehicles towed trailers and carried construction materials, water and other supplies across the 1,000-acre worksite. The AWV can carry a payload of up to 399kg (880 pounds) and tow a trailer with a total weight of 750kg (1,653 pounds).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a video that shows off the AWVs, a Black &amp; Veatch employee notes that it can take a while to travel across such a large site. So loading up the vehicles with materials and sending them to another location can make things more efficient and cut down on employees&#39; travel time, freeing them up to work on other things.</p><div id="546f567fbb9f4fe6b351ed05b38d5d4d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BRtGYnBNG7U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/honda/">Honda</a> created a high-definition map of the site so operators could set start and end points for the AWVs. It says the vehicles stopped within centimeters of their destinations. Along with operating autonomously, the AWV can be remotely controlled.</p><p>The company claims the vehicle can run for up to eight hours on a single charge, even in a high-temperature environment. The AWV uses a number of sensors for navigation, including GPS, radar and LiDAR, as well as 3D cameras for remote monitoring. Honda says that even with a maximum payload capacity, the AWV has a range of up to 27.9 miles, depending on the use case.</p><p>The automaker is aiming to improve the performance and design of the AMV as it iterates on the prototype (it looks kinda cute as is). It might offer the ability to add attachments and tools as well. Honda hasn&#39;t revealed plans to release a commercial version of the AMV just yet, though.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honda-autonomous-work-vehicle-demo-021556762.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">582f08ac-3aa1-472a-beb9-d9fb70c6f2eb</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 15 Nov 2021 14:15:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636986848</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T14:34:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0198f7f0-4621-11ec-b3da-154bd068d35b" width="1855" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0198f7f0-4621-11ec-b3da-154bd068d35b" width="1855" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Honda]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honda's new 'Autonomous Work Vehicle' parked on the side of a dirt road.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honda 'Autonomous Work Vehicle']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TD Pilot will let people with disabilities control iPads with their eyes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-os-15-public-beta-preview-191514417.html">plenty new in iPadOS 15</a>, but it also features an under-sung accessibility upgrade: support for third-party eye-tracking devices. That&#39;ll allow people with disabilities to use iPad apps and speech generation software simply through eye movements — no touchscreen interaction required. Tobii Dynavox, the assistive tech division of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-13-tobii-vr-eye-tracking.html">eye-tracking company Tobii</a>, worked with Apple for years to help make that happen. And now, the firm is ready to announce TD Pilot, a device that aims to bring the iPad experience to the estimated 50 million people globally who need communication assistance.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="1b92b976-ec30-43e2-a8a4-0a73dc54fcc7"/><p>The TD Pilot is basically a super-powered frame for Apple&#39;s tablets: It can fit in something as big as the iPad Pro 12.9-inch, and it also packs in large speakers, an extended battery and a wheelchair mount. It&#39;s thankfully water and dust-resistant, so it&#39;ll survive time in a rainstorm or even a user&#39;s shower.  There&#39;s also a secondary &quot;Partner Window&quot; on the back that spells out what a TD Pilot user is saying, which aims to make conversation feel more natural. Most importantly, though, it features Tobii Dynavox&#39;s latest eye-tracking sensor, which is powerful enough to work in bright sunlight.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="9281512adf654436955e43639e52c4d8"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nfZ0ntD4grQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>This isn&#39;t exactly new territory for the company: It&#39;s been producing <a href="https://www.tobiidynavox.com/pages/i-series-ap">popular Windows-powered assistive devices</a> for years. But, as CEO Fredrik Ruben tells Engadget, TD Pilot gives users with disabilities the same sort of flexibility that the non-disabled have. Some may not need the full power of a Windows PC, or maybe they&#39;d just rather deal with the simpler interface on an iPad. TD Pilot users will also be able use eye tracking to play some iPadOS games—so long as they don&#39;t require extremely rapid movement.</p><p>While Tobii Dynavox is the current market leader in eye-tracking solutions, a smaller company ended up delivering iPad support first. <a href="https://www.inclusivetlc.com/skyle-for-ipad-pro">Inclusive Technology&#39;s Skyle</a> launched last year, and it allows for gaze control by tapping into the iPad&#39;s Assistive Touch feature. That was originally meant for mice and other input devices. Consequently, Ruben claims that technique is more like emulated tracking, since it involves staring at a cursor to move it around. Still,<a href="http://products%20for%20pals%20-%20als%20tech/"> a short review</a> from the YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5Y80QSdvJ1cdOyZRM73U3A">Products for pALS</a> was pretty favorable (and also had some less kind things to say about Tobii Dynavox&#39;s dated software).</p><div id="76b1c54459ef4f7baf9762dc009c474e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_3TxZtDJpFo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Skyle&#39;s $2,995 price may also be another advantage if your insurance doesn&#39;t cover TD Pilot. Ruben tells us that Tobii Dynavox has around 400 insurance contracts already, and its devices are already covered by Medicare and Medicaid. Without insurance, though, the total cost of the TD Pilot could run up to $10,000, not including the cost of the iPad.

You can grab the cans for $279 right now, or $50 off their normal price. That&#39;s the best price we&#39;ve seen in the short time these headphones have been available, so now&#39;s a good time to get them if you&#39;ve had your eye on a new pair of headphones or if someone on your gift list could use them.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Dno7Ab" id="4bf5941782e54770acdc88026724cfe8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Bose QuietComfort 45 at Amazon - $279</a><p>Bose&#39;s QuietComfort lineup is beloved for many reasons and the company didn&#39;t try to reinvent the wheel here. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-45-review-143031637.html">QC45</a> look very similar to the QC35 that came before it. We recommend the Bose 700 if you&#39;re looking for a striking pair of headphones, but the QC45, while not the slickest, are super comfortable to wear for hours on end. The physical buttons for onboard controls let you play/pause, take calls, skip tracks and adjust the volume, plus switch between active noise cancellation and ambient sound mode. Notably, Bose nixed the micro-USB charging port and opted for a more modern USB-C port on these cans.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sound quality and ANC are as good as you&#39;d expect on a pair of Bose headphones. Audio is clear and balanced and ANC is even better than it was before. QuietComfort devices have been some of the best you can get if you want to block out the world, and Bose managed to improve upon it even more in the QC45 with the help of multiple microphones that work with a &quot;proprietary digital chip&quot; to detect and silence more mid-range frequencies. That means it&#39;ll quell the roar of the commuter train you may be riding along with the voices of colleagues on Zoom calls right next to you.</p><p>Bose promises up to 24 hours of battery life on a single charge and we got around 22.5 hours in our testing. That means you&#39;ll be able to keep these cans on all day long if you want and still have some juice leftover at the end of a work day. As solid as these headphones are, they do have a few flaws. We mentioned their somewhat boring design, but that&#39;s easy to overlook thanks to the QC45&#39;s comfort level. You can&#39;t adjust EQ yourself, but the cans have volume-optimized Active EQ feature that adjusts highs and lows automatically. They also have a feature that lets you connect them to your phone and laptop at the same time, but they don&#39;t automatically reconnect to your second device after taking a call from your phone. It&#39;s a small issue, but one that&#39;s amplified when you consider other headphones in this price range do this automatically. However, if you&#39;re looking for the best that Bose has to offer — especially in the ANC department — this deal on the QC45 is one to consider.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.
