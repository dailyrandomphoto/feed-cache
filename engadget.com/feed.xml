Logitech might have a more viable alternative for some people, however. It just <a href="https://logi.link/q8uhac">introduced</a> an MX Keys Mini wireless keyboard that shrinks the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-04-logitech-mx-master-3-mx-keys-hands-on.html">original MX Keys</a> design into a tiny, minimalist footprint.</p><p>The MX Keys Mini doesn&#39;t include a number pad or other perks from a full-size keyboard, but it does preserve the &quot;Perfect Stroke&quot; system that combines non-mechanical switches with dished keys that can improve your typing accuracy. There are even a few new functions you won&#39;t get in the larger keyboard, including a dictation key for Macs and Windows PCs, a microphone mute toggle and an emoji key.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Mini supports Android, ChromeOS, Linux, iOS and iPadOS using either Bluetooth or a USB receiver, with pairing for up to three devices. USB-C fast charging will help if you need a few more hours of typing in a pinch.</p><p>The MX Keys Mini is available now <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:for $100" href="https://fave.co/3hzINNb">for $100</a> in dark gray, pink and silver colors. That&#39;s not a huge drop from the $130 price of the full MX Keys, but it&#39;s on par with the no-frills Magic Keyboard. It&#39;s arguably a better buy if you prefer the ergonomics of Logitech&#39;s keyboard, don&#39;t like the feel of mechanicals or just want a keyboard you can easily shuffle between platforms.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-keys-mini-keyboard-070128945.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a0958c8-de20-4fad-b9a7-2cb0388dbd10</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 07:01:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632411704</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T15:41:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ce75dad0-1c7e-11ec-bfec-eab60949ca08" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ce75dad0-1c7e-11ec-bfec-eab60949ca08" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Logitech]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Logitech MX Keys Mini keyboard]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Logitech MX Keys Mini keyboard]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook's 2Africa to become the longest subsea cable in the world]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>2Africa, a subsea cable project funded by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-safety-research-212546087.html">Facebook</a> and several telcos, will become the longest subsea cable system ever deployed by the time it&#39;s finished. The social network has announced that the consortium of companies behind the initiative has decided to add a new segment to the structure called 2Africa Pearls, which will connect Africa, Europe and Asia.&nbsp;</p><p>When Facebook first announced the project, it said 2Africa will lay down 37,000 km (22,990 miles) of cables on the ocean floor. Last month, the company also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/16/facebook-adds-four-new-branches-to-its-2africa-subsea-cable-network/">announced</a> that the consortium is extending the cable&#39;s reach to four more branches in Seychelles, the Comoros Islands, Angola and the south-eastern part of Nigeria.

While the original 2Africa project was only meant to provide connectivity to 1.2 billion people, the addition of Pearls would allow the cable to serve a total of 3 billion people. He wrote:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The past 18 months have highlighted the importance of connectivity as billions of people around the world rely on the internet to work, attend school, and stay connected to people they care about. We continue to invest in subsea cables in Africa and beyond, as communities and businesses flourish when there is widely accessible internet.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-2-africa-longest-subsea-cable-in-the-world-070058568.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">56369d48-82b4-472c-8722-8e0327cb035f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 07:00:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632812117</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T06:55:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb911c70-2024-11ec-bb63-97c6c5bf26de" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb911c70-2024-11ec-bb63-97c6c5bf26de" width="1600" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[2Africa]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[2Africa]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[2Africa]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Meet is testing live translated captions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-meet-webcam-brightness-web-155518924.html">Google Meet&#39;s</a> latest beta feature could help make video conferences with foreign clients, partners, students and employees go more smoothly.

One potential savior was Microsoft, which had negotiated to acquire the app in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-not-buying-tiktok-233257859.html">lost its bid to Oracle</a>. At the <a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021">Code conference</a>, CEO Satya Nadella offered new details on the negotiation, telling journalist Kara Swisher it was &quot;the strangest thing I&#39;ve ever worked on,&quot; <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2021/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-calls-failed-tiktok-talks-strangest-thing-ive-ever-worked/"><em>Geekwire</em></a> has reported.</p><p>It was a chaotic series of events that started when Trump threatened to force Chinese company ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US owner, citing privacy and security concerns. Microsoft stepped in as a potential buyer, though the company in the end struck a deal with Oracle and Walmart that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-oracle-walmart-sale-shelved-142133736.html">scrapped</a> by President Joe Biden&#39;s administration in February 2021.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>TikTok originally came to Microsoft, Nadella emphasized, seeking a cloud and security partner to help it pilot the delicate political landscape between China and the US. &quot;That&#39;s kind of how it started,&quot; he said. &quot;But I was pretty intrigued. I must say, it&#39;s a great property. Obviously, everyone has seen that growth and what have you, and I guess the rest is history.&quot;</p><p>In fact, just yesterday, TikTok reached <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-tiktok-1-billion-monthly-active-users-154034999.html">a billion users</a> and did so in less than four years. For perspective, it took Instagram almost eight years after its initial release and nearly six years after it was acquired by Facebook in 2012 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-20-instagram-1-billion-users.html">pass the 1 billion user threshold</a>.</p><blockquote><p>President Trump, I think had sort of a particular point of view on what he was trying to get done there, and then just dropped off,” he said. “I mean, it was interesting. There was a period of time when I felt that the [administration] had some particular set of requirements, and then they just disappeared.</p></blockquote><p>Swisher persisted with the subject, asking Nadella about Microsoft&#39;s negotiations with Trump. “President Trump, I think had sort of a particular point of view on what he was trying to get done there, and then just dropped off,” he said. “I mean, it was interesting. There was a period of time when I felt that the [administration] had some particular set of requirements, and then they just disappeared.”</p><p>In fact, Microsoft was in the middle of negotiations with ByteDance when Trump dropped a bomb, telling reporters that he&#39;d rather ban the app than allow it to be sold to a US company, according to a book by Microsoft President Brad Smith. That &quot;threw into disarray the careful negotiations we had pursued with ByteDance” to buy TikTok’s business in the U.S. and the three other countries, he wrote. Trump only relented and allowed a deal to happen after Nadella called him personally.</p><p>After Oracle&#39;s winning bid, ByteDance said that Trump had &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-trump-oracle-walmart-155348189.html">ghosted</a>&quot; the site, effectively going silent after ordering the company to divest its US TikTok assets.</p><p>Though it came away empty-handed, Microsoft did learn a few things about complex foreign negotiations around tech. &quot;It’s possible to run a foreign technology service in a domestic data center with strict security, privacy, and digital safety controls in a manner that provides appropriate transparency to local government officials,&quot; said Smith.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-calls-tik-tok-deal-strangest-thing-ive-ever-worked-on-052616118.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">631c6caa-a498-457f-b151-41c8f7b2506c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 05:26:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632806768</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T05:26:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0f19e090-201c-11ec-bcb4-b30e56a2829e" width="2310" height="1686" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0f19e090-201c-11ec-bcb4-b30e56a2829e" width="2310" height="1686" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anushree Fadnavis / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Satya Nadella, Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft, gestures as he attends Microsoft's 'Young Innovators' Summit' in New Delhi, India February 26, 2020.

His comments come more than 10 days after <em>The Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline">published</a> an investigation into how Instagram affects the teens who use it. Citing internal research conducted by Facebook, <em>The Journal</em> wrote that “Instagram is harmful for a sizable percentage” of teens, particularly teenage girls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The investigation prompted immediate pushback from lawmakers, many of whom were already wary of Facebook’s handling of child safety, and its plans to build a version of its service for children under 13. On Monday, Instagram said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pausing-work-on-instagram-kids-app-124639135.html">“pause”</a> that work in order to create more “parental supervision tools.” Members of Congress responded saying they want the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/democratic-lawmakers-cancel-instagram-kids-184621575.html">to end</a> the project entirely. Facebook’s head of safety is scheduled to testify at a Senate Commerce Committee <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/9/protecting-kids-online-facebook-instagram-and-mental-health-harms">hearing</a> on the subject Thursday.</p><p>Now, Facebook seems to be hoping that releasing more of its underlying research could help address concerns from lawmakers and others. In a separate statement <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/">published</a> Sunday, the company’s top researcher suggested that <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> had mischaracterized its research. Clegg went a step further Monday, saying that the reporting based on documents “leaked by someone who clearly feels they have some points to make.”</p><p>“If you read the decks, and then compare it with some of the assertions that, you know, Instagram is toxic for all teens and so on, I don&#39;t think any reasonable person … would say that the research sustains that claim,” Clegg said. “When the dust settles people will see that we&#39;re just sincerely trying to kind of — like external researchers — are trying to work out what the complex relationship is between individuals, given their own individual circumstances, and their lives and their use of social media.”</p><p>A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the company would release “two decks” that were central to <em>The Journal</em> report, but didn’t elaborate on the timing of the release.</p><p>But the decks alone are unlikely to quiet Facebook’s critics. For one, Facebook’s own rebuttal of <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> reporting appears <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4">to undermine</a> the significance of its own research. “This research, some of which relied on input from only 40 teens, was designed to inform internal conversations about teens’ most negative perceptions of Instagram,” Facebook VP Pratiti Raychoudhury wrote. “It did not measure causal relationships between Instagram and real-world issues.”</p><p>It also raises questions about how Facebook will present the data it does make public. Last month, the company released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html">a report</a> on “widely viewed content” on its platform. The report was meant to rebuff criticism that News Feed favors polarizing content. But researchers outside the company quickly poked holes in the report, and said it was emblematic of Facebook’s larger transparency issues, particularly when it comes to working with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-data-transparency-researchers-170021370.html">outside researchers</a>.</p><p>Which is why it’s notable that Clegg would invoke “external researchers” in his defense of the company. If Instagram isn’t actually harmful to most teens, as the company is claiming, then researchers not on Facebook’s payroll may be positioned to credibly make that point. Yet researchers say the company has made data increasingly difficult to access. And in some cases, the company has actively blocked outsiders from studying its platform, like when it recently disabled the personal Facebook accounts of researchers at New York University and then provided <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-letter-facebook-nyu-ad-observatory-014113346.html">“misleading”</a> explanations about its reasons for doing so, according to the FTC. (Incidentally, the researcher at the center of that controversy is testifying in a separate Congressional<a href="https://republicans-science.house.gov/legislation/hearings/investigations-oversight-subcommittee-hearing-disinformation-black-box"> hearing</a> this week.)</p><p>They may seem like unrelated issues. But if Facebook had better relationships with researchers outside the company, and made more of its own findings public it might be better able to head off internal critics who “have some points to make.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-teen-safety-research-212546087.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7fac7da-2314-48c0-a67a-2db264a54e1c</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 21:25:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632784654</ingested><modified>2021-09-27T23:17:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-07/5f6af1a0-a99b-11e9-bcad-c7fa8d54ceaf" width="4090" height="2727" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/5f6af1a0-a99b-11e9-bcad-c7fa8d54ceaf" width="4090" height="2727" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Platiau / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A visitor takes a picture of the Instagram application logo at the Young Entrepreneurs fair in Paris, France, February 7, 2018.

According to <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/babylon-5-reboot-the-cw-j-michael-straczynski-1235075236/"><em>Variety</em></a>, The CW has ordered a reboot of the seminal sci-fi series. What’s more, original creator J. Michael Straczynski is attached to the project.</p><p>That’s good news because Straczynski penned 92 of the 110 episodes that make up <em>Babylon 5</em>. At the moment, there are relatively few details on the production, but what we do know is that it’s being billed as a “from-the-ground-up reboot.” None of the original actors from the series, including Bruce Boxleitner, are currently attached to the project, but that may change. With its sometimes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/babylon-5-original-4-3-ratio-video-150022687.html">dated visuals</a>, it can be hard to see what makes <em>Babylon 5 </em>so special.

For one thing, video calls (on what Skype calls the &quot;call stage&quot;) are getting a visual overhaul. New layouts and themes are on the way. You&#39;ll be able to see yourself on the main view while you&#39;re on a call, though you can hide your feed if you&#39;d rather not look at your own face.</p><p>Video feeds are being rearranged into a grid to avoid relegating folks to a minimized view.

You can also opt only to include people who are sharing video in the grid or switch the video stream off completely. Audio-only participants can use one of the app&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/skype-custom-background-images-193644673.html"><ins>background replacement images</ins></a> while on a call, rather than grey nothingness.</p><p>More colorful themes are in the pipeline, with features including gradients for buttons and for users without avatars. Meanwhile, &quot;the beauty of the left side panel screams art, balance and lightness,&quot; says Skype, giving perhaps its best Apple impression.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1e5a8570-1fc5-11ec-beff-297b5e4c87b1" style="height:3087;width:3550;" alt="Redesigned Skype Meet Now invite, with a name and avatar for the call" data-uuid="96cbe954-01b8-332d-a6ac-911f3e15a217"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skype</div></figure><p>Skype is also redesigning <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-03-skype-meet-now-zoom.html"><ins>Meet Now</ins></a>, which allows people to join calls without signing up or installing the app. Invitation links are getting a new look, as invitees will see the name and avatar of your call. The service says it will soon support all browsers as well.</p><p>In addition, Skype is working on performance. It claims it has boosted performance &quot;in key scenarios&quot; by almost a third on the desktop app and by over 2,000 percent on Android. Also new or on the way are custom notification sounds, and an updated reactions window that lets you respond more quickly by searching or using pinned reactions.</p><p>Elsewhere, you can use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-16-office-lens-on-windows-10-support-office365.html">Office Lens</a> on the Skype mobile app to share scanned documents, photos and videos. A new feature called TwinCam will let you add a video feed from a second device to your call. That could be handy if you want to show off your pet, or let students see your textbook and your face at the same time. Just scan a QR code with your iOS or Android device to get started.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8aecab60-1fc4-11ec-a4fd-06187d52d3e8" style="height:700;width:1453;" alt="Skype TwinCam feature" data-uuid="4f701542-20af-3a43-97e5-517269214cb7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Skype</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/skype-colorful-redesign-features-twincam-191644761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4423367b-d07c-4126-b4bb-d1959829c5f8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 19:16:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632770207</ingested><modified>2021-09-27T19:16:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ab343820-1fc4-11ec-a6fd-b94b59815f3f" width="3190" height="1890" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ab343820-1fc4-11ec-a6fd-b94b59815f3f" width="3190" height="1890" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Skype]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Skype redesign on a MacBook Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Skype redesign on a MacBook Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Democratic lawmakers say Facebook 'must completely abandon' Instagram Kids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Mere hours after Facebook said it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pausing-work-on-instagram-kids-app-124639135.html"><ins>pausing work on Instagram Kids</ins></a>, a group of Democratic lawmakers has called on the company to instead completely abandon the project.

However, TikTok’s rise in popularity is especially impressive when you consider almost exactly a year ago the Trump Administration was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-us-ban-trump-023941270.html">threatening to ban</a> the app if ByteDance, TikTok’s Bejing-based parent company, didn’t sell it to an American buyer.</p><p>Then you have the speed at which TikTok achieved the feat. The app has only been widely available since 2018 — though you could download it in select markets as early as 2017. It took Instagram nearly eight years after its initial release and almost six years after it was acquired by Facebook in 2012 before it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-20-instagram-1-billion-users.html">passed the 1 billion user threshold</a>. Granted, the internet was a smaller place then with fewer people connected to it through their phones, but none of that takes away from TikTok’s ascent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-tiktok-1-billion-monthly-active-users-154034999.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6f95c020-9a99-4d43-9043-e58d8798c327</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 15:40:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632757238</ingested><modified>2021-09-27T15:40:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-02/2f6fe710-4ddf-11ea-b3ff-ca9d067be64b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-02/2f6fe710-4ddf-11ea-b3ff-ca9d067be64b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anatoliy Sizov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tyumen, Russia - January 21, 2020: TikTok and Facebook application  on screen Apple iPhone XR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TikTok and Facebook application  on screen Apple iPhone XR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook will open up the Oculus Go to tinkerers with an unlocked OS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/facebook"><ins>Facebook</ins></a> will soon let folks who still have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/oculus%20go"><ins>Oculus Go</ins></a> do so much more with the virtual reality headset.

And the family that watches absurdist British comedy together… has a lot of in-jokes. For example, Any time we’re, say, outside when it starts raining and we all scurry for shelter, someone in my family is bound to scream in a silly voice, “Run away! Run away!” That person was me while playing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-preview-e3-130020326.html"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a>, not just because it’s a fun thing to say — it’s the only way to survive that game for the first hour or so.</p><div id="f89e1cc2927d463d8fa049cdf6df2564"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOvefm5U250?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Metroid Dread" href="https://amzn.to/3CKVfRy"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a> is the fifth of the 2D adventures (not counting remakes) and the first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-metroid-dread-release-date-163036346.html">new 2D installment in 19 years</a>, since <em>Metroid Fusion</em> in 2002. And yet, I probably haven’t played a Metroid game since the ‘80s or ‘90s, so I was happy to see that the basic formula hasn’t changed. It’s still an exploration game where you’re trapped in a series of underground facilities and must find your way out by destroying enemies, blowing up walls, and squeezing through tight passages.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That last one has been upgraded, at least. While you’ll still eventually gain Samus’ famous morph ball technique, at the start of the game you can instead do a crouch-slide through tunnels by hitting L1. It’s kind of fun, except that there’s a bit of a learning curve in figuring out which passages are for sliding and which are for rolling. As you unlock new abilities, you can, of course, revisit old locations to attain items you couldn’t reach the first time around.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/79bee190-1f20-11ec-bf59-469c02775474" alt="Samus sliding under a wall" data-uuid="e93ee912-f2c4-39d3-ab4f-81d19c83ef24"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>The story kicks off a little while after the end of <em>Metroid Fusion</em>, with Samus Aran once more being called upon to track down and destroy the parasitic creatures known as “X.” Familiarity with the previous game isn’t vital to understanding <em>Dread</em>, except that Samus can still absorb X nuclei to recharge her energy, and she remains susceptible to cold. Both of these traits come into play rather early in the game. Early on, Samus is attacked by what appears to be a super-strong Chozo, losing her old equipment and abilities in the process (as is tradition). This puts her and the player back to square one, which certainly draws out the story but may frustrate long-time players. I understand why the game does this, but I still get annoyed because it’s a huge cliché at this point. I can only hope the payoff to the mystery of who this huge, unstoppable enemy is ends up being worth it.</p><p>In fairness, it doesn’t seem any of those old tools would help with the new stealth elements of the game. You see, the facility is guarded by gangly giant robots called EMMI (“Extraplanetary Multiform Mobile Identifier”) that will stab you in the neck if they catch you. It’s a pretty visceral bit of animation, even if it cuts out before anything particularly gory. You can attempt a melee attack to knock them off, but in my dozen close encounters with the robots I never got that tactic to work once.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/efc6e780-1f1f-11ec-bfab-6f333fb0960e" alt="Samus clings to a wall while firing at a creature" data-uuid="09eadf40-4870-3634-846c-7b8daa770fa9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>Instead, the game debuts a few new tools as you play that will help, like a spider magnet that lets you cling to ceilings and other high surfaces. The most valuable ability we’ve seen in previews so far is a cloaking field that will hide you from an EMMI while draining your energy (and eventually, life) bar. But both of these, along with more powerful weaponry, have to be picked up later in the game.</p><p>When you’ve just arrived on the planet, however, the biggest survival tactic in your arsenal will be running. Lots and lots of running and jumping and getting the hell out of there. The game will sort of warn you when one of the robots is nearby, and you can attempt to stay just out of range. A blue field means it’s just sort of around, yellow means it’s aware of your presence, and on red you better run like hell. Your best bet is to stay unnoticed, a task made somewhat trickier by the fact that this stealth game lacks a lot of stealth game mechanics. Crouching behind boxes does nothing, and you can’t slide up against the wall to go unnoticed. Nor do the EMMI subscribe to the “out of sight, out of mind” philosophy: They will follow you into another room and, if you slip into an area where they cannot follow, they will try to find a way in.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/48db9f50-1f20-11ec-abff-9a2097fd6671" alt="Samus Aran firing the Omega Stream at an EMMI" data-uuid="6e15f104-c4c4-3d41-b4d8-6449bfc7d582"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nintendo</div></figure><p>The EMMI are quite fast, which makes the game itself quite ruthless. A few of my untimely deaths were due to being chased by one of the robots and not knowing where to go next. This game can be very unforgiving when you’ve just started exploring.</p><p>Still, despite being a Metroid newbie I found it engaging. Even as I got stabbed in the neck repeatedly I was always scanning the environment before the game blacked out, looking for the point where I screwed up and could do better. I only had 90 or so minutes with the game, so I didn’t have the luxury of slamming my head up against the wall to figure it all out. But when <em>Metroid Dread</em> comes out on October 8th, I am looking forward to having all the time to scream my head off and… run, run, run.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-hands-on-130040843.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a05bf81b-cb74-481e-8b6f-6ae9c760f2aa</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 13:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632760486</ingested><modified>2021-09-27T16:35:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c4bd4bb0-1f1f-11ec-beee-57138e5ae421" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c4bd4bb0-1f1f-11ec-beee-57138e5ae421" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samus Aran with a giant arm CANNON]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Switch OLED is a strong contender for most gorgeous handheld ever]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo makes good hardware, but I don’t know if I’d ever personally describe any of it as “beautiful.” The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-gamecube-20th-anniversary-games-140054823.html">GameCube</a> was cute; I loved the clamshell design of the Game Boy Advance SP; and I still have fond memories of the SNES’s dogbone controller. But the Switch? I’m just sort of “okay” with it. It’s never been a piece of a hardware that screamed “touch me” — until now, with the upcoming <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Switch OLED model" href="https://amzn.to/3EWlfvt">OLED model</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4a4fe210-1caa-11ec-91bd-60886de8e2c1" alt="Metroid Dread, Samus Aran shooting at blobs" data-uuid="a305b297-9de3-39b6-b0d4-3728ff2a1ddb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Set to come out October 8th, the marquee feature of the new Switch is its larger, sharper screen. It’s been bumped up to a 7-inch OLED from the 6.2-inch LCD of the original. I got to spend about an hour and a half with it and, though I couldn’t compare the two systems side by side, I certainly noticed the difference when I got home. I fumbled for the brightness settings on my OG Switch only to sadly realize they were at max. The OLED is bright, crisp and gosh-darn beautiful. The original Switch display still looks good, but the new screen is <em>great</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/849ee7a0-1ca9-11ec-b57e-782d54751c55" alt="Left Joy-Con with screen and hand visible" data-uuid="d2864cbd-33b4-3e91-9e72-7240b09d45e0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>The game shown in my demo was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-hands-on-130040843.html">the upcoming Metroid Dread</a>, which comes out the same day as basically a “launch title” for the refreshed system. It’s a good choice given the dark, sometimes claustrophobic settings of the Metroid series. It’s easy enough to see every passage and to distinguish the impassable bricks from the ones you’re supposed to blow up. The game will still be playable on a regular Switch or Switch Lite, but it feels like the game was meant to be seen on the new hardware.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f3090c70-1ca9-11ec-b79d-fad727152c7d" alt="Narrow power and volume buttons" data-uuid="6fbecc92-7670-371d-9a74-460fff967bb2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>And it’s more than just that larger display. It’s still the same basic shape and size but somehow feels more svelte, despite being heavier than the original. The volume and power buttons along the top are narrower, a design choice I’m not crazy about even though I didn’t find them particularly hard to press. (I think I just prefer the feel of a circular button over an oval-shaped one.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cedf6380-1ca9-11ec-8c97-18cdc21912f8" alt="Back of Nintendo Switch with wider kickstand" data-uuid="9e1cae50-0093-32d4-9137-6d78326a813e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>The new kickstand is also pretty great, stretching all the way across the back of the system instead of the original’s flimsy vertical strip that fell off if you looked at it funny. Sure, the new one takes a little more effort to pull it out but it’s worth it for the extra sturdiness and reliability. And, be still my heart, it’s actually adjustable, though I didn’t make use of this much since I preferred to play the system in handheld mode. It just felt… good.

That’s not the case,&quot; Mosseri wrote. &quot;The reality is that kids are already online, and we believe that developing age-appropriate experiences designed specifically for them is far better for parents than where we are today.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>An important part of what we’ve been developing for &#39;Instagram Kids&#39; is a way for parents to supervise their child’s use of Instagram. While we’re pausing our development of &#39;Instagram Kids,&#39; we’ll continue our work to allow parents to oversee their children’s accounts by expanding these tools to teen accounts (aged 13 and over) on Instagram.</p></blockquote><p>Some of the issues raised about the project revolve around Facebook&#39;s problems with privacy and particularly child safety. &quot;Not only is social media an influential tool that can be detrimental to children who are not of appropriate age, but this plan could place children directly in the paths of predators,&quot; New York state attorney general Letitia James said when the project first came to light.&nbsp;</p><p>Most recently, <em>The</em><em>Wall Street Journal</em> published an <a href="https://archive.is/egPlc#selection-1695.0-1695.196">article</a> claiming that Facebook has knowingly ignored its own research showing that Instagram is toxic to the mental health of younger people. Yesterday, the social network <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/research-teen-well-being-and-instagram/">refuted</a> that article as well, saying its research said that young people had &quot;both positive and negative experiences with social media,&quot; among other things.</p><p>Facebook pointed out that both YouTube and TikTok have versions of their apps for kids under 13. It also said that Instagram Kids would not be the same as Instagram is now, and is meant for tweens between 10 and 12 years old, not younger children.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;It will require parental permission to join, it won’t have ads, and it will have age-appropriate content and features,&quot; according to Mosseri. He also pointed out that Facebook has implemented several new measures on issues like body image, encouraging people to look at other topics or take a break if they&#39;re dwelling on negative content.&nbsp;</p><p>However, lawmakers don&#39;t like even the idea of the app, regardless of intent. &quot;The alternative approach that Facebook appears poised to take — specifically, pushing kids to sign up for a new platform that may itself pose threats to young users’ privacy and wellbeing — involves serious challenges and may do more harm than good,&quot; wrote a group of Democratic lawmakers.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-pausing-work-on-instagram-kids-app-124639135.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8b22e888-9d43-499c-83cb-2d8fcb20af47</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 2021 12:46:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632747371</ingested><modified>2021-09-27T12:56:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/59fc03d0-1f91-11ec-bff3-26b21bb54202" width="2000" height="1328" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/59fc03d0-1f91-11ec-bff3-26b21bb54202" width="2000" height="1328" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Getty Images/iStockphoto]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook is ‘pausing’ work on Instagram Kids app amid growing scrutiny]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook is ‘pausing’ work on Instagram Kids app amid growing scrutiny]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Beyond Meat's plant-based 'chicken' tenders are coming to grocery stores]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/beyond%20meat"><ins>Beyond Meat</ins></a> brought its plant-based “chicken” tenders to restaurants this summer, and soon you&#39;ll be able to enjoy them at home when Beyond starts selling them through retailers.

Beyond expects to expand availability later this year.</p><p>The company says its tenders have 50 percent less saturated fat than ones made with actual chicken, and have no GMOs, antibiotics, hormones or cholesterol. Beyond uses faba beans rather than a soy-based recipe in its attempt to replicate the taste and texture of a chicken tender.

It&#39;ll bring Breakfast Sausage Patties to more than 1,300 additional stores, while more locations will offer Beyond Meatballs and Beyond Beef Crumbles.</p><p>It&#39;s been a busy month in the plant-based meat alternative ecosystem.
