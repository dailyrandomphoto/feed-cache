It is beautiful, does 4K, HDR, variable refresh rates and more. Everything looks amazing on it.</p><p>As I bought it, I thought about how I’ve never been at the vanguard of TV tech, and how it would only last a couple of weeks until LG ruins it all with even newer TV models.</p><p>And like clockwork, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-ex-enhance-brightness-30-percent-095813152.html"><ins>here it comes</ins></a>. LG Display’s next generation of OLED tech, called &quot;OLED EX,&quot; that&#39;s supposed to &quot;enhance brightness up to 30 percent compared to conventional OLED displays,&quot; The company also upgraded the TV’s designs too, reducing the thickness by 30 percent and bezel size from 6 to 4mm on 65-inch OLED displays.</p><p>In defense of my new 55-inch OLED, this is LG Display, not LG, the part of the multinational company that brings this new TV tech to stores, so that doesn’t mean it’s landing in a new TV immediately. It’s just, sigh, already on the horizon.</p><p>-Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-down-183417137.html https://www.engadget.com/...">‘Fortnite’ went briefly offline yesterday</a></h2><h3>It’s back now.</h3><h3></h3><p>If you had tried to play <em>Fortnite</em> yesterday, you may have had issues.

According to Chinese officials, the station had to perform evasive maneuvers on July 1st and October 21st this year to minimize the chance of a collision. In its complaint, the country asked the UN Secretary-General to remind countries (read: the US) that parties in the Outer Space Treaty are responsible for incidents beyond Earth, even if they involve private companies.</p><p>The accusations line up with astronomer Jonathan McDowell&#39;s conjunction observations for both days. China further argued that SpaceX&#39;s satellites weren&#39;t always predictable. During the October incident, the Starlink craft was &quot;continuously&quot; maneuvering in a way that made it difficult to predict the orbital path.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-spacex-starlink-un-complaint-221835093.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-review-150019762.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Rivian’s R1T electric truck brings adventure to the EV crowd</a></h2><h3>Not just an impressive EV, but an impressive truck.</h3><h3></h3><p>Announcing a vehicle is one thing, actually following through and building that vehicle at a factory and then selling it, that’s an almost impossible feat for a new company.

One of the steps it has taken to comply with Apple&#39;s guidelines is to limit the results for certain tags or search terms that Tumblr says &quot;may fall under the expanded definition of sensitive content.&quot; The website will even completely block some of them — make that more than some, based on this pretty <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YG7E84Dvs2PyoKMgSgZFgEX0Kh0RtJqsazZsyVGY8dk/mobilebasic">lengthy list</a> of banned and limited terms collected by Tumblr users that <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/29/tumblr-ios-tags-ban-apple/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> posted.&nbsp;</p><p>While the inclusion of specific words in the list is self explanatory, it also has some curious entries, such as &quot;Eugene Levy&quot; and &quot;Tony the Tiger.&quot; The restriction will also make it harder to search for content related to mental health, such as PTSD, depression and anxiety, as well as issues like racism and transphobia. Those searching for a blocked tag will get a screen that says &quot;This content has been hidden&quot; instead of a page with results. They&#39;ll see the same notification if they try to access a blog that&#39;s been flagged as &quot;explicit&quot; on the app. Users may also see fewer suggestions under the &quot;stuff for you&quot; and &quot;following&quot; sections due to the new restrictions.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tumblr has implemented these changes three years after it started completely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-03-tumblr-blocking-adult-content-december-17th.html">blocking adult content</a> on its platform. If you&#39;ll recall, Tumblr prohibited adult content in 2018 after Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-20-tumblr-pulled-app-store-child-exploitation.html">pulled</a> its app from iTunes in response to finding child exploitation photos on the website. The social network said these changes only apply to its iOS app and that they won&#39;t affect anyone browsing Tumblr on the web or on Android. A spokesperson also told <em>TechCrunch</em> that the company is &quot;working on more thoughtful solutions which will be rolled out in the near future.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-ios-tags-restriction-115024668.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93fa43d5-aa41-4218-9381-480724b1d0dd</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 30 Dec 2021 11:50:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640864868</ingested><modified>2021-12-30T11:47:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2018-12/e560f4a0-f724-11e8-bbfd-8a61f9182b6e" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-12/e560f4a0-f724-11e8-bbfd-8a61f9182b6e" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas White / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Tumblr application is seen on a mobile phone in this illustration photo March 7, 2018.

It saw a 140 percent increase in people switching brands for the foldable compared to the Galaxy S21, as well. The Flip&#39;s form factor is of course its main draw, along with its front screen that gives users a way to use their phone without having to open it. As for the Fold 3, people who responded to Samsung&#39;s survey said they got it for its large screen, multitasking capabilities and S Pen support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its post, Samsung said foldables are expected to grow tenfold by 2023, and it&#39;s heavily investing in research and development to be able to keep up with rival devices that will surely pop up.

Given the beauty brand&#39;s experience with creating nude nail polishes, the seven colors &quot;encompassed a variety of skin tones with a mix of warm, neutral and cool undertones. While the colors reflect actual skin tones, most users will find the colors &quot;flattering&quot; without an exact match, according to JLab.

Oink Games’ is no Jackbox, but it's a worthy party game collection]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every year I try to have a little “holiday gaming café” gathering at my apartment, where I invite friends over to play board and card games. While last year’s party was understandably cancelled, this year I invited a small group over and we indulged in tabletop titles like <em>We’re Doomed</em> and <a href="https://keymastergames.com/products/parks"><em><ins>Parks</ins></em></a>. Inevitably we reached the point in the evening where people’s attention started to stray so it seemed like a good idea to switch to party video games. But instead of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jackbox-games-practice-friends-203026096.html">old standby Jackbox</a>, I remembered that <a href="https://oinkgames.com/en">Oink Games </a>had just released a board game collection and decided to give that a spin.</p><p>We discovered that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/lets-play-oink-games-switch/"><em>Let’s Play! Oink Games</em></a> was not like <em>Jackbox Party Packs</em> at all, as it did not work with phones and required separate copies of the game on separate consoles. Pass. So we turned off the Switch, hooked up my laptop and started up <a href="https://amzn.to/3ppDbbX"><em>Jackbox Party Pack 8</em></a> instead.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you live in a friendless cave and aren’t familiar with Jackbox, it’s a pretty great series: Each “Party Pack” has five party games that anyone can join in with their phone (or any web browser) by going to Jackbox.tv and inputting the special room code. The narrator explains how to play and walks the group through each round — which makes it pretty great for those guests who aren’t paying attention or are super, super drunk. Most of the games involve drawing, trivia or writing silly words. (My particular favorite is ‘Mad Verse City’ from <em>Jackbox Party Pack 5</em>, a rap game.)</p><div id="0d9cdd47dad8453aa5f58475b6f5825b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzY1YlPAHWw?rel=0&amp;start=4" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>After everyone left, I decided to give <em>Let’s Play! Oink Games</em> another try. And, while it isn’t an alternative to Jackbox (it’s more like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clubhouse-Games-Worldwide-Classics-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B086Z9D3TD?crid=2XRGNV120KACL&amp;keywords=clubhouse%2Bgames&amp;qid=1640550977&amp;sprefix=clubhouse%2Bgames%2Caps%2C84&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=cctbuyersguide21-20&amp;linkId=b03eeb789ae6988409cb504fc495e7c6&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><em>Clubhouse Games</em></a>, if anything), it is still a somewhat fun experience, though not worth the $22 I spent.</p><p>There are only four games included with the set: <em>Startups</em>, <em>Deep Sea Adventure</em>, <em>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</em>, and<em>‘Moon Adventure</em>. They’re all computerized versions of Oink’s tabletop games, which come in little card-deck-sized boxes and usually cost $20 each. In that respect, the video game version does seem like a good deal. You have a choice to play online with either people you know or strangers, offline with people you know, or offline with CPU opponents.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60dbdc30-68ba-11ec-b4be-f2103e0f49f2" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Let&#39;s Play! Oink Games: A Fake Artist Goes to New York" data-uuid="f6a44e25-d847-337a-9fe7-92d83cd0608e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oink Games</div></figure><p>Offline with friends wasn’t happening since, as I pointed out earlier, you all need your own copy of the game and a console. I tried to find an online match, only to discover there weren’t any going on. So my only choice was offline with CPU opponents.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</em> can’t be played with CPU opponents, as it’s a drawing game where all the players but one are given a prompt, and you have to figure out who the “fake” artist is. I also discovered that <em>Moon Adventure</em> can have multiple players, but the user is tasked with playing them all since it’s a cooperative game. So it’s really a battle with resource management as you attempt to gather supplies before your oxygen runs out. I found this one the toughest of all, even after looking at the helpful instructions and videos the game builds in. For all my qualms with the title, the instructions are really well-done.</p><section data-eng-breakout="2742e1a9b51d417f80b25d1fd37d7e80" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60dbdc30-68ba-11ec-ae3f-ea886448a402" alt="Let&#39;s Play! Oink Games: Startup game" data-uuid="47d7e165-937a-3dd7-8a72-dfa21d2d62fe"></section><p>However, the instructions didn’t get me any closer to winning Startups, one of the two games where CPU players can participate. And man, are they merciless. The idea is to gather as many “shares” in a company as possible, but if you don’t have the most you end up having to pay out to the person who does. It’s like a modern version of Monopoly where you land on Boardwalk all the time. At least this one plays a lot quicker.</p><p>The last game, <em>Deep Sea Adventure</em>, is my favorite. It’s sort of competitive and sort of cooperative, as all the players must share the same oxygen supply and diving too deep will deplete it quickly. Once I got into the rhythm of gathering treasure and running back to the sub as soon as possible I mastered the game and was regularly kicking CPU butt.</p><p>While it was perhaps unfair of me to expect <em>Let’s Play: Oink Games</em> to be a <em>Jackbox</em> replacement, there’s still a lot of room for growth in what they have. I’d like to see a mode where users who don’t own the game can play on their own systems with a person who does, similar to how Mario Kart used to work on the DS. And I do hope they add more games, if only because this is an easier way to learn how to play instead of trying to puzzle out badly translated print instructions from Japanese, which is what you deal with in the physical versions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lets-play-oink-games-jackbox-irl-160044668.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1f34e139-156c-4e52-9aff-6ea33e024c73</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640791766</ingested><modified>2021-12-29T15:29:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/aab0c500-68ba-11ec-8dba-075611dce43a" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/aab0c500-68ba-11ec-8dba-075611dce43a" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oink Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Let's Play!

Now comes the fun part. No PS5 is complete without a library of games and accessories to elevate your experience. Thankfully, you won&#39;t have as much trouble getting your hands on those. However, if you&#39;re new to the console, the tricky part is knowing what titles and peripherals are worth your time. We’ve gathered our favorites here to make the search easier for you.</p><h2>PlayStation Plus</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/080ee9f0-5e81-11ec-beff-5864ae199406" alt="PlayStation Plus" data-uuid="2c20f8ac-5ce1-3664-ad23-931732b7bc3b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>If the PS5 is your first console or you&#39;re coming from an Xbox, one of the first things you&#39;ll want to pick up is a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:PlayStation Plus subscription" href="https://amzn.to/3lEt3Kb">PlayStation Plus subscription</a>. It’ll help you flesh out your library. Sony gives a handful of free games away to PS Plus subscribers each month, and as long as you maintain an active membership, they&#39;re yours to keep. The selection is sometimes hit and miss, but you&#39;ll find a few gems every year. You&#39;ll also need PS Plus to play most games online, though a subscription isn&#39;t required for free-to-play titles like <em>Call of Duty: Warzone. </em>The addition of PlayStation Store discounts and cloud storage make PS Plus a no-brainer if you see yourself using your PS5 constantly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3lEt3Kb" id="ee6f2dc54abb40babc1d7d1a2ca61cf5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PS Plus (1 year) at Amazon - $60</a><h2>SteelSeries Arctis 7P+</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/155b7470-5e81-11ec-bd3e-599ed855e559" alt="SteelSeries Arctis 7P+" data-uuid="040dfd1f-1ed6-3383-84f6-ddd5ae2662b7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">SteelSeries</div></figure><p>Do the people you live with a favor and buy yourself a decent headset.

In an email to customers obtained by <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/28/rivian-delays-bigger-battery-pack-electric-pickup-2023/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, CEO RJ Scaringe said the company is prioritizing the production of R1T vehicles equipped with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-r1s-epa-range-estimates-231228358.html">314-mile</a> “Large pack” battery. Once those orders are fulfilled, it will then turn its attention to the more affordable “Explorer Package” trim and “Max pack” battery.</p><p>“In setting our delivery timing, we optimized our build sequence around the build combination that would support us ramping as quickly as possible and therefore have the largest possible positive climate impact,” RJ Scaringe writes in the email. We’ve reached out to Rivian for more information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the same message, Scaringe notes Max battery variants account for approximately 20 percent of the 71,000 R1T and R1S preorders the automaker has secured as of December 15th of this year. That suggests the delay involves about 14,200 vehicles. Rivian is allowing people to change their orders if they want to get their R1T earlier. It also promised to share more information on delivery timings in early 2022.</p><p>Rivian has delayed deliveries of the R1T several times over the last few years. The truck was originally scheduled to debut in 2020, but the company eventually pushed that date back to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">September 2021</a>. The pandemic and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/global-chip-shortage-gamers-gpu-console-delays-160008383.html">chip shortages</a> have played a part in that, but Rivian also doesn’t have a lot of manufacturing capacity at the moment.

For 140 years, scientists have been unwilling to unwrap the king’s body out of fear they’ll damage his ornate face mask and bandages. But thanks to computer tomography (CT) technology, they don’t have to take that risk anymore. Researchers at Cairo University recently <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.778498/full">digitally “unwrapped”</a> Amenhotep to learn about his life and dynasty.</p><p>The scans revealed he was about 35 years old when he died. &quot;Amenhotep I seems to have physically resembled his father: he had a narrow chin, a small narrow nose, curly hair, and mildly protruding upper teeth,&quot; Dr. Sahar Saleem, the lead author of the study, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59808883">told <em>PA Media</em></a>. It’s not clear why he passed away at such a young age. Researchers found no evidence of external wounds or disfigurements that may have contributed to his death.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a0094c70-6802-11ec-a93e-f5ffc7fde7df" alt="Amenhotep I" data-uuid="353bf3c0-ab53-329f-ba8f-23b55bd85745"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sahar Saleem et al. </div></figure><p>What they did discover were various post-mortem injuries that were likely inflicted on the body by grave robbers. That damage was “lovingly repaired” by mortuary priests of the 21st Dynasty some 400 years after Amenhotep’s death. They used a resin-treated linen band to reattach the head and neck together. Researchers also found some 30 amulets hidden among Amenhotep’s bandages. The fact they were still there even after his reburial likely disproves the long-held theory that priests of later dynasties would reuse the ornaments in the funeral rites of their pharaohs.</p><p>The study provides an insight into one of the most fascinating periods of Egyptian history. Amenhotep I ruled between 1525 and 1504 BCE, during Egypt’s New Kingdom period. He was among the first pharaohs of the 18th dynasty, a lineage that would later include Akhenaten, the controversial “heretic” pharaoh who introduced the kingdom to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atenism">monotheistic-like religion</a> centered around the sun. He was also the father of Tutankhamun or King Tut.&nbsp;</p><p>The first time archaeologists used a CT scan to examine a mummy was in 1977. As the technology has matured and become more accessible, it has allowed researchers to study mummies in ways they couldn’t before. In 2017, for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-20-mummies-museum.html">Chicago’s Field Museum</a> was able to dive into its collection, one of the most extensive in the US, with the help of portable CT scanners.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amenhotep-ct-scan-204504392.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7f8e82e-2237-43f3-8ef4-e225eb937b83</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 23:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640722710</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T20:18:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[History]]></category><category><![CDATA[Anthropology & Archaeology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5be0df90-6802-11ec-8bb9-a583cc9530e3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5be0df90-6802-11ec-8bb9-a583cc9530e3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sahar Saleem et al. ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amenhotep I]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amenhotep I]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[China says its space station dodged Starlink satellites twice this year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers aren&#39;t the only ones <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-sunshades-162340057.html">taking issue with SpaceX&#39;s Starlink satellites</a>.

While they didn&#39;t provide detailed explanations, the move was clearly in response to the rise of COVID-19&#39;s Omicron variant and the corresponding surge in new cases. AMD is switching its in-person transactions to virtual ones in the &quot;best interest&quot; of everyone&#39;s health, the company said in a statement.</p><p>AMD was already poised to launch its 2022 products through a livestream on January 4th.

It also downplayed the wave of departures, noting there had been more new sign-ups than exits as of December 23rd.

After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-ideas-sonic-set-191757999.html">nearly a year</a> of work, the company has <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2021/december/lego-sonic-the-hedgehog-green-hill-zone-set">revealed</a> that its <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> Green Hill Zone set will be available <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:LEGO.com;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:online" href="https://fave.co/3ev7zLE">online</a> and in Lego stores on January 1st, 2022 for $70 (£60). The brick-based recreation of the game&#39;s best-known area includes minifigs for Sonic, Dr. Eggman (aka Dr. Robotnik), two critters and the Phantom Ruby. Sonic won&#39;t dart around loops, unfortunately, but there is a Technic lever to launch him (or any other characters) along with the rings and powerups you&#39;d expect.</p><p>The set is the finished adaptation of Sonic fan Viv Grannell&#39;s submission to the Lego Ideas platform. Their concept set racked up the 10,000 votes necessary to be considered for a real set. Lego officially began work in February.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You probably won&#39;t see too many more video game-themed Lego sets in the near future. Sonic and Mario are two of the best-known franchises — other game-related Lego Ideas for <em>Legend of Zelda</em>, <em>Metroid</em> and other classics haven&#39;t come close to passing the 10,000-vote threshold. This does illustrate the power of crowdsourcing, though, and it&#39;s good news for kids who grew up with a Genesis (or Mega Drive) in the living room.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lego-sonic-the-hedgehog-release-date-price-193034341.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7a757ba4-2d40-4fad-b8f6-837af4bea373</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 19:30:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640727839</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T21:44:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0d71f3b0-67eb-11ec-9fbf-0429912291ee" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/0d71f3b0-67eb-11ec-9fbf-0429912291ee" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lego]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lego 'Sonic the Hedgehog' Green Hill Zone set]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lego 'Sonic the Hedgehog' Green Hill Zone set]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Remedy is making a co-op shooter with Tencent]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/remedy%20entertainment/">Remedy Entertainment</a> has added yet another project to its busy dance card. The studio is working with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tencent/">Tencent</a> on a free-to-play co-op shooter codenamed <em>Vanguard </em>(no relation to the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/call%20of%20duty%20vanguard/"><em>Call of Duty game</em></a>).</p><p>The player vs. environment (PVE) title will bring &quot;Remedy’s narrative expertise and action gameplay into an immersive multiplayer experience,&quot; <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-signs-a-global-development-license-and-distribution-agreement-with-tencent-for-the-co-operative-multiplayer-game-codenamed-vanguard/">the developer said</a>. It&#39;s making the game for PC and consoles, but it&#39;ll probably be some time before Remedy offers a look at <em>Vanguard</em>, since it&#39;s still in the proof-of-concept stage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Remedy will publish the game in most countries, though Tencent will localize and publish it in some Asian markets. The companies are co-financing <em>Vanguard</em>, which will be a live service game that&#39;s frequently updated. Remedy and Tencent will each pay their own publishing and operation costs, and they&#39;ll give each other a slice of revenue after they earn back what they shelled out on development.</p><p>In addition, Tencent will make and release a mobile version of <em>Vanguard, </em>which is Remedy’s original intellectual property. The Chinese conglomerate will cover the development and publishing costs, and it will share revenue with Remedy.</p><p>“<em>Vanguard</em> marks Remedy’s first entry into Games-as-a-Service business model, executed by our top tier team of free-to-play experts. We are building something new and exciting for co-operative multiplayer space, on top of Remedy’s strengths,&quot; Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said in a statement. &quot;<em>Vanguard</em> is a global opportunity, and Tencent can support Remedy internationally, and lead the operations in Asia and the mobile markets.&quot;</p><p>Remedy has several other games on its slate. Back in June, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/control-spin-off-multiplayer-co-op-remedy-505-191228046.html">announced</a> a co-op PVE game based on the terrific <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/control/"><em>Control</em></a><em>, </em>as well as what sounds like a bigger-budget sequel. Earlier this month, the studio confirmed it&#39;s making <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-2-announced-2023-release-014338992.html"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a><em>, </em>a sequel to the 2010 cult classic that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-remaster-4k-ps5-trailer-071047656.html">Remedy re-released this year</a>. The developer is also working on the single-player component of first-person shooter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crossfirex-remedy-entertainment-172425868.html"><em>CrossfireX</em></a>.</p><p>As for Tencent, the long-term partnership builds on a lengthy string of gaming deals the company has made in 2021. It has <a href="https://twitter.com/ZhugeEX/status/1471883075210645507">bought</a> or taken a stake in more than 100 gaming-related businesses this year.
