One of the companies, <a href="https://sentiar.com/"><ins>SentiAR</ins></a>, offers software that allows doctors to see a 3D model of a patient’s heart while they’re operating them. Another company, Brainlab, wants to make its Mixed Reality Viewer software available on Magic Leap 2.</p><p>That Magic Leap is making its latest wearable available to digital healthcare startups first isn’t surprising; CEO Peggy Johnson said as much would happen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/magic-leap-2-release-date-peggy-johnson-interview-160326037.html"><ins>last April</ins></a>. &quot;Augmented reality may transform healthcare more than any other industry, at least in the near term,&quot; she said at the time, noting also that the company would focus on enterprise customers at launch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Magic Leap has famously struggled since its emergence as one of Silicon Valley’s most hyped startups.

Netflix was still the frontrunner with one or more <a href="https://www.sagawards.org/awards/nominees-and-recipients/28th-annual-screen-actors-guild-awards">nominations</a> in nearly every category, including multiple picks for <em>The Power of the Dog</em> (three) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-142-million-households-squid-game-070044407.html"><em>Squid Game</em></a> (four) as well as individual nods for productions like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dont-look-up-review-dicaprio-climate-change-180058853.html"><em>Don&#39;t Look Up</em></a>, <em>Passing</em> and <em>Halston</em>. However, Apple also fared particularly well this year — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ted-lasso-season-two-july-23-apple-tv-plus-225341867.html"><em>Ted Lasso</em></a> received five nominations, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-show-season-2-teaser-apple-tv-plus-141241307.html"><em>The Morning Show</em></a> racked up four. <em>Coda</em> and the not-quite-released <em>The Tragedy of Macbeth</em> also burnished Apple&#39;s image.</p><p>Other services also had their due. Amazon had success with titles like <em>Being the Ricardos</em> and <em>The Tender Bar</em>, while Disney&#39;s empire made its presence felt with nominations for <em>The Handmaid&#39;s Tale</em> and Disney+ series like <em>Loki</em> and <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix also broke a cultural boundary — <em>Squid Game</em><a href="https://twitter.com/squidgame/status/1481300075989303297">is the first</a> non-English series to receive a SAG nomination, not to mention the first Korean series. This isn&#39;t completely surprising given Netflix&#39;s eagerness to produce worldwide blockbusters, but it&#39;s notable given how difficult it has been for foreign releases to crack these awards.</p><p>Theater- and TV-first material still has a significant presence in SAG&#39;s nominations. Nonetheless, it&#39;s evident the partial return to normalcy in entertainment only had a limited effect — streamed shows are still thriving in the current awards landscape.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sag-awards-2022-nomintions-netflix-apple-amazon-191041019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">281ca81b-3d48-4f0a-918b-e9b2595db6df</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 19:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642014642</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T19:10:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment Events]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d2b5b460-73d3-11ec-adff-45e98907388b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d2b5b460-73d3-11ec-adff-45e98907388b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Noh Juhan/Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Squad from Netflix series 'Squid Game']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Squad from Netflix series 'Squid Game']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat adds bitmoji reactions and threaded replies to chats]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/snapchat"><ins>Snapchat</ins></a> is ringing in the new year with a bunch of new features.

On Wednesday, the White House said it would allocate billions toward projects that lead to the construction of more wind, solar and geothermal energy across the country.</p><p>Specifically, the administration announced it’s moving forward with the lease of six commercial areas off the coasts of New York and New Jersey for use in wind farm projects. On offer is more than 488,000 acres of ocean seafloor for the winning bidders to build an estimated 5.6 and 7 gigawatts of clean power generation. As part of the bidding process, the White House says it will incentivize participants to support labor jobs and to source turbine components from American manufacturers. The New York Bight development is one of the primary pillars of the Biden administration’s plan to build out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-off-shore-wind-plan-204820118.html">30 gigawatts of offshore wind production by 2030</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another significant facet of today’s announcement is the “Building a Better Grid” initiative. Pulling from the $65 billion Congress set aside for power grid upgrades when it passed President Biden’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/11/06/fact-sheet-the-bipartisan-infrastructure-deal/">Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act</a>, the initiative earmarks $2.5 billion toward funding the installation of new transmission lines. It’s putting another $3 billion toward an expansion of the Smart Grid Investment Grant Program, which supports projects that increase the capacity and flexibility of existing electrical infrastructure.</p><p>The administration notes it will also allocate $10 billion in grants to states, tribes and utility companies to help those groups strengthen their local transmission lines. Taken together, the investments will help modernize the country’s power grid, making it easier to transport renewable energy from remote generation sites to where it’s needed most. It will also harden the power grid against the kind of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-cold-snap-outage-193054181.html">extreme weather events</a> that have become more commonplace as the effects of climate change have worsened.</p><p>Today’s announcement sees the White House putting forward meaningful climate policy, but if the Biden administration is to have a chance of meeting the president’s ambitious goal of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-12-10/how-joe-biden-s-2035-green-energy-grid-could-work">decarbonizing the country’s power grid by 2035</a>, it will need to bypass the legislative gridlock that has left the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/build-back-better/">Build Better Back Framework</a> in limbo. Much of that will depend on whether the White House can convince Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia to support the approximately $1.75 trillion climate and social spending bill.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-administration-climate-change-policy-181033816.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4ee13fdb-3f9b-49e6-9407-165c9e47ee26</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 18:10:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642013684</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T18:55:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/04874080-73cf-11ec-a9de-a4bbffca008a" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/04874080-73cf-11ec-a9de-a4bbffca008a" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ZHOUSHAN, CHINA - NOVEMBER 24, 2021 - An aerial photo taken on November 24, 2021 shows wind turbines rotating under sea breeze at a wind farm in Zhoushan City, Zhejiang Province, China.

Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple and Acer held on to their respective top-five positions in shipments, but Apple and Acer were the shining stars after growing deliveries over 20 percent compared to 2020. Frontrunners Lenovo and HP had the slowest growth of the leaders in 2021, and saw their shipments fall in the very last quarter where other rivals grew.

That, in turn, has led to some ImageRunner multifunction printers incorrectly <a href="https://twitter.com/ErickStarren/status/1480258812275671042">flagging</a> official cartridges as knockoffs — Canon has even told printer owners how to bypass the warnings and deal with broken toner level detection.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Canon for comment. Some users said they&#39;ve encountered similar issues with HP printers, but  that company wouldn&#39;t directly confirm or deny the problems in a statement to <em>The Register</em>. Instead, HP said it was using a &quot;globally diverse&quot; supply network to stay &quot;agile and adaptable&quot; in the midst of chip shortages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The printer trouble illustrates one of the common complaints about digital rights management (DRM) and other copy protection systems: they create trouble the moment their designers can&#39;t offer full support. Just ask people who bought music <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-04-23-microsoft-turns-the-drm-screw-on-msn-music-owners.html">tied to Microsoft&#39;s PlaysForSure</a>, for example. It&#39;s doubtful Canon, HP or others will drop their DRM chips any time soon, but this incident won&#39;t exactly help their case.</p><p><strong>Update 1/12 1:05PM ET:</strong> Canon told Engadget its focus was to &quot;limit possible disruption&quot; to customers, and that included shipping toner cartridges without the anti-knockoff chips. The company stressed there was no shortage of the cartridges themselves — American customers still had a &quot;continuous supply.&quot; You can read the full statement below.</p><blockquote><p><em>While the global shortage of semiconductor components continues to affect many industries, it’s our priority to limit possible disruption to our customers. As with all manufacturers, we continually monitor our supply chain to anticipate and prepare for any potential disruption and we are taking steps to deal with the situation, such as adjusting product designs. One example of this is in toner cartridges for some of our MFP devices (imageRUNNER/imageRUNNER ADVANCE) as we are currently facing a shortage of the chip that is fitted inside the toner cartridge to monitor its remaining toner levels. There is no shortage of toner cartridge itself – a shortage of the chip that lies inside the toner cartridge. As such, we’re now shipping toner cartridges for some of our MFP devices without this chip to ensure we’re still providing a continuous supply of consumables to our Canon U.S.A. customers. We have also issued guidance on how to install and manage these new toner cartridges.</em></p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canon-printer-ink-cartridge-false-fake-claims-161752274.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c78161c1-e036-4048-baad-e5e087115abc</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 16:17:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642010805</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T18:06:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8c0ac4b0-73ba-11ec-9fc3-f0643c874048" width="6754" height="4508" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8c0ac4b0-73ba-11ec-9fc3-f0643c874048" width="6754" height="4508" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AndreyPopov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Irritated young businesswoman looking at printer machine at office]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Irritated Businesswoman Looking At Printer Machine At Office]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2' is delayed until December 8th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. fans will need to wait several more months than expected to get their hands on the latest game in the series.

It was the company’s first foray into fully customizable keyboards, and we liked it a lot. Today it’s the turn of the Q2, which is a smaller (65% or no “function key”) version of the Q1. Despite the reduced footprint, it retails for the same price, starting at $149 for the barebone or $169 if you want it fully assembled – cheaper than much of the competition.</p><p>When we tested the Q1 we liked it a lot. It offered the same level of configuration as the much-loved GMMK Pro for about $100 less. That said, the selling point of the GMMK Pro (in this author’s opinion) is all about those luxurious “Lubed Panda” switches and the firm, responsive typing experience. The “Panda” is GMMK’s own “switch” which for those that don’t hang out at <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-mito-gmk-hennessey-custom-keycap-set"><ins>Drop</ins></a> and/or use a “mech” are the mechanical part of the key – the important bit, really, as that’s mostly what will define how the keyboard “feels.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As with the Q1, the Q2 is compatible with <a href="https://caniusevia.com/"><ins>VIA</ins></a> configuration software (and thus QMK) which easily allows you to remap keys to almost anything, create macros and more. Also like the Q1 (and the <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black"><ins>GMMK Pro</ins></a> and increasingly others) there’s the option to replace the top-right-most key (Insert) with a clickable rotary for volume and media control.</p><p>I’ll admit, after using the GMMK Pro for a while now, I find the Gateron Reds that came with the Q2 a little flacid by comparison, but that’s the joy of a customizable keyboard, you can use whatever switches you like (or change out more or less any other part). You could even load it with the Pandas if you wish, though that would require a (lot of) extra spend.</p><p>The Q2 remains USB only (no wireless) but is still compatible with either Windows or Mac and the corresponding OS-specific keycaps are included in the box. It’s also just as rugged and well built as the Q1 with the all-metal casing. You can choose between three colors thereof: Black, gray and navy blue.</p><p>Ultimately, the selling point of the Q2 boils down to whether you prefer a compact keyboard or to have access to physical function keys (they’re still accessible here with shortcuts obviously).</p><p>The Q2 is also joined by some other relatively new additions. Keychron is prolific if nothing else. In particular, there’s the lightweight/70% <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k14-wireless-mechanical-keyboard"><ins>K14 </ins></a>which is both wireless and has hot-swappable switches for a more affordable on-the-go option that retails for a modest $59. The company also recently unveiled its first mouse wired <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-m1-mouse"><ins>the M1</ins></a>. It’s visually quite similar to the Razer Viper ($39) but also bears more than a passing resemblance to the <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-model-o-black"><ins>Glorious O</ins></a> (also from the same people behind the GMMK Pro).</p><p>Orders for the Keychron Q2 are open as of today.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/keychron-q-2-keyboard-140003464.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cdfdfd04-ee7e-4544-87b2-611172ba453f</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641903611</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T12:31:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b84d1530-72d6-11ec-b6ea-a0371615ed38" width="2000" height="1260" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b84d1530-72d6-11ec-b6ea-a0371615ed38" width="2000" height="1260" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Keychron Q2 fully customizable keybord.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Keychron Q2 ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Connected dumbbells that  Amazon's Alexa can adjust]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WFH didn’t just mean working from home.

It also features Logitech&#39;s TrueSoft technology, which promises cinematic color accuracy and enables a soft, flattering light that can apparently make streamers look less, well, tired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether it can truly provide a &quot;radiant&quot; look across all skin tones remains to be seen. Different skin tones require different approaches to lighting on video — using the same lighting for white actors, for instance, had made Black actors look ashy or barely visible during dimly lit scenes in movies and shows <a href="https://fashionmagazine.com/flare/insecure-lighting/">for a long time</a>. One of the creators Logitech got to talk about Litra Glow, however, is Black visual artist and photographer Aundre Larrow, who once shared tips on how to photograph darker skin tones in an article he <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/discover/article/10-tips-for-photographing-darker-skin-tones">wrote for Adobe</a>. Larrow said of Litra Glow:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The lighting looked natural. It looks good on my skin and works for people of different skin tones without looking blown out. The warm to cool is super accurate and I found light to be strong and soft enough to use on its own.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Ring lights and streamer lights have become a lot more popular thanks to the rise of game streaming services like Twitch, but also to provide lighting for creators on YouTube and TikTok. Elgato already offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-ring-light-130016714.html">a Ring Light and Key Light</a> for streamers, but they are a lot more expensive than Logitech&#39;s new device.&nbsp;</p><p>Logitech designed Litra Glow to be plug-and-play, and streamers can choose between five presets with different brightness and color temperature. If they want to customize it further, they can adjust those settings on their own. They can also connect it to Logitech&#39;s G HUB software to create their own presets and assign them to the G Keys on a Logitech G keyboard or mouse. The Litra Glow will come with a monitor mount that has adjustable height, tilt and rotation when it starts shipping sometime this month.

Now, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has said that federal agencies spent $684 billion on coal plant carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects that have mostly failed, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-energy-department-blew-1-1-billion-on-carbon-captu-1848338427"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> has reported. It also spent $438 million on other three CCS industrial projects, two of which were cancelled.</p><p>&quot;DOE [Department of Energy] provided nearly $684 million to eight coal projects, resulting in one operational facility,&quot; according to the GAO report. &quot;DOE’s process for selecting coal projects and negotiating funding agreements increased the risks that DOE would fund projects unlikely to succeed.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>DOE’s process for selecting coal projects and negotiating funding agreements increased the risks that DOE would fund projects unlikely to succeed.</p></blockquote><p>Not only did the Department of Energy use a &quot;high-risk selection&quot; method to choose projects, it negotiated and funded them too expeditiously, according to the report. Coal negotiations lasted just three months instead of the usual year &quot;based on DOE&#39;s desire to begin spending American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds quickly.&quot; On top of that, it bypassed the usual cost controls and supported projects &quot;even though they were not meeting required key milestones.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The DOE recently said that it wants to dramatically reduce the cost of carbon capture technology via a program called <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot">Carbon Negative Shot</a>. The aim is to remove CO2 directly from the air and sequester it underground at a cost of less than $100 per ton, deploying it at the gigaton scale.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the easiest and cheapest way to cut gigatons of emissions would be to retire costly coal plants completely, according to a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/23/most-new-wind-solar-projects-cheaper-than-coal-report">report last year</a> the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena). That&#39;s because the costs of renewable energy have plunged in the last decade, making them effectively cheaper than coal. And of course, adding CCS tech to coal would increase costs considerably. All that said, coal and fossil fuels are a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jun/07/republicans-fossil-fuels-coal">charged political subject</a> in the US, despite the global risks of climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>In the end, the GAO recommended more congressional oversight for DOE expenditures on CCS. &quot;Absent such a mechanism, DOE is at risk of expending significant funds on CCS demonstration projects that have little likelihood of success.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-us-government-spent-11-billion-on-failed-carbon-capture-projects-111225335.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c80f7a5f-9dd9-44c1-9dd5-497fc74445ab</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 11:12:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641985946</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T11:12:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0b7c8b90-738c-11ec-bb3b-d24561649329" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0b7c8b90-738c-11ec-bb3b-d24561649329" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Trish Badger / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Petra Nova CCS Facility at NRG Power Plant in Richmond, Texas, U.S., May 18, 2018.

According to <a href="https://finbold.com/lawsuit-filed-against-kim-kardashian-for-promoting-bogus-cryptocurrency-to-her-followers/"><em>Finbold</em></a>, the platintiffs sued the celebrities and the still-unidentified entities behind the tokens for causing the value of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-29-49-million-ethereum-theft.html">Ethereum</a> knockoff to soar so &quot;they could sell their portion of the Float for a profit.&quot; The lawsuit lists anybody who invested in the token between May 14th and June 27th, 2021 as a defendant.</p><p>As <a href="https://gizmodo.com/kim-kardashian-sued-for-promoting-alleged-cryptocurrenc-1848339180"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> explains, the claimants are accusing the defendants of perpetrating a &quot;pump and dump&quot; scheme, in which investors sell off their shares to make a lot of money after orchestrating a rise in its value. The lawsuit states that the coin rose 632 percent in value after Mayweather and Pierce promoted it — the boxing star wore shorts with the EthereumMax URL during his exhibition match with Logan Paul, while Pierce tweeted about it.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, Kardashian posted about EthereumMax on Instagram Stories, telling followers that she heard about it from her friends and linking to its website.

The lawsuit states that the day after Kardashian&#39;s post, the token&#39;s value plummeted by 98 percent. Further, the coin&#39;s creators allegedly sold off their shares before the price drop, as shown by their wallet&#39;s activities.&nbsp;</p><p>Celebrities have been promoting cryptocurrency tokens for a while now and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-01-boxer-manny-pacquiao-cryptocurrency.html">creating their own</a>.

That’s thanks to <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"><em>Wordle</em></a>, a new puzzle game that’s become somewhat of an obsession for many since <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">wrote about</a> it just over a week ago.</p><p>Like other viral games, <em>Wordle</em> is deceptively simple: you have six chances to guess a new five-letter word. And that’s… pretty much it. There’s just one puzzle a day, and it’s free to play with no ads . Its creator, a software developer named Josh Wardle, is apparently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle">“overwhelmed”</a> by his game’s popularity. But the fact that the game doesn’t have an app has allowed developers to create their own knockoff version of the game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One particularly egregious example comes from developer Zach Shakked who created an app called <em>“Wordle - The App</em>.<em>” </em>At first glance, the app, which is subtitled “<em>Word Game Everyone&#39;s Playing!</em>” could easily be mistaken for the original. The word grid looks almost the same, and it even uses the same color scheme.

We&#39;re going to the fucking moon.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d88c9160-7333-11ec-bf34-6d0830191220" alt="The developer of a knockoff version of Wordle bragged about his success copying the viral game." data-uuid="8b77922a-935a-3e85-a181-0bb833b2db23"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot via Twittet</div></figure><p>Shakked and Wardle didn’t respond to questions from Engadget. But Shakked isn’t the only developer trying to cash in on the popularity of <em>Wordle.</em> His app is one of at least six <em>Wordle</em> clones launched in the App Store in the eight days since the original <em>New York Times</em> article about <em>Wordle.</em> Another, called “What Word - Wordle”  which charges a $0.99 in-app purchase to remove ads, claims to be the “No. 1 Word game” in its App Store screenshots. (It is actually ranked No. 7 in word games, according to its App Store listing.)</p><p>Scammy knockoff apps capitalizing on the popularity of a viral game is nothing new, of course. Game developers have been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-01-28-game-cloning-sucks.html">complaining about</a> the practice for years. Apple didn’t immediately respond to questions about <em>Wordle</em> clones in its store.  But, thanks to emails released during the Epic v. Apple trial, we do know that copycat apps have long been a source of frustration for Apple executives as well. “Is no one reviewing these apps? Is no one minding the store?&quot; Phil Schiller wrote in <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/06/phil-schiller-on-app-store-knockoffs-in-2012-is-no-one-reviewing-these-apps/">a 2012 email</a>. Three years later, he complained that “I can’t believe we still don’t” have automated tools to find scam apps.</p><p><strong>Update 1/11 7:52pm ET:</strong> App Store listings for the <em>Wordle</em> clones are no longer accessible, and the apps appear to have been removed from the store. We&#39;ve reached out to Apple for more information.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 1/11 10:05pm ET:</strong> Apple confirmed to Engadget that it had removed the games from its App Store.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/wordle-clones-app-store-232042208.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a7c6cb7-ef4f-4082-acba-1108e966bb73</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 23:20:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641994780</ingested><modified>2022-01-12T13:39:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1cea9420-73ab-11ec-89fc-c5cb382a82af" width="1470" height="1022" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1cea9420-73ab-11ec-89fc-c5cb382a82af" width="1470" height="1022" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wordle]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot from the word game 'Wordle'.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Wordle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Humble Bundle's simplified game subscription will include a members-only library]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Humble Bundle hasn&#39;t exactly won fans with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/humble-bundle-donation-cap-july-204446045.html">donation caps</a> and potentially confusing subscription tiers, but it&#39;s hoping to make some amends. As of February 1st, the company&#39;s monthly Humble Choice service is <a href="https://blog.humblebundle.com/2022/01/11/humble-choice-is-leveling-up/">consolidating</a> around a single $12 monthly plan that gives you permanent copies of every game offered in a given month. Humble noted the number of games might vary, but you can still skip a month if you don&#39;t like the selection and want to remain a member.</p><p>You&#39;ll also have access to more games so long as you&#39;re subscribed. A new Humble Games Collection gives you access to a curated, expanding catalog of titles you can access only as a Choice member. The initial mix is limited to just five games (including the relatively well-known <em>Void Bastards</em>) available through the Humble app, but the company clearly hopes the promise of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/january-ps-plus-games-persona-5-strikers-dirt-5-deep-rock-galactic-174854063.html">PlayStation Plus-</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-game-pass-pc-rebrand-035131086.html">Xbox Game Pass</a>-style library will keep you paying even when the monthly Choice selections aren&#39;t to your liking.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Choice has other <a href="https://support.humblebundle.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411127626139">modified</a> perks. You&#39;ll receive as much as a 20 percent discount on eligible games you buy in the Humble Store, but you&#39;ll have to stay subscribed for at least a year. You&#39;ll get that discount immediately if you&#39;re subscribed by February. Five percent of your membership fee will be donated to charities.</p><p>This won&#39;t thrill everyone. Classic subscribers who switch will lose their 20 percent discount the moment they skip a month, for instance. This could still be less confusing, though, and might be alluring if you want access to a host of indie games regardless of what the monthly catalog has to offer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/humble-choice-subscription-change-214917516.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">91cab0d1-0ae1-4fdf-a003-a9e62ea730f5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 21:49:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641937771</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T21:49:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/a66d0050-b013-11ea-bab3-067d70edc41c" width="1600" height="1063" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/a66d0050-b013-11ea-bab3-067d70edc41c" width="1600" height="1063" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jon Fingas/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Humble Fight for Racial Justice Bundle]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Humble Fight for Racial Justice Bundle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The FTC's antitrust suit against Facebook is cleared to move forward]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) can move forward with its latest antitrust lawsuit against Meta, a US district judge ruled on Tuesday.

Specifically, the FTC alleges Facebook used the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp in 2012 and 2014 to secure its dominant position in the social media market.</p><p>&quot;Today’s decision narrows the scope of the FTC’s case by rejecting claims about our platform policies. It also acknowledges that the agency faces a ‘tall task’ proving its case regarding two acquisitions it cleared years ago,&quot; a spokesperson for Meta told Engadget. &quot;We’re confident the evidence will reveal the fundamental weakness of the claims.
