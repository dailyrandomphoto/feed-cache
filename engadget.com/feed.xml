Oink Games’ is no Jackbox, but it's a worthy party game collection]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Every year I try to have a little “holiday gaming café” gathering at my apartment, where I invite friends over to play board and card games. While last year’s party was understandably cancelled, this year I invited a small group over and we indulged in tabletop titles like <em>We’re Doomed</em> and <a href="https://keymastergames.com/products/parks"><em><ins>Parks</ins></em></a>. Inevitably we reached the point in the evening where people’s attention started to stray so it seemed like a good idea to switch to party video games. But instead of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jackbox-games-practice-friends-203026096.html">old standby Jackbox</a>, I remembered that <a href="https://oinkgames.com/en">Oink Games </a>had just released a board game collection and decided to give that a spin.</p><p>We discovered that <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/lets-play-oink-games-switch/"><em>Let’s Play! Oink Games</em></a> was not like <em>Jackbox Party Packs</em> at all, as it did not work with phones and required separate copies of the game on separate consoles. Pass. So we turned off the Switch, hooked up my laptop and started up <a href="https://amzn.to/3ppDbbX"><em>Jackbox Party Pack 8</em></a> instead.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you live in a friendless cave and aren’t familiar with Jackbox, it’s a pretty great series: Each “Party Pack” has five party games that anyone can join in with their phone (or any web browser) by going to Jackbox.tv and inputting the special room code. The narrator explains how to play and walks the group through each round — which makes it pretty great for those guests who aren’t paying attention or are super, super drunk. Most of the games involve drawing, trivia or writing silly words. (My particular favorite is ‘Mad Verse City’ from <em>Jackbox Party Pack 5</em>, a rap game.)</p><div id="0d9cdd47dad8453aa5f58475b6f5825b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzY1YlPAHWw?rel=0&amp;start=4" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>After everyone left, I decided to give <em>Let’s Play! Oink Games</em> another try. And, while it isn’t an alternative to Jackbox (it’s more like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clubhouse-Games-Worldwide-Classics-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B086Z9D3TD?crid=2XRGNV120KACL&amp;keywords=clubhouse%2Bgames&amp;qid=1640550977&amp;sprefix=clubhouse%2Bgames%2Caps%2C84&amp;sr=8-1&amp;th=1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=cctbuyersguide21-20&amp;linkId=b03eeb789ae6988409cb504fc495e7c6&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"><em>Clubhouse Games</em></a>, if anything), it is still a somewhat fun experience, though not worth the $22 I spent.</p><p>There are only four games included with the set: <em>Startups</em>, <em>Deep Sea Adventure</em>, <em>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</em>, and<em>‘Moon Adventure</em>. They’re all computerized versions of Oink’s tabletop games, which come in little card-deck-sized boxes and usually cost $20 each. In that respect, the video game version does seem like a good deal. You have a choice to play online with either people you know or strangers, offline with people you know, or offline with CPU opponents.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60dbdc30-68ba-11ec-b4be-f2103e0f49f2" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Let&#39;s Play! Oink Games: A Fake Artist Goes to New York" data-uuid="f6a44e25-d847-337a-9fe7-92d83cd0608e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oink Games</div></figure><p>Offline with friends wasn’t happening since, as I pointed out earlier, you all need your own copy of the game and a console. I tried to find an online match, only to discover there weren’t any going on. So my only choice was offline with CPU opponents.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>A Fake Artist Goes to New York</em> can’t be played with CPU opponents, as it’s a drawing game where all the players but one are given a prompt, and you have to figure out who the “fake” artist is. I also discovered that <em>Moon Adventure</em> can have multiple players, but the user is tasked with playing them all since it’s a cooperative game. So it’s really a battle with resource management as you attempt to gather supplies before your oxygen runs out. I found this one the toughest of all, even after looking at the helpful instructions and videos the game builds in. For all my qualms with the title, the instructions are really well-done.</p><section data-eng-breakout="2742e1a9b51d417f80b25d1fd37d7e80" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60dbdc30-68ba-11ec-ae3f-ea886448a402" alt="Let&#39;s Play! Oink Games: Startup game" data-uuid="47d7e165-937a-3dd7-8a72-dfa21d2d62fe"></section><p>However, the instructions didn’t get me any closer to winning Startups, one of the two games where CPU players can participate. And man, are they merciless. The idea is to gather as many “shares” in a company as possible, but if you don’t have the most you end up having to pay out to the person who does. It’s like a modern version of Monopoly where you land on Boardwalk all the time. At least this one plays a lot quicker.</p><p>The last game, <em>Deep Sea Adventure</em>, is my favorite. It’s sort of competitive and sort of cooperative, as all the players must share the same oxygen supply and diving too deep will deplete it quickly. Once I got into the rhythm of gathering treasure and running back to the sub as soon as possible I mastered the game and was regularly kicking CPU butt.</p><p>While it was perhaps unfair of me to expect <em>Let’s Play: Oink Games</em> to be a <em>Jackbox</em> replacement, there’s still a lot of room for growth in what they have. I’d like to see a mode where users who don’t own the game can play on their own systems with a person who does, similar to how Mario Kart used to work on the DS. And I do hope they add more games, if only because this is an easier way to learn how to play instead of trying to puzzle out badly translated print instructions from Japanese, which is what you deal with in the physical versions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lets-play-oink-games-jackbox-irl-160044668.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1f34e139-156c-4e52-9aff-6ea33e024c73</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640791766</ingested><modified>2021-12-29T15:29:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/aab0c500-68ba-11ec-8dba-075611dce43a" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/aab0c500-68ba-11ec-8dba-075611dce43a" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oink Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Let's Play!

Provided the earbuds do arrive stateside, though, they could easily represent a bargain. We liked the Elite 3 for a combination of a low price with strong sound quality, healthy battery life and comfort —the 4 Active builds on that formula.

Now comes the fun part. No PS5 is complete without a library of games and accessories to elevate your experience. Thankfully, you won&#39;t have as much trouble getting your hands on those. However, if you&#39;re new to the console, the tricky part is knowing what titles and peripherals are worth your time. We’ve gathered our favorites here to make the search easier for you.</p><h2>PlayStation Plus</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/080ee9f0-5e81-11ec-beff-5864ae199406" alt="PlayStation Plus" data-uuid="2c20f8ac-5ce1-3664-ad23-931732b7bc3b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>If the PS5 is your first console or you&#39;re coming from an Xbox, one of the first things you&#39;ll want to pick up is a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:PlayStation Plus subscription" href="https://amzn.to/3lEt3Kb">PlayStation Plus subscription</a>. It’ll help you flesh out your library. Sony gives a handful of free games away to PS Plus subscribers each month, and as long as you maintain an active membership, they&#39;re yours to keep. The selection is sometimes hit and miss, but you&#39;ll find a few gems every year. You&#39;ll also need PS Plus to play most games online, though a subscription isn&#39;t required for free-to-play titles like <em>Call of Duty: Warzone. </em>The addition of PlayStation Store discounts and cloud storage make PS Plus a no-brainer if you see yourself using your PS5 constantly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3lEt3Kb" id="ee6f2dc54abb40babc1d7d1a2ca61cf5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PS Plus (1 year) at Amazon - $60</a><h2>SteelSeries Arctis 7P+</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/155b7470-5e81-11ec-bd3e-599ed855e559" alt="SteelSeries Arctis 7P+" data-uuid="040dfd1f-1ed6-3383-84f6-ddd5ae2662b7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">SteelSeries</div></figure><p>Do the people you live with a favor and buy yourself a decent headset.

But first, Hyundai might be giving up on new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-gas-engine-development-shutdown-174556919.html https://www.engadget.com/...">combustion engines.</a></p><p>The company only just made and released its first electric car, but it&#39;s apparently ready to move fast, and leave the engines of old behind. Korea Economic Daily sources claim Hyundai shut down its research center&#39;s combustion engine design unit sometime this month. While there will still be some workers left to refine existing engines, the rest will move to EV-related work.</p><p>Electrification is &quot;inevitable,&quot; new research chief Chung-kook Park reportedly said in an email, and the transition will help produce cars that &quot;dominate the future market.&quot; Park is probably right. In Hyundai&#39;s native South Korea, combustion-only car sales will be banned by 2030.</p><p>-Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2>&#39;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xvi-delayed-six-months-due-to-covid-19-142140517.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Final Fantasy XVI&#39;delayed a half year due to COVID-19</a></h2><h3>The reveal is now scheduled for spring of 2022.</h3><h3></h3><p>Final Fantasy fans were promised more information about the next installment of the role-playing series before the end of 2021.

That could help fix OLED&#39;s biggest flaw next to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-neo-qled-mini-led-160021037.html">mini LED</a> technology, namely a lack of overall brightness.&nbsp;</p><p>As LG Display points out, each OLED pixel emits light independently, meaning it can be fully on or off. That allows TVs to show perfect blacks with no &quot;blooming&quot; seen on LED TVs, but at the same time, OLED pixels can&#39;t hit the same brightness levels as LEDS. Current OLED sets can display peak brightness levels up to around 500-600 nits, while mini LED sets can hit 2,000 nits and higher.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7055bce0-688c-11ec-b6ef-98d09ce8bbf2" alt="LG Display Unveils Next-Generation OLED TV Display &#39;OLED EX&#39;" data-uuid="178eb822-4f3a-348d-911c-775c425d3589"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG Display</div></figure><p>To make OLED sets brighter, OLED EX (Evolution/eXperience) uses deuterium compounds to allow the light-emitting diodes to emit stronger light. &quot;When stabilized, the deuterium compounds allow the display to emit brighter light while maintaining high efficiency for a long time,&quot; LG Display said.&nbsp;</p><p>OLED EX also allows for improved color accuracy. It apparently uses algorithms to predict the usage of 33 million OLED diodes in an 8K display, so it &quot;precisely controls the display&#39;s energy input to more accurately express the details and colors of the video content being played.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The company also upgraded its designs, reducing thickness by 30 percent and bezel size from 6 to 4 mm on 65-inch OLED displays. The company didn&#39;t say yet when it plans to bring the technology to market, but it noted that OLED sales increased 70 percent last year despite a 12 percent decline in the global TV market. &quot;With our new OLED EX technology, we aim to provide even more innovative, high-end customer experiences through the evolution of our OLED technology, algorithms and designs,&quot; said LG Display&#39;s Dr. Oh Chang-ho.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-ex-enhance-brightness-30-percent-095813152.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a24479a7-30bd-4850-b3f7-f92109dad984</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 29 Dec 2021 09:58:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640776810</ingested><modified>2021-12-29T11:20:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b559aff0-687c-11ec-89ff-2e6187f11de4" width="2000" height="1368" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b559aff0-687c-11ec-89ff-2e6187f11de4" width="2000" height="1368" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG's next-gen 'OLED EX' supposedly enhances brightness up to 30 percent]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG's next-gen 'OLED EX' supposedly enhances brightness up to 30 percent]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Waymo will add custom-built EVs by Chinese company Geely to its robotaxi fleet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the future, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-self-driving-cars-new-york-city-130044539.html">Waymo&#39;s</a> robotaxi fleet in the US will feature electric vehicles build specifically for the service by Chinese automaker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/renault-geely-hybrid-joint-venture-china-south-korea-142131019.html">Geely</a>.

In an email to customers obtained by <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/28/rivian-delays-bigger-battery-pack-electric-pickup-2023/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, CEO RJ Scaringe said the company is prioritizing the production of R1T vehicles equipped with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-r1s-epa-range-estimates-231228358.html">314-mile</a> “Large pack” battery.

We’ve reached out to Rivian for more information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the same message, Scaringe notes Max battery variants account for approximately 20 percent of the 71,000 R1T and R1S preorders the automaker has secured as of December 15th of this year. That suggests the delay involves about 14,200 vehicles. Rivian is allowing people to change their orders if they want to get their R1T earlier. It also promised to share more information on delivery timings in early 2022.</p><p>Rivian has delayed deliveries of the R1T several times over the last few years. The truck was originally scheduled to debut in 2020, but the company eventually pushed that date back to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">September 2021</a>. The pandemic and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/global-chip-shortage-gamers-gpu-console-delays-160008383.html">chip shortages</a> have played a part in that, but Rivian also doesn’t have a lot of manufacturing capacity at the moment. It plans to break ground on a new factory in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-selects-georgia-second-ev-factory-230334796.html">Georgia next summer</a>.

For 140 years, scientists have been unwilling to unwrap the king’s body out of fear they’ll damage his ornate face mask and bandages. But thanks to computer tomography (CT) technology, they don’t have to take that risk anymore. Researchers at Cairo University recently <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmed.2021.778498/full">digitally “unwrapped”</a> Amenhotep to learn about his life and dynasty.</p><p>The scans revealed he was about 35 years old when he died. &quot;Amenhotep I seems to have physically resembled his father: he had a narrow chin, a small narrow nose, curly hair, and mildly protruding upper teeth,&quot; Dr. Sahar Saleem, the lead author of the study, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-59808883">told <em>PA Media</em></a>. It’s not clear why he passed away at such a young age. Researchers found no evidence of external wounds or disfigurements that may have contributed to his death.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a0094c70-6802-11ec-a93e-f5ffc7fde7df" alt="Amenhotep I" data-uuid="353bf3c0-ab53-329f-ba8f-23b55bd85745"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sahar Saleem et al. </div></figure><p>What they did discover were various post-mortem injuries that were likely inflicted on the body by grave robbers. That damage was “lovingly repaired” by mortuary priests of the 21st Dynasty some 400 years after Amenhotep’s death. They used a resin-treated linen band to reattach the head and neck together. Researchers also found some 30 amulets hidden among Amenhotep’s bandages. The fact they were still there even after his reburial likely disproves the long-held theory that priests of later dynasties would reuse the ornaments in the funeral rites of their pharaohs.</p><p>The study provides an insight into one of the most fascinating periods of Egyptian history. Amenhotep I ruled between 1525 and 1504 BCE, during Egypt’s New Kingdom period. He was among the first pharaohs of the 18th dynasty, a lineage that would later include Akhenaten, the controversial “heretic” pharaoh who introduced the kingdom to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atenism">monotheistic-like religion</a> centered around the sun. He was also the father of Tutankhamun or King Tut.&nbsp;</p><p>The first time archaeologists used a CT scan to examine a mummy was in 1977. As the technology has matured and become more accessible, it has allowed researchers to study mummies in ways they couldn’t before. In 2017, for instance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-20-mummies-museum.html">Chicago’s Field Museum</a> was able to dive into its collection, one of the most extensive in the US, with the help of portable CT scanners.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amenhotep-ct-scan-204504392.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c7f8e82e-2237-43f3-8ef4-e225eb937b83</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 23:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640722710</ingested><modified>2021-12-28T20:18:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[History]]></category><category><![CDATA[Anthropology & Archaeology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5be0df90-6802-11ec-8bb9-a583cc9530e3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5be0df90-6802-11ec-8bb9-a583cc9530e3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sahar Saleem et al. ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amenhotep I]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amenhotep I]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[China says its space station dodged Starlink satellites twice this year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Astronomers aren&#39;t the only ones <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-sunshades-162340057.html">taking issue with SpaceX&#39;s Starlink satellites</a>.

The brick-based recreation of the game&#39;s best-known area includes minifigs for Sonic, Dr. Eggman (aka Dr. Robotnik), two critters and the Phantom Ruby.

The studio is working with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tencent/">Tencent</a> on a free-to-play co-op shooter codenamed <em>Vanguard </em>(no relation to the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/call%20of%20duty%20vanguard/"><em>Call of Duty game</em></a>).</p><p>The player vs. environment (PVE) title will bring &quot;Remedy’s narrative expertise and action gameplay into an immersive multiplayer experience,&quot; <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-signs-a-global-development-license-and-distribution-agreement-with-tencent-for-the-co-operative-multiplayer-game-codenamed-vanguard/">the developer said</a>.

The companies are co-financing <em>Vanguard</em>, which will be a live service game that&#39;s frequently updated. Remedy and Tencent will each pay their own publishing and operation costs, and they&#39;ll give each other a slice of revenue after they earn back what they shelled out on development.</p><p>In addition, Tencent will make and release a mobile version of <em>Vanguard, </em>which is Remedy’s original intellectual property. The Chinese conglomerate will cover the development and publishing costs, and it will share revenue with Remedy.</p><p>“<em>Vanguard</em> marks Remedy’s first entry into Games-as-a-Service business model, executed by our top tier team of free-to-play experts. We are building something new and exciting for co-operative multiplayer space, on top of Remedy’s strengths,&quot; Remedy CEO Tero Virtala said in a statement. &quot;<em>Vanguard</em> is a global opportunity, and Tencent can support Remedy internationally, and lead the operations in Asia and the mobile markets.&quot;</p><p>Remedy has several other games on its slate. Back in June, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/control-spin-off-multiplayer-co-op-remedy-505-191228046.html">announced</a> a co-op PVE game based on the terrific <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/control/"><em>Control</em></a><em>, </em>as well as what sounds like a bigger-budget sequel. Earlier this month, the studio confirmed it&#39;s making <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-2-announced-2023-release-014338992.html"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a><em>, </em>a sequel to the 2010 cult classic that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alan-wake-remaster-4k-ps5-trailer-071047656.html">Remedy re-released this year</a>.

As <em>Electrek</em><a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/28/hyundai-shuts-down-engine-development-team-focus-electric-cars/">reports</a>, <em>Korea Economic Daily</em><a href="https://www.kedglobal.com/newsView/ked202112230013?lang=us">sources</a> claim Hyundai shut down its research center&#39;s engine design unit sometime this month. There will still be some workers left to refine existing engines, but the rest will move to EV-related work.</p><p>The company is understood to be converting buildings for EV development at the same time. The powertrain development center is becoming an electrification test facility, and the performance development center is now dedicated to electrified machines. There&#39;s also a new battery development center, while researchers are now sourcing raw battery and chip components.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The aim is simple, according to the leak. Hyundai wants to accelerate the transition to EVs, and that means devoting much more of its energy to the newer technology.

The change in priorities would make sense, at least.

The star of the show this year is ZamStar, a guitar and app combo designed to make collaboration and learning easier. Other notable projects include an AI solution to help kids develop good smartphone habits and a nursery mobile that can allow for early detection of infant strabismus (eye crossing).&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor/detail/zamstar">ZamStar</a> consists of an app and a custom guitar called ZamString. The idea is that you can play a part on the guitar, add effects and then sync it up with other musicians around the world. It&#39;s clearly a riff on the COVID-19 TikTok trend of musical collaborations (remember all those <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/13/style/sea-shanty-tiktok-wellerman.html">sea shanties</a> early this year), with the idea of making it easy to sync up your music. Meanwhile, the ZamString guitar has a fretboard that lights via input from a song, making it easy to figure out where to put your fingers. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKctumpc__U">not a new concept</a>, but perhaps the first to marry both the learning and collaboration aspects.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor/detail/piloto">Piloto</a>, meanwhile, is what Samsung calls an &quot;AI solution that helps children develop proper smartphone usage habits.&quot; The aim is to teach kids &quot;self-regulation skills&quot; on smart devices to help them make good choices. Finally, <a href="https://claboutside.com/ces2022/exhibitor/detail/innovision">Innovision</a> is &quot;a daily life eye-care system with a nursery mobile to catch suspicious symptoms of the strabismus and monitor visual ability development status for babies.&quot; That seems like a smart idea, since babies gaze natural towards mobiles.</p><p>Along with its inside incubators, Samsung&#39;s C-Lab Outside is backing nine startups, including an AI-based biometric recognition solution for pets called Petnow.

The Xiaomi 12 has a 4,500mAh battery, while the 12 Pro has what the company claims is the first single-cell 120W, 4,600mAh battery. Xiaomi says it offers an increased capacity of 400mAh over dual-cell batteries without having to increase the size.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The base model&#39;s camera array includes Sony&#39;s 50MP IMX766 as the main camera, a 13MP ultra-wide angle lens and a 5MP telemacro sensor.

But while the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro updates represent the most obvious case of Apple owning up to (and rectifying) past mistakes, the company has actually been on this course for the last few years. And at the end of 2021, Apple has just about finished replacing some of its most problematic designs.</p><p>Reviews of the new MacBook Pro are almost universally positive (aside from the high price points), but it’s still worth recapping just what a big change these laptops represent from their predecessors. Both of the new sizes are thicker and noticeably heavier than the models they replace; for a company that showed an almost fanatical obsession with thin-and-light design over the last decade, it’s a major about-face. But the older, 4-pound, 15-inch MacBook Pro often had trouble staying cool under heavy processor loads, a problem that couldn’t be solved without increasing the laptop’s size and weight. It’s as if Apple remembered it already has the MacBook Air, and that the people buying a Pro are willing to lug around a bit of extra weight for a more capable machine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1d7615a0-6270-11ec-b77f-f895064ad3a2" alt="Apple MacBook Pro (2021, 16-inch)" data-uuid="47584385-b794-3296-b18c-d233a119c785"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar / Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple arguably started moving in this direction with a mid-cycle refresh a few years ago. In 2019, the company started banishing the unreliable and uncomfortable butterfly keyboard for a significantly improved scissor-switch model. That revised keyboard arrived <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-macbook-pro-16-inch-review-ultimate-apple-laptop.html">on the first 16-inch MacBook Pro</a>. Along with the new keyboard, that laptop was a third of a pound heavier, and larger in every dimension than its predecessor.</p><p>That was the first indication that Apple was willing to fix some of the ill-fated decisions it made with the MacBook Pro lineup, which brings us to this fall’s refresh. Users still had a laundry list of things they wanted changing, and Apple largely delivered. The new models brought back the SD card slot and HDMI port that the company removed in 2016. The MagSafe charging port, one of Apple’s smartest innovations, also made a comeback. Finally, Apple replaced the Touch Bar with a standard row of function keys.</p><p>Of course, Apple only deserves so much credit for fixing self-inflicted wounds. But it feels like the company has a much clearer vision of what the people shelling out (at least) $2,000 for a MacBook Pro actually want. And beyond simply fixing earlier mistakes, the Apple-built M1 Pro and M1 Max processors offer massive performance gains and better battery life. Add in an outstanding new display and excellent keyboard and MacBook Pro buyers have a lot to look forward to. The fact that these computers are thicker and heavier than the ones they replace will barely be a consideration for most, especially since bigger laptops have space for things like extra ports, larger batteries and better cooling systems.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/939b8ea0-626f-11ec-bdfa-783052dcc8b0" alt="iPhone 13 Pro lineup" data-uuid="9fdac93c-4135-3c79-bf02-a41c5086f6fd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>While the MacBook Pro is the obvious example of Apple giving the people what they want this year, it’s not the only one. Take the iPhone 13 launch. The company once again released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">two standard models</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">two “Pro” models</a>, just as it did in 2020. In most ways, these phones were iterative updates over the 12 series — but all four phones have significantly better battery life than their predecessors. Improving longevity is an obvious way to make customers happy, but it’s still good news that Apple quickly identified the weak spot with the iPhone 12 lineup and fixed it. Perhaps not coincidentally, all iPhone 13 models are also all a little heavier than last year’s. (They&#39;re also imperceptibly thicker, at .30 inches vs. .29 for the iPhone 12.)</p><p>Again, though, there’s some recent precedence for Apple putting battery life over a thin-at-all-costs design. 2018’s iPhone XR was a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-22-iphone-xr-phil-schiller-interview.html">cheaper and slightly less elegant</a> version of the flagship iPhone XS — but its larger screen and thicker body left room for a battery that smoked the “superior” XS. So, in 2019, Apple made the iPhone 11 Pro bigger than the XS it replaced, but it also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-apple-iphone-11-pro-and-pro-max-review.html">vastly improved battery life</a>. It was particularly surprising to see Apple make a bigger iPhone after chasing thinness at all costs for so long, but it was definitely welcome. The company finally seems to realize that an impossibly thin device that constantly needs to be charged doesn’t make for a good user experience.</p><p>Another good example is Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-user-iphone-repair-policy-change-173047862.html">significant change of heart</a> around product repairs. Specifically, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">announced plans</a> to sell repair parts and instructions to customers who want to fix their iPhones themselves, a victory for anyone who felt they should be able to pop open their iPhone and put in a new battery or fix a broken display. While right-to-repair groups said there&#39;s still more Apple can do in this area, they nonetheless hailed it as a major step forward from the completely closed nature of its products, the vast majority of which haven&#39;t been user-serviceable before. Apple is starting with the iPhone, but said it will roll out some self-repair tools and parts for M1-based Macs in 2022, as well. The threat of government regulation may have played a big role in this new initiative, but the end result is still good for consumers.</p><p>Apple is even having a little more fun with its products than it has in a while. Take <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">the M1-powered iMac</a>, for example. I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-no-ports-why-191552791.html">wish that it had more ports</a> and, considering the price, it should have more RAM and storage — but the wide variety of colors Apple chose is just great. I’m dying for these colorways to come to a redesigned MacBook Air (fingers crossed for the spring). The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-new-colors-171521559.html">three new hues</a> in the HomePod mini lineup are another good example of Apple realizing that hardware you place in your home doesn’t just have to be gray or silver.</p><p>While the new MacBook Pro is a huge step forward for those who want serious power on the go, Apple still hasn’t given professionals the full desktop-class computers they need. Because Apple is in the middle of its transition to Apple Silicon, the larger iMac and Mac Pro machines are hard to recommend right now. Hopefully, Apple will bring the power of the M1 Pro and M1 Max to a larger iMac and a new Mac Pro tower in 2022. If they can wrap up this last bit of the transition next year, Mac buyers will be covered at all points of the company’s product lineup. It’s been way too long since we could say that.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-2021-year-in-review-143043756.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">202877ea-5041-4073-b81f-d9602b09a500</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Dec 2021 14:30:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640259485</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T11:38:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b711360-626e-11ec-abdd-5ad4eabe1c41" width="2000" height="1128" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b711360-626e-11ec-abdd-5ad4eabe1c41" width="2000" height="1128" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro (2021, 16-inch)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro (2021, 16-inch)]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
