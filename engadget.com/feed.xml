In the last year, I’ve seen fellow Engadget employees buy a Nintendo Switch just before the OLED model broke cover, take the plunge with the iPhone SE just before the iPhone 12 mini was unveiled and make several more shopping missteps. Now, I might have done the same.</p><p>I picked up Sony’s vlogging camera, the ZV-1, earlier this month. I was looking for an agile video setup for the occasional time I have to record footage at Engadget without a skilled member of our video team. It’s very easy to make it work, with great face tracking capabilities and even a product showcase mode that helps me really show off whatever gadget I’m handling and I was happy with it.&nbsp;</p><p>For a couple of weeks.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a768330-eeec-11eb-9fbf-1ce709229319" alt="Sony mirrorless ZV-E10" data-uuid="d59cdf73-35f2-3b40-b640-c90d4d3fd498"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Then I heard the rumors that Sony was about to expand its vlogging camera family, and my heart sank. Here it is, then. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-expands-its-vlogging-lineup-with-the-zv-e-10-mirrorless-camera-142731045.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">ZV E-10</a>, a new vlogging camera that fuses the tiny frame of the ZV-1 with interchangeable lenses.&nbsp;</p><p>The two major improvements seem to be a larger 24-megapixel sensor and an interchangeable mirrorless mount. The latter means you can use one of the 60-plus E-mount lenses, while that larger sensor should offer improved light sensitivity and a shallower depth of field. The ZV-E10 will launch by the end of August and will cost $700 for the body or $800 in a bundle with one of Sony&#39;s power zoom lens. The price is roughly level with how much I paid for the ZV-1 earlier this month. It’s probably too late to ask for a refund, right?&nbsp;</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-q2-2021-earnings-210238898.html%20https://www.engadget.com/..."><br>iPhone sales were up 50 percent year over year</a></h2><h3>Another record-breaking quarter for Apple.</h3><h3></h3><p>Despite the pandemic, Apple has spent most of the last two years relentlessly upgrading its product lineup, and its moves are definitely paying off.

Today, the audio giant was proved right, as new signups fell to nine million new users in the <a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-2021/default.aspx">most recent quarter</a>, but slower growth isn’t always a bad thing. Of that nine million figure, seven million users signed up for Premium, versus just two million who went ad-supported. It means that Spotify was also able to announce a second successive quarter of profitability after a long period of losses.</p><p>The total number of Spotify users now stands at 365 million, of which 165 million are paying for Premium, while the remaining 210 are ad-supported. Converting more of Spotify’s vast ad-supported user base into Premium users is one way to ensure the company remains profitable. Another, of course, is to boost its growing advertising business, which has been bolstered by Spotify’s numerous podcast offerings. The company said that it saw “triple digit” year-on-year gain in ad-sales for the company’s owned podcast outlets, including The Ringer, Parcast and Gimlet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The last three months has seen Spotify intensify work to push users toward cheaper forms of audio content than music.

No mention this month of how many people are tuning in to listen to former President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen hang out, which was the second biggest podcast on the platform from the start of the year.</p><p>As for the future, Spotify says that it’s hoping to add at least 12 million more users in total, and at least another five million more paying customers.

The machine serves as the basis for Agility Robotics&#39; delivery robot Digit, as <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/27/cassie-the-bipedal-robot-runs-a-5k/?tpcc=ECTW2020"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> notes, though you may also remember it for &quot;blindly&quot; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/a-bipedal-robot-has-learned-to-tackle-stairs-blind-102647481.html">navigating a set of stairs</a>. Oregon State University engineers were able to train Cassie in a simulator to enable it to go up and down a flight of stairs without the use of cameras or LIDAR. Now, engineers from the same team were able to train Cassie to run using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm.</p><div id="2c44962149d04a7b857d99ed165293f9"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dY57qnD_O7U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>According to the team, Cassie teaching itself using the technique gave it the capability to stay upright without a tether by shifting its balance while running. The robot had to learn to make infinite subtle adjustments to be able to accomplish the feat. Yesh Godse, an undergrad from the OSU Dynamic Robotics Laboratory, explained: &quot;Deep reinforcement learning is a powerful method in AI that opens up skills like running, skipping and walking up and down stairs.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The team first tested Cassie&#39;s capability by having it run on turn for five kilometers, which it finished with a time of 43 minutes and 49 seconds. Cassie finished its run across the OSU campus in 53:03. It took a bit longer because it included six and a half minutes of dealing with technical issues. The robot fell once due to a computer overheating and then again after it executed a turn too quickly. But Jeremy Dao, another team member from the lab, said they were able to &quot;reach the limits of the hardware and show what it can do.&quot; The work the team does will help expand the understanding of legged locomotion and could help make bipedal robots become more common in the future.</p><div id="1f74672132fe4a1081acd7d08dcbff43"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSaSjd_HOaI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/watch-cassie-bipedal-robot-run-5k-093045955.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7482a1ed-7ef7-40b5-ad78-ed266c1be7a9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 09:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627475790</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T12:36:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/62827220-ef6a-11eb-bd36-1a42b00c4d07" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/62827220-ef6a-11eb-bd36-1a42b00c4d07" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Agility Robotics]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cassie]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cassie]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG will reportedly sell iPhones in its South Korean stores]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rumors swirled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/apple-iphones-to-be-sold-lg-stores-korea/">last week</a> that LG would start selling iPhones in some of its South Korean stores, since it has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-mobile-worldwide-shutdown-020959355.html">stopped producing</a> its own smartphones,. Now, LG has confirmed that it will start selling iPhones and other Apple products next month, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amd-q2-strong-amid-epyc-ryzen-demand"><em>ZDNet</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>LG and Samsung agreed in 2018 to only sell their own smartphones at their respective stores so they wouldn&#39;t compete with smaller phone distributors. As such, when LG started to consider selling iPhones, it reportedly faced resistance from a smartphone reseller trade organization.

The company has 400 stores in South Korea, so the move could provide a significant boost to Apple. It could be to the detriment of Apple&#39;s arch-rival Samsung, though, which has essentially had the local smartphone market to itself since LG dropped out.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple supposedly started negotiating with LG to sell phones in its retail spaces after the Korean company announced it would end production of its own devices.

Its new 4.1 update is a smaller release but still adds a handful of handy features, including a new way to organize tabs.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chrome-tab-groups-feature-164057759.html">Like Chrome</a>, Vivaldi allows you to group multiple tabs to restore some semblance of order to your tab bar. In Vivaldi, those groups are called stacks. Before 4.1, you had two ways of using them. You could opt for either the compact view or the two-level one. In the latter case, the browser adds a bar that displays the tabs you have in that stack. The compact view, by contrast, only hints at the number of websites you have pinned to the same group.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f88249b0-ef12-11eb-8f54-fec49ac3fa84" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Accordion tab stack setting" data-uuid="467ada23-04d3-3675-bf99-b186637f5922"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivaldi</div></figure><p>The new &quot;Accordion&quot; stacks Vivaldi is introducing today give you a third option that is something of a compromise between its two siblings. The icon that represents the group will automatically expand when you click on it. Instead of on a second bar, you’ll see all the included tabs to the right of that icon. In that way, you can get context about your tabs without them taking up an entire extra element of the interface.</p><p>The other major feature the company is adding with 4.1 is called command chains. In Vivaldi, you can press “F2” (or “Command E” on Mac) to bring up a command-line interface, allowing you to quickly access most features without digging through the menu for the relevant option. Command chains allow you to group multiple actions and assign a name to them. Typing the name of the chain in the command interface will execute the included actions in a sequence. With more than 200 actions available, you have a lot of flexibility. For instance, you can create one that enables both fullscreen and reading modes at the same time. You can also assign the sequences you make to a custom keyboard shortcut or mouse gesture.</p><p>Outside of those features, 4.1 adds a timer in <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/tutorials/reader-view-in-vivaldi/">reader view</a> that estimates how long it should take you to work your way through an article. Lastly, the browser’s Windows client will now install new features in the background automatically. There’s an option to turn off “silent updates” in the settings menu. You can try Vivaldi 4.1 today.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vivaldi-accordion-tab-stacks-070000491.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">526f1b02-11ab-4b42-bf17-00c59f397f50</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627415708</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T19:55:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/83f4c0b0-ef11-11eb-a9ff-cc67090b4e07" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/83f4c0b0-ef11-11eb-a9ff-cc67090b4e07" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vivaldi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Vivaldi Accordion tab stacks]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Vivaldi Accordion tab stacks]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rivian reportedly plans to invest $5 billion in its second US assembly plant]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, news <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-second-factory-capacity-battery-cells-193825530.html">leaked out</a> that Rivian was planning to build a second US manufacturing plant for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-r1s-suv-delivery-dates-151911858.html">electric vehicles</a> and batteries, and now more details have leaked out. The company plans to invest $5 billion initially in the second plant, dubbed Project Tera, with construction slated to start in the fall of 2021, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-rivian-ready-invest-5-billion-second-us-assembly-plant-document-2021-07-27/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. The aim is to begin production by the second quarter of 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>The second plant will reportedly include a 50 gigawatt-hour (GWh) battery cell production operation and a product and technology center. There&#39;s no word on where it&#39;ll be built, but the company is reportedly looking at land east of Mesa, Arizona, near Gold Canyon, according to <em>Reuters</em>&#39; sources. Rivian Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe has reportedly spoken with Arizona Governor Doug Ducey about the project.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rivian previously acknowledged that it&#39;s looking to expand. “The company has recognized that future production and product plans will not be fully met by the current capacity at Rivian’s Normal, Illinois facility,” it said in the document seen by <em>Reuters</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The plant would supposedly support around 10,000 jobs, though many of those could come indirectly. For a startup that has so far not produced a single vehicle, however, the investment and job figures would be impressive. Rivian is backed by Ford, Amazon and other companies and could reportedly soar to a $50 billion value in a possible public listing later this year, according to Reuters&#39; previous story.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rivian-reportedly-plans-to-invest-5-billion-in-a-second-us-assembly-plant-052245738.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">313070a3-2a0e-4482-865e-ad259130fe7e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 05:22:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627449822</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T05:23:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/7ee95050-93b7-11eb-9e7f-a226a0880ebc" width="6415" height="4277" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/7ee95050-93b7-11eb-9e7f-a226a0880ebc" width="6415" height="4277" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rivian introduces R1T all-electric pickup truck at Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November 27, 2018.

The company just announced financial results for its fiscal year third quarter (for normal humans, the months of April through June), and the company made a shocking amount of money. All of its product segments (the iPhone, Mac, iPad, services, and wearables/home/accessories) increased in revenue year-over-year, leading to total revenue of $81.4 billion. As has often been the case, iPhone revenue of $39.6 billion made up almost half of that figure.&nbsp;</p><p>Quarterly revenue was up 36 percent year-over-year, and as such profit grew in a big way, too — in fact, it nearly doubled. Apple reported $21.7 billion in net income, up 93 percent compared to a year ago.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As already mentioned, all of Apple&#39;s product categories grew last quarter, but the biggest winner was the iPhone. Revenue grew 50 percent year-over-year, making it pretty clear the iPhone 12 lineup is a major success for the company. Apple&#39;s services division continues to explode; $17.5 billion in revenue represented 33 percent growth, and the category makes more than double the money of any other division in Apple, with the obvious exception of the iPhone.</p><p>The company&#39;s &quot;wearables, home and accessories&quot; group lumps the Apple Watch in with devices like the HomePod mini and the new AirTags. It grew 36 percent and made $8.8 billion in revenue. The Mac and iPad had more modest gains, with Mac revenue increasing 16 percent year over year to $8.2 billion and iPad revenue climbing 12 percent to $7.4 billion. While the Mac number isn&#39;t an eye-popper like services, it&#39;s worth nothing that just a few years ago, Mac revenue was pretty flat, sitting in the $4 billion range for a while — but it seems like the M1 Mac move has helped spur some big increases.</p><p>As usual, Apple CEO Tim Cook is holding a call with investors — we&#39;ll update this story with anything we learn.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-q2-2021-earnings-210238898.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc8b7e84-d0a3-450e-8dc2-1c99bbb12648</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 21:02:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627420001</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T21:06:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e6b6c310-e417-11eb-bb99-2be7f7ad1e4f" width="5719" height="3805" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e6b6c310-e417-11eb-bb99-2be7f7ad1e4f" width="5719" height="3805" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[People walk past an Apple retail store on July 13, 2021 in New York City. - Stock markets were slightly softer on news of the biggest jump in US inflation in more than two decades and disappointment in results from US investment banks.

But even more impressive, its profits jumped by 47 percent to reach $16.5 billion.

That&#39;s a jump of 62 percent from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-alphabet-q1-2020-earnings-210401873.html">same period last year</a>, when the organization&#39;s revenue dipped due to the onset of the pandemic. Last quarter, Alphabet posted $55.3 billion in revenue. Clearly, the company has long recovered from the slump it faced from the pandemic last year. Like chief financial officer Ruth Porat said on an earnings call, its results are &quot;lapping the impact of COVID on our business.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Like it did last quarter, Alphabet&#39;s net income rose significantly, from about $7 billion in Q2 2020 to $18.5 billion in the same period this year. Most of its money continues to come from advertising and search, while Google Cloud and its &quot;Other Bets&quot; division saw modest revenue growth as well.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement that &quot;a rising tide of online activity in many parts of the world&quot; and &quot;long-term investments in AI and Google Cloud&quot; drove the results. Pichai also said on the company&#39;s earnings call that it set &quot;a number of records this quarter.&quot; Publisher partners earned more than ever from Google&#39;s network, he said, and Alphabet has paid more to its YouTube creators and partners than any quarter in history.</p><p>Pichai also shouted out recent developments in AI across Google&#39;s portfolio, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-hands-on-181528378.html">upcoming Android 12</a>, updated <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">conversation technology LaMDA </a>and more. He also emphasized Google Cloud, detailing developments in security solutions and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-workspace-open-everyone-free-spaces-100004157.html">Workspace</a>, including the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-smart-canvas-productivity-app-172323639.html">Smart Canvas that it showed off</a> at Google I/O.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Pichai said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-available-globally-161554248.html">YouTube Shorts</a> (its TikTok-like feature) broke a new record by surpassing 15 billion daily views. YouTube subscriptions across things like Premium and Music also continue to grow. He also gave an update on self-driving vehicle company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-213249367.html">Waymo</a>, which first launched its services to the public in October 2020. Since then, it&#39;s &quot;served thousands of rides without a human driver,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, since the bulk of Alphabet&#39;s money comes from advertising, much of the earnings call dwelled on how retailers used Google&#39;s product to market their services to consumers. Chief business officer Philipp Schindler also spent some time talking about YouTube&#39;s reach, and how it&#39;s able to reach an audience that traditional TV and broadcast networks don&#39;t.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the company&#39;s Other Bets division, which covers its hardware products, cost a lot more money than it made this quarter, it&#39;s possible some of those investments will pay off in the months to come, since Google typically launches new phones in the fall. Porat closed the call with some statements on outlook, saying, &quot;We believe it&#39;s still too early to forecast the longer term trends as markets reopen, especially given the recent increase in COVID cases globally.&quot; While it&#39;s not guaranteed to continue posting super strong results for the quarters to come, we&#39;re sure Alphabet is going to be okay.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-google-earnings-q2-2021-202832294.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aac89cdd-9d8a-4b35-bd2a-a7d786283bee</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 20:28:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627419479</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T20:58:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95d5ff40-eef5-11eb-bfcd-dec53336397b" width="4388" height="2926" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95d5ff40-eef5-11eb-bfcd-dec53336397b" width="4388" height="2926" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shannon Stapleton / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The outside of Google headquarters is seen in New York City, U.S., June 17, 2021.

He was later convicted on securities fraud and securities fraud conspiracy charges and sentenced to seven years in prison. A forfeiture judgment of about $7.4 million was also made against Shkreli, and the government later seized assets to satisfy the judgment — including the album.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All of which brings us to today. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/united-states-sells-unique-wu-tang-clan-album-forfeited-convicted-hedge-fund-manager"><ins>The government has sold</ins></a><em>Once Upon a Time In Shaolin</em>. Prosecutors didn&#39;t say who bought the album or how much they paid, but the sale covers the outstanding balance Shkreli owed the government.</p><p>So, after three years of being locked in a federal vault, and almost four years of being owned by the weaselly Shkreli (who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-06-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-ebay.html"><ins>tried to sell it on eBay</ins></a> before he was incarcerated), the album is once again in private ownership. Although snippets of the album <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-09-wu-tang-ultra-rare-album-stream.html"><ins>have popped up online</ins></a>, you probably shouldn&#39;t expect it to hit Spotify any time soon, unfortunately.</p><p>One of the conditions for the auction sale was that the buyer couldn&#39;t use it for commercial purposes until 2103. It&#39;s unclear whether that stipulation is still in place, but Shkreli was allowed to play it at listening parties. Maybe the new proprietor of <em>Once Upon a Time In Shaolin </em>will feel generous enough to play it for Wu-Tang fans somewhere.

According to a <a href="https://tech.fb.com/community-letter/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> from Andrew Bosworth, head of Facebook’s Reality Labs, “a very small percentage” of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Quest 2</a> owners have experienced some amount of skin irritation after using the removable foam face insert that comes with every Quest 2 headset and Fit Pack.</p><p>Bosworth says Facebook conducted a review of its manufacturing process and found no unexpected or hazardous contaminants in the insert. Still, out of a desire to create  “safe and unbelievable experiences for all,” the company is introducing a new silicone cover that fits over the component. Whether you’ve had issues with the insert or not, you can request that Facebook send you the silicone cover for free. To do so, go to the “My Devices” section of your <a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/removable-facial-interface-alert/"><ins>account page</ins></a> and click the dedicated button that’s there.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook is also halting sales of the Oculus Quest temporarily while it works with distributors to add the silicone cover to every Quest 2 package. The company anticipates the headset will be back on store shelves by August 24th. As part of today’s recall, Facebook is also introducing a new 128GB variant of the Oculus Quest 2. It will replace the existing 64GB model, and feature the same $299 price tag as its predecessor. The 128GB model will go on sale on August 24th, the same day the company plans to restart Quest 2 sales.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/quest-2-foam-facial-interface-recall-163432642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2aac1db1-10fc-40be-8020-69c05893639b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:34:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627403677</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T16:34:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0c308010-eef7-11eb-bf95-d05c8071270a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0c308010-eef7-11eb-bf95-d05c8071270a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2 foam insert]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2 foam insert]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix turned a Twitter account into an animated show]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yet another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> account has been turned into a TV show. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix"><ins>Netflix</ins></a> has adapted Chicago Party Aunt (<a href="https://twitter.com/ChiPartyAunt"><ins>@ChiPartyAunt</ins></a>) into an adult animated series of the same name.</p><p>Actor Chris Witaske, who&#39;s perhaps best known for his role in Netflix series <em>Love</em>, is behind the account.

Last week, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-tv-update-features-from-google-tv-160004195.html">Android TV</a> exported some of Google TV&#39;s best features including a watchlist, recommended tuning and detail pages. Now, it&#39;s the turn of the Google TV app on Android, formerly Play Movies &amp; TV, an all-round entertainment hub for streaming, buying and renting movies and TV shows. Courtesy of a new update, the app is getting a fresh design and a raft of new reality, global and live TV programming.</p><p>As if the branding wasn&#39;t convoluted enough, to make things more complicated the service is only available in the US. For everyone else, there&#39;s the Play Movies &amp; TV app, which is limited to digital downloads.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With that out of the way, let&#39;s take a closer look at the new stuff.

Google is emphasising movie and TV shows with 16:9 widescreen posters, below which you can find Rotten Tomatoes scores. The company has also improved its discovery algorithm that matches movie and shows to your tastes. You can put it to the test by scouring the new rows of personalized recommendations, including new sub-genres like sci-fi thrillers and summer blockbusters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-tv-update-android-160044153.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6d9c9772-7944-4476-bd5d-4b91c46200ab</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627382415</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T10:40:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/672bbde0-eec5-11eb-98fe-2fbf74880168" width="2880" height="1800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/672bbde0-eec5-11eb-98fe-2fbf74880168" width="2880" height="1800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pinterest is giving creators ways to make money on the platform]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pinterest influencers might soon be able to make a living directly from the platform.

Creators can use affiliate links to receive a cut of sales generated though their Idea Pins.</p><p>Pinterest is adding another feature to Idea Pins — a &quot;paid partnerships&quot; label for creators who share branded content. Influencers who create content on behalf of a company can tag the brand in Idea Pins. Once the brand gives the tag the green light, the label will appear. The aim is to improve transparency and make it easier for creators to disclose paid partnerships.</p><p>“Pinterest is the place where creators with inspiring and actionable ideas get discovered,&quot; Aya Kanai, Pinterest head of content and creator partnerships, said in a statement. &quot;With this latest update, we’re empowering Creators to reach millions of shoppers on the platform and monetize their work. Creators deserve to be rewarded for the inspiration they deliver to their followers, and the sales they drive for brands.&quot;</p><p>Product tagging on Idea Pins will initially be available on business accounts in the US and UK. The feature will hit other markets in the coming months. As for paid partnerships, select Pinterest users in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru now have access.</p><p>Other visually focused platforms are focusing on ways to help influencers earn a living (and, crucially, to dissuade them from moving elsewhere). In April, it emerged Instagram is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creator-shops-content-marketplace-190211314.html"><ins>working on Creator Shops</ins></a> as well as a “branded content marketplace” amid Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html"><ins>$1 billion push</ins></a> to court influencers.

Alternatively, you can start one from scratch by tapping the “+” icon in the chat bar and then selecting the “Create Thread” option. Either way, you can see all the threads you’re currently taking part in on the sidebar. When you open a thread from a chat channel log, it will appear in another side panel to the right of the interface so you can follow both conversations at the same time. By default, threads will automatically archive after 24 hours. The idea behind the time limit is to keep channels clutter-free, according to Discord.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="155a76655b05410f857c29f3e78ef4cf"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8IjA9Zeong?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>If you’re on a server people with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-stickers-135019389.html">Nitro subscriptions</a> have boosted to level two, you’ll also have the option to take part in private threads. These won’t appear in a server’s channel listing, and the only way to take part in one is if someone invites you to the conversation. Boosted channels can also make it so that threads archive up to one week after they’re started, instead of 24 hours after the fact. With the introduction of threads, Discord is also adding new permissions. Channel owners can decide who can take part in both public and private threads and manage them as needed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Discord is starting the rollout of threads today. Community servers can enable the feature early. On August 17th, however, the company plans to enable threads across all servers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/discord-threads-150018618.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20dac71b-0512-488c-9894-220b3cd4b535</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 15:00:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627398300</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T15:05:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/87fc27b0-eedb-11eb-b1ea-83a48cfa5e6b" width="1600" height="1137" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/87fc27b0-eedb-11eb-b1ea-83a48cfa5e6b" width="1600" height="1137" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Discord]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Discord threads]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Discord threads]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Waze will warn you about traffic jams and detours before you drive]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Waze can be helpful for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-10-waze-esri-live-traffic-data-for-us-cities.html">dodging gridlock</a> and other headaches while you drive, but now it&#39;s helping you make a more informed choice before you start moving.

At the same time, it&#39;s roughly based on the A5000 and A6000-series APS-C mirrorless cameras, with all the good (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-sony-a6600-review-misstep.html">and bad</a>) that entails.&nbsp;</p><p>The two biggest advantages of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ZV-E10" href="https://fave.co/3zDUlVC">ZV-E10</a> over the ZV-1 are the larger 24-megapixel APS-C sensor and interchangeable mirrorless mount. The latter feature opens Sony&#39;s range of 60-plus E-mount lenses to vloggers, making the ZV-E10 much more versatile than the fixed-lens ZV-1. The larger sensor, meanwhile, will deliver improved light sensitivity and a shallower depth of field.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5a2c85b0-eee9-11eb-95fc-42d0c478637e" alt="Sony&#x002019;s ZV-E10 brings interchangeable lenses to its vlogging camera series" data-uuid="d04ce3e2-4e92-347a-a93e-fcca1a041240"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The ZV-E10 uses the aging 24-megapixel APS-C sensor found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-sony-a6100-review.html">A6100</a> and other recent Sony models. While that delivers sharp, downsampled 4K video at up to 30 fps (or 120 fps 1080p), it&#39;s likely to have a serious amount of rolling shutter that&#39;s not ideal for its intended purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>On the more positive side, it offers active electronic image stabilization and optical stabilization via supported lenses (though not in-body stabilization). That should smooth out handheld shooting pretty well, though don&#39;t expect miracles for walk-and-talk type vlogging — especially if rolling sensor wobble proves to be an issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Size-wise, the ZV-E10 is smaller than any of the A6000-series cameras at 343 grams and isn&#39;t much larger and heavier than the ZV-1. It lacks an electronic viewfinder, but it&#39;s Sony&#39;s first APS-C mirrorless camera with a fully-articulating flip-out screen — a basic requirement on any vlogging camera these days.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64212810-eee8-11eb-baff-b61f12e08d82" alt="Sony&#x002019;s ZV-E10 brings interchangeable lenses to its vlogging camera series" data-uuid="e242a174-5557-3063-9622-1bdd40262cda"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The ZV-E10 comes with Sony&#39;s latest phase-detect autofocus system, both for video and still shooting. That means you should get incredibly quick subject tracking, along with reliable eye, face and head detect autofocus. It also has an S&amp;Q (slow &amp; quick) feature that lets you record time-lapse and slow motion footage in-camera without the need for any post processing work.</p><p>It borrows several vlogging features directly from the ZV-1. The first is called &quot;product showcase,&quot; a setting that allows it to instantly focus away from your face and onto an object placed in front of the camera. That&#39;s particularly handy for vloggers reviewing products, devices, etc.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/de3ea450-eee9-11eb-badf-efa54e3b6749" alt="Sony&#x002019;s ZV-E10 brings interchangeable lenses to its vlogging camera series" data-uuid="43426e1f-731f-31f6-b8aa-bd63c22d7c1b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>The other is a bokeh switch that instantly sets the lowest f-stop available for lighting conditions. That way, you can have the background as defocused as possible, allowing your subject to stand out clearly.&nbsp;</p><p>The ZV-E10 has a built-in, high-quality three-way microphone (left, right and central channels) that&#39;s designed to pick out your voice. That means you can vlog without the need to buy a microphone, though it still won&#39;t match the quality and voice isolation of a dedicated shotgun or lapel mic.</p><p>It also comes with a  hotshoe-attached muff to help block wind noise, and if that&#39;s not enough, a wind noise reduction setting. If you do plan to use your own microphone, it comes with both mic and headphone inputs, and the hotshoe supports Sony&#39;s dedicated digital, multi-channel microphones.&nbsp;</p><div id="561a7b106b7f491595c32d1e71c4081e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z48-5QGetTE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>As for battery life, Sony claims you can shoot for 80 minutes on a charge or 440 photos. With the small body, it has just a single SD card slot and only supports UHS-I speeds — not ideal for burst photo shooting, but fine for Sony&#39;s relatively low XAVC video data rates.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, if you&#39;re into live streaming, you can connect the ZV-E10 directly to a smartphone via the USB-C port and stream directly to YouTube or other services — much as you can with Panasonic&#39;s latest GH5-II. It will also work directly as a webcam, streaming both video and audio (not just video like other cameras) so you can take advantage of its high-quality microphone.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ZV-E10" href="https://fave.co/3zDUlVC">ZV-E10</a> will be available in either black or white by the end of August and will cost $700 for the body, or $800 in a bundle including Sony&#39;s 16-50mm F/3.5-5.6 power zoom lens.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-expands-its-vlogging-lineup-with-the-zv-e-10-mirrorless-camera-142731045.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">577fe4f2-52a3-44c5-9a74-779ead57cb8f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:27:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627402034</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T16:07:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a768330-eeec-11eb-9fbf-1ce709229319" width="2500" height="1579" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a768330-eeec-11eb-9fbf-1ce709229319" width="2500" height="1579" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony mirrorless ZV-E10]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony mirrorless ZV-E10]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AZIO’s colorful IZO collection looks great (and that’s about it)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With tech pretty much everywhere in our lives these days, some people would prefer it matched their personal style and decor.

I opted to receive my review units in “baroque rose” because it really is a nice shade of pink, in contrast to the bubble gum shades favored by companies like Razer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d8204ed0-ebeb-11eb-bf98-a6529571c374" alt="Mouse, keypad, keyboard" data-uuid="d64acaec-1691-3efc-b695-1085ff682358"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Regardless of which color you choose, each accessory is embellished with gold accents The keyboard, media dial, escape key and spacebar are all gilded and glossy. They stand out against the matte plastic used on the rest of the deck, and not in a good way. I also suspect that after several months of use, the coating is going to wear away and it’s not going to be pretty.</p><p>The keys are squircle shaped and lightly textured, so they at least feel nice to the touch. The typing… isn’t horrible. It’s actually perfectly fine, with good tactile bounce and a soft click with every press. But despite the blue mechanical switches it still feels a bit spongy compared to the other decks I have here in my office. I’m typing this hands-on with the IZO and it’s fine, but given a choice I’d switch back to my standards in a heartbeat. The IZO feels like a toy, which is disconcerting when I’m here to work. It’s a tenkeyless deck, which makes it great for tight spaces and taking on the go, though I wouldn’t slip it in my bag for fear of scratching it up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f88d8c00-ebeb-11eb-9edf-cc7ba5a6621b" alt="AZIO IZO keyboard in pink" data-uuid="ea78ee88-f5fa-3c88-98a6-e270d5ef62e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you need a number pad, that’ll cost extra. Seventy dollars is kind of steep for those 18 extra keys, and the fact that it can also be used as a calculator doesn’t make the cost sting any less.I will say this for it, though: I love this thing. Not because I use the number pad to do calculations (though I do), but because it’s just so fun to play with. I don’t have it connected or even turned on right now, I just like to randomly pick it up in both hands and play with the buttons. I may find the typing experience a little subpar, but as a fidget toy the numpad is great because it’s just so chunky and clicky, perfect for keeping my hands busy during boring Zoom calls.</p><p>The final piece of the set is the wireless mouse, the most beautiful of the three desk accessories. It’s a rounded rectangular shape, with a gold scroll wheel and stripe across the middle of the mouse, below which is a frosted white plastic bearing the AZIO logo. This is the kind of mouse that could strut around Milan Fashion Week or the beach at Ibiza. Unfortunately, it’s pretty bad as a computing accessory.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/17457810-ebec-11eb-bed7-77d267021af3" alt="AZIO IZO mouse in pink" data-uuid="420226aa-020e-303e-aff5-680eca33dcb8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s the hand feel that’s an immediate turnoff. Where most mice curve inward and down on the end facing the user, the better to fit in your palm, the AZIO mouse is straight all the way down, with the rear of the mouse at the same height as the middle. It’s actually one of the smallest mice I’ve tested, but it feels huge in my hand. That’s a big no-no considering it’s a fashion peripheral, presumably meant to appeal to women, who usually have smaller mitts than men.</p><p>The design faux pas don’t end there, either. The DPI button is placed on the bottom of the mouse and it’s a tiny little nub that’s hard to hit, so once you’ve picked a setting you’ll probably want to stick with it. And the pads on bottom have a little too much friction on them to slide across my desk easily. I probably should use a mouse pad with this thing but I haven’t needed one in almost a decade and I don’t see why I should go back now.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/344c31b0-ebec-11eb-bd7b-d68e796f48c5" alt="AZIO IZO keypad in pink" data-uuid="4bb8ed89-0108-3aec-bc5d-5854cedd0cee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>I wouldn’t recommend the mouse and the cost of the number pad is a bit too steep for me to tell you to buy it — even at the currently discounted price of $40. The keyboard is also on sale for $80, which is a little more tempting. But if the color was your main reason for buying it, note that Logitech’s K380 comes in a fetching pale pink, can connect to up to three devices wirelessly and is only <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Logitech K380" href="https://amzn.to/3kQ9CyC">$40</a>. You also have your choice of mice to match, including the stellar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/logitech-mx-anywhere-3-mouse-price-specs-availability-070104068.html">MX Anywhere 3</a>. The IZO collection is for people who absolutely need to have a stylish <em>mechanical</em> keyboard — and even then, you might be better off just buying a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Corsair K70" href="https://amzn.to/2W5yjfS">white deck</a> from a company like Corsair and customizing the LEDs to your favorite shade.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/azio-izo-collection-keyboard-mouse-140016265.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93c84e38-cbe1-4944-956a-df8b2cebbfe0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 14:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627395146</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T14:12:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7efbd6c0-eee4-11eb-bfef-2237ad004883" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7efbd6c0-eee4-11eb-bfef-2237ad004883" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kris Naudus / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AZIO IZO keyboard and mouse peripherals photographed on a black cloth background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AZIO IZO keyboard and mouse]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
