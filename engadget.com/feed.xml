That&#39;s my main takeaway from <em>We Met in Virtual Reality</em>, the first documentary filmed entirely in VRChat, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival today.</p><p>There&#39;s no chance Zuck&#39;s metaverse would let people wear trademarked avatars without paying a ton, attend exotic clubs to receive (or give) virtual lapdances, or allow users to build whatever the hell they want. VRChat, as portrayed by <a href="https://joeahunting.com/"><ins>director Joe Hunting</ins></a>, is basically a proto-metaverse where anything is possible. And for many, it has served as a crucial social hub during the pandemic, a place where they can forget about the world, relax with friends and maybe find love.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But of course, that&#39;s been the nature of practically every online community. We&#39;re social animals — people have always been able to connect with each other over BBS, IRC, Usenet and the plethora of forums and chat services that populated the early internet. I spent most of the &#39;90s hanging out in anime and gaming chat rooms, the sorts of places that today&#39;s connected youth would probably find quaint. Still, the people I met there helped me survive the worst parts of middle and high school. Those relationships, and the internet itself, shaped me into who I am (for better or worse).</p><div id="668dbef7efbd4f55bc320eceb769cbab"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WSNJUngJ_fQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>We Met in Virtual Reality </em>proves that the unbridled, experimental sense of online community is still alive and well today, despite relentless consolidation from Big Tech. But now, instead of staring at tiny CRT monitors, people are slapping on VR headsets to explore fully realized environments. Hardcore VRChat users are also investing in powerful computing rigs as well as upgrades like finger and whole-body tracking. In the &#39;90s, I was grateful to get another 16MB of RAM so that I could have more than one browser window open. Today, VRChat devotees can communicate using American Sign Language, or have their anime avatars show off their belly dancing skills.</p><p>Hunting approaches his subjects with the eye of an anthropologist, without any judgment towards their sometimes ridiculous avatars (do all the anime ladies need to have jiggly, <em>Dead or Alive</em>-level boob physics?). <em>We Met in Virtual Reality</em> begins as a chill hangout flick — we follow a group of friends as they have virtual drinks and go on joyrides in crudely-built VR cars — but it quickly moves beyond the novelty of its setting. One person credits their VRChat girlfriend for helping them to &quot;unmute&quot; after being silent for two years. An exotic performer explains that being able to dance for people in VRChat helped her grieve with a family tragedy and manage a bout of alcoholism.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2d32a730-7b05-11ec-9a4e-3bac011df3b4" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="We Met in Virtual Reality" data-uuid="3a746b0e-7c27-3122-b1d5-9357971273c9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Joe Hunting</div></figure><p>The film chronicles how that exotic dancer, a young woman based in the UK, formed a romantic relationship with another VRChat user in Miami. These sorts of cyber relationships aren’t anything new, but the VR platform allowed them to do much more than trade links and memes over IM. They could exist in a space together, go on dates to new environments every night. I won’t spoil where things end up for the couple, but I can say that it wouldn’t have been nearly as effective outside of VR.</p><p><em>We Met in Virtual Reality </em>effectively conveys why people would gravitate towards VRChat, especially during a pandemic. But it doesn&#39;t fully capture the wonder of exploring these environments yourself. Seeing people hop on a virtual rollercoaster isn&#39;t nearly as thrilling as doing it, where your entire field of vision is covered and you can easily get vertigo. But I don&#39;t blame Hunting too much for that; his job was to boil down the VR experience so people can enjoy it on a 2D screen, and the film is mostly successful in that respect. The film was shot using a virtual camera that could mimic all of the functionality of a typical shooter, from focus points to aperture levels. So even though it&#39;s produced in an alien environment most people aren&#39;t familiar with, it still feels like a traditional documentary.</p><p>Hunting has spent the past few years making VR documentaries, starting with a few short films, as well as the <a href="https://joeahunting.com/virtually-speaking"><ins>series </ins><em><ins>Virtually Speaking</ins></em></a>. It’s clear from <em>We Met in Virtual Reality</em> that he’s not just dropping into the community for a quick story. Instead, he sees the humanity behind the avatars and virtual connections. These people aren&#39;t just escaping from their lives&nbsp; with VR — their lives are being made richer because of it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/we-met-in-virtual-reality-review-sundance-vrchat-234048235.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b6560be5-cca6-434f-addd-39b847d3cb3f</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 23:40:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642803302</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T22:15:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Banking & Budgeting]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2d334370-7b05-11ec-ba66-3839cce33dcf" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2d334370-7b05-11ec-ba66-3839cce33dcf" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Joe Hunting]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[We Met in Virtual Reality]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[We Met in Virtual Reality]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Robinhood opens cryptocurrency wallet to beta testers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/robinhood-cryptocurrency-wallet-test-october-190030675.html"><ins>Back in September</ins></a>, Robinhood announced plans to test a cryptocurrency wallet within its app. At the time, the company said it would open the beta to a small number of people before expanding availability ahead of a full-scale release.

Crisis Text Line can be reached by texting HOME to 741741 (US), 686868 (Canada), or 85258 (UK). Wikipedia maintains </em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines"><em>a list of crisis lines</em></a><em> for people outside of those countries.</em></p><p>A Connecticut mother has brought <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/554317526/Rodriguez-v-Meta-Snap">a lawsuit</a> against Facebook and Instagram parent company Meta, as well as Snap, claiming the platforms to cause the sort of addiction her late daughter suffered prior to taking her own life at age 11 last July.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Social media companies have been the target of various lawsuits over the years related to alleged harm to minors — oftentimes for failing to adequately prevent that harm, as in the case of teen who was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-05-10/lawsuit-snap-teen-suicide-yolo-lmk">bullied</a> via an anonymous messaging app within Snapchat, leading to his eventual suicide. Tammy Rodriguez is instead making the case that the sort of &quot;stickiness&quot; these platforms are built to engender is inherently harmful, especially to young users like her late daughter Selena.&nbsp;</p><p>Selena &quot;struggled for more than two years with an extreme addiction to Instagram and Snapchat,&quot; the suit notes, a claim apparently backed by an outpatient therapist who had &quot;never seen a patient as addicted to social media&quot; during their evaluation. Although technically too young to be on either platform per their terms of service — Instagram and Snapchat state their minimum age for account creation is 13 — the mother points to the absence of parental controls, as well as the lack of strong age verification checks, which made policing her daughter&#39;s access to the services nearly impossible. &quot;The only way for Tammy Rodriguez to effectively limit access to Defendants’ products would be to physically confiscate Selena’s internet-enabled devices,&quot; the suit claims, &quot;which simply caused Selena to run away in order to access her social media accounts on other devices.&quot;</p><p>Use of the services, Rodriguez alleges, caused her daughter to suffer from depression, sleep deprivation, school absences, eating disorders, self-harm and led to her eventual suicide.&nbsp;</p><p>Rodriguez argues that Snapchat&#39;s &quot;unknown and changing rewards&quot; are &quot;akin to a slot machine but marketed toward teenage users who are even more susceptible than gambling addicts.&quot; Similarly, Instagram&#39;s design decisions &quot;seek to exploit users’ susceptibility to persuasive design and unlimited accumulation of unpredictable and uncertain rewards,&quot; in the form of likes and followers. These features, it&#39;s argued, are highly detrimental to teen and pre-teen users whose brains are still not fully developed, particularly in the realms of &quot;impulse control and risk evaluation.&quot;</p><p>The claim mirrors, as well as quotes from, some of the concerns <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks">voiced</a> by whistleblower Francis Haugen. Among the tranche of documents released to news organizations by Haugen was internal research showing that Instagram might be harmful to the well-being of users, especially young girls, as well as internal documents describing the loss of of this user cohort as an “existential threat” to the business. The effects of Instagram on children&#39;s well-being is also the subject of a current <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/18/state-attorneys-general-instagram/">investigation</a> by a bipartisan coalition of Attorneys General.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We&#39;ve reached out to Snap and Meta for comment and will update if we hear back.</p><p><strong>Update 1/21/22 5:17pm ET:</strong> &quot;We are devastated to hear of Selena’s passing and our hearts go out to her family,&quot; a Snap spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;While we can’t comment on the specifics of active litigation, nothing is more important to us than the wellbeing of our community.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-snap-suicide-lawsuit-selena-rodriguez-213057362.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa49acec-4d7d-4868-9700-f897a21b9cc3</guid><dc:creator>Bryan Menegus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 21:30:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642803588</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T22:19:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Bryan Menegus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/700e94f0-4230-11ec-bb58-642bec1a4f91" width="5221" height="3429" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/700e94f0-4230-11ec-bb58-642bec1a4f91" width="5221" height="3429" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Woman holds smartphone with Meta logo in front of a displayed Facebook's new rebrand logo Meta in this illustration picture taken October 28, 2021.

And there’s a lot to unpack here. Through the machinations of Q, Picard and the crew of the La Sirena find themselves in 2024. Setting season two of the series in the near future may seem like lazy writing, but if you’ve seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ds9-kingdom-solar-opposites-170043593.html"><em><ins>Deep Space Nine</ins></em></a>, you know that’s an important year in Star Trek’s in-universe history that the franchise has explored in the past.</p><div id="44dc030a529c472888f40823f182e5f4"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Welcome to the road not taken.&nbsp;💫&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarTrekPicard?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StarTrekPicard</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StarTrek?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#StarTrek</a><a href="https://t.co/bpxokj5q5H">https://t.co/bpxokj5q5H</a><a href="https://t.co/lOquhyR2PC">pic.twitter.com/lOquhyR2PC</a></p>— Star Trek (@StarTrek) <a href="https://twitter.com/StarTrek/status/1484586779919405062?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>In “Past Tense,” a two-episode arc from season three of <em>DS9</em>, a transporter anomaly (what else?) sends Commander Sisko, Dr. Bashir and Jadzia Dax to San Francisco circa the early 21st century. After the police leave him and Bashir in the city’s “Sanctuary District,” a ghetto that houses San Francisco’s poor and sick away from its more well-off citizens, Sisko realizes they’ve arrived on Earth days before the <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bell_Riots"><ins>Bell Riots</ins></a>, a moment that’s pivotal to Star Trek’s worldbuilding. And it’s likely that moment Picard references at the start of the trailer. “There are some moments that haunt us all our lives,” he says. “Moments upon which history turns.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The two episodes that make up “Past Tense” are widely considered some of the best the franchise has to offer, in large part because they <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/10/star-trek-deep-space-nine-past-tense/542280/"><ins>directly address economic and racial injustice in American society</ins></a>. It’s hard to say if <em>Picard</em> will have something meaningful to add to that conversation, but it’s clear that’s part of the intent here. At the very least, fans can look forward to a cameo from Whoopi Goldberg’s Guinan.</p><p>In the US, season two of <em>Star Trek: Picard </em>will debut on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-live-channels-star-trek-survivor-spongebob-squarepants-163257829.html">Paramount+</a> on March 3rd.

It has requested that a federal court dismiss four of the six charges with prejudice, which would prevent them from being brought back to the same court.</p><p>&quot;The complaint misrepresents our business, products and motives, and we are moving to dismiss it based on its failure to offer plausible antitrust claims,&quot; Adam Cohen, Google&#39;s director of economic policy, <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/ag-paxtons-false-claims-still-dont-add-up/"><ins>wrote in a blog post</ins></a>. The company says the plaintiffs failed to provide evidence of wrongdoing for several of their allegations and that much of the suit &quot;is based on outdated information that bears no correlation to our current products or business in this dynamic industry (and in any event never amounted to a violation of antitrust laws).&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The AGs, who are led by Texas AG Ken Paxton, claimed Google abused its power to shore up its position in the online ads market. They said the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-google-jedi-blue-ad-deal-165604926.html"><ins>agreed a &quot;sweetheart deal&quot; in 2018</ins></a> that gave Facebook parent Meta a boost in ad header bidding (a type of tech allows publishers to solicit bids from multiple ad exchanges simultaneously) in exchange for support for Google&#39;s Open Bidding method of selling ads.</p><p>Google said the deal was above board and that it wasn&#39;t a secret, as Facebook Audience Network (FAN) was <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/admob/latest-admob-updates-making-more-money-mobile-app-ads/?fbclid=IwAR3dY0kup3tTR1O_1dAHDaKecUUS-aduWQb_W_MNF-7VZVV3n0E55Ryaovc">one of several partners</a> for its Open Bidding program. Cohen said the deal &quot;does not provide FAN with an advantage in the Open Bidding auction. FAN competes in the auction just like other bidders: FAN must make the highest bid to win a given impression, period. If another eligible network or exchange bids higher, they win the auction.&quot;</p><p>The AGs also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-antitrust-suit-amended-chrome-privacy-sandbox-texas-193709103.html"><ins>alleged</ins></a> that Google harnessed at least three programs to manipulate ad auctions. The aim, according to the states, was to push publishers and advertisers into using the company&#39;s own tools.</p><p>&quot;State Plaintiffs respond to Google’s success by seeking to compel Google to share with its competitors the fruits of its investments and innovation,&quot; Google wrote in its filing. &quot;They criticize Google for not designing its products to better suit its rivals’ needs and for making improvements to those products that leave its competitors too far behind. They see the &#39;solution&#39; to Google’s success as holding Google back, rather than letting market forces urge its competitors forward.&quot;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-asks-judge-dismiss-most-texas-antitrust-lawsuit-2022-01-21/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a> notes, the two other charges in the suit are based on state law and were stayed in September. Although Google hasn&#39;t asked for those to be dismissed, it reserved the right to make that request at a later date.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-antitrust-lawsuit-motion-to-dismiss-charges-194011413.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bc23b76-2af0-469e-ac7d-a5929cc5dffc</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 19:40:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642795119</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T19:59:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b48a2e0-46da-11ec-bce5-f80a6ed0fd8d" width="4676" height="3118" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b48a2e0-46da-11ec-bce5-f80a6ed0fd8d" width="4676" height="3118" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shannon Stapleton / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A sign is seen at the entrance to the Google retail store in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, U.S., June 17, 2021.

However, the big deal for kaiju-lovers is that the upcoming Godzilla show on Apple TV+ will be the first live-action series set in the MonsterVerse, and only the second TV show following the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tomb-raider-netflix-anime-skull-island-164800086.html"><ins>Skull Island anime on Netflix.</ins></a></p><p>Currently, it’s unclear how the new Apple TV+ series will tie into existing MonsterVerse movies – particularly last year’s <em>Godzilla vs. Kong </em>which saw the big green dino team up with King Kong to battle a range of foes both ancient and modern. And despite 2019’s <em>Godzilla: King of the Monsters</em> sometimes being deemed a disappointment due to middling ticket sales, <em>Godzilla vs. Kong</em> still managed to become one of the top 10 box office draws of 2021 while in the midst of a pandemic, which looks like a good sign ahead of Godzilla’s upcoming move to the small screen.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/godzilla-is-headed-to-apple-tv-in-the-monster-verses-first-live-action-series-181010114.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c055ad08-2a92-49d4-95b1-ca535d294a04</guid><dc:creator>Sam Rutherford</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 18:10:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642788610</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T18:10:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Sam Rutherford]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d16b6010-7ae4-11ec-bf9f-eb33b1461c99" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d16b6010-7ae4-11ec-bf9f-eb33b1461c99" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Legendary/Warner Bros.]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Godzilla battles King Kong in 2021's Godzilla vs. Kong]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Godzilla battles King Kong in 2021's Godzilla vs. Kong]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A group of Activision Blizzard workers is unionizing]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/call%20of%20duty%20warzone/"><em><ins>Call of Duty: Warzone</ins></em></a> quality assurance workers at Activision Blizzard studio Raven Software have announced plans to unionize with the Communication Workers of America (CWA).

It was envisioned as a reboot of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-07-11-windows-phone-support-ends.html">Windows Phone</a> with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-26-microsoft-andromeda-courier-digital-notebook.html"><ins>emphasis on inking</ins></a>. The company worked on the software until it eventually decided to instead include Android on the Surface Duo. Until now, we’ve only seen glimpses of Andromeda in things like patent filing. But <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/andromeda-os-hands-video"><em>Windows Central</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>recently<em>&nbsp;</em>obtained an internal build of the operating system and installed it on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-27-microsoft-lumia-950-review.html"><ins>Lumia 950</ins></a>.</p><div id="c5a8f57d92f343c987c22d6e3e3c7a07"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmfsHI_NSwc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Outside of a rare look at an unfinished project, what’s interesting about seeing Andromeda after all these years is how many of the ideas Microsoft was working on then either made their way to the Surface Duo or apps the company has released since. On the lock screen, for instance, you can see an early version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-26-surface-duo-peek-notification-feature.html"><ins>Surface Duo’s peek functionality</ins></a>. Meanwhile, a lot of the features you see on the “Journal” home screen eventually made their way to the company’s Whiteboard app, and that’s something you can download from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-12-microsoft-collaborative-whiteboard-app-available.html"><ins>Microsoft Store</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, it’s an interesting look at what could have been. Even in the software’s unfinished state, there’s a lot we see in the video that’s genuinely different from anything Android and iOS offer, even to this day. The fact Andromeda allowed you to jot down notes directly on the lock screen, and that they would still be there the next time you unlocked the phone, is something that looks genuinely useful.</p><p>Of course, there are probably many good reasons Microsoft ultimately decided not to pursue Andromeda. Launching a device that does something different, let alone a completely new operating system, is no easy task in a mature marketplace. Unless a device does nearly everything right, it’s difficult to overcome the fact most people tend to stick with products they know and are comfortable with.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-andromeda-hands-on-video-172643314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45ed018f-922e-4637-8bb5-b575dd11ddf0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 17:26:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642786006</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T17:26:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4597b170-3204-11ec-b73f-a639b873239c" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4597b170-3204-11ec-b73f-a639b873239c" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person holding the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 in book mode showing the Engadget home page.

But <a href="https://www.germanbionic.com/en/">German Bionic</a> claims only one of them is intelligent enough to learn from its users’ mistaken movements: its 5th-generation Cray X.</p><p>The Cray X fits on workers like a 7kg backpack with hip-mounted actuators that move carbon fiber linkages strapped to the upper legs, allowing a person to easily lift and walk with up to 30kg (66 lbs) with both their legs and backs fully supported. Though it doesn’t actively assist the person’s shoulders and arms with the task, the Cray X does offer a Smart Safety Companion system to help mitigate common lifting injuries.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“It&#39;s a real time software application that runs in the background and can warn the worker when the ergonomic risk is getting too high,” Norma Steller, German Bionic’s Head of IoT, told Engadget. “For example, recommending a break because we know that… the repetition and the overall stress can lead to fatigue, and fatigue can lead to injuries. This is something we want to prevent.”</p><p>The SSC not only collects granular telemetry information — what load is being lifted, ergonomic risks such as twisting while lifting, and potential environmental factors — it uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze that data to adapt the exoskeleton to the worker wearing it via OTA software updates. Not only is this data displayed to the workers themselves on an attached monitor, the Cray X also transmits that data up the supervisory chain allowing managers to monitor the movements of their employees to ensure that they are not overexerting themselves.</p><p>“Since we are collecting every single step and every single lift, the data that we provide is much more accurate,” Steller noted. The data the Cray collects is gathered from real-world use, not lab tests or supervised trials where workers are on their best ergonomic behavior. “Especially in logistics, every single step, every single lift, every single trend is usually planned. But sometimes in the real world, not every plan comes to fulfillment and then we suddenly see workplace performance drop very, very quickly. And with the data we provide, you can actually do an investigation and figure out why [that drop off is occurring].”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9b5848c0-7ae0-11ec-b4d7-376290a4e463" style="height:4002;width:6000;" alt="The Cray X 5th Generation exoskeleton" data-uuid="931dfd1c-596c-392f-97a8-0bf6b89384d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">German Bionic</div></figure><p>Steller sees the Cray X as a &quot;preventative device&quot; designed to ensure workers don&#39;t overextend or overexert themselves. “We are a preventative device, so we are preventing injury,” Steller added. “We&#39;re not considered a medical [device manufacturer]. We consider ourselves an exoskeleton for industrial use.” As such, the Cray X is <a href="https://www.coolstuffshub.com/ip-rating-guide/#:~:text=A%20product%20with%20an%20IP54,of%20water%20from%20any%20angle.">IP54 rated</a> for dust and moisture so it can work in all but the dingiest of warehouse environments.</p><p>And though the Cray X is designed to be put on and taken off in under a minute, it can be worn for up to a full work shift without being removed thanks to the 5th generation’s new hot-swappable 40V battery system.</p><p>“We implemented the hot swapping function so that you can just drop it on the spot without having to turn off the device,” Marius Kiss, Head of Mechanical R&amp;D at German Bionic, told Engadget. “You can pull out the [spent battery] for a new one, place the old one on the charger — we use the Makita fast charging stations which charge the battery in like 30 to 40 minutes — and then you can just move on. You could potentially work like eight hours without having to take off the exoskeleton.”</p><p>For as useful as the current generation of exoskeletal technologies are today, the German Bionic team sees them becoming even more capable, and widespread, in the years ahead. “My feeling is that we will see much more specialized exoskeletons in the future because the technology is more available.” Steller said. “I think they will enter our world, not only in the B2B industrial sectors. We will see them basically everywhere because we have the chance to augment our body and usually humans take the chance to do that. We will see them everywhere, without any real limitation but very specialized to the use case.”</p><p>“I really see everyone on the street wearing an exoskeleton in one form or another,” Eric Eitel, German Bionic’s Head of Communications, added. “But I think that the exoskeletons that we are looking for in the future are the active ones. I see them being a lot slimmer, smarter and connected.”</p><p>And even as the technology expands to consumer uses, Eitel believes exoskeletons will likely remain a common sight in industrial settings. “There are still a lot of workspaces that cannot be automated and I think that&#39;s going to stay like that for a long time. You still have to rely on people so we don&#39;t want to replace all the humans.

It wasn&#39;t exactly due to the content of their videos, however, but because some of the group&#39;s members were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oath-keepers-leader-charged-capitol-breach-211007516.html">charged</a> with seditious conspiracy over their role in the January 6th, 2021 US Capitol breach. One of the deactivated channels was named &quot;Oath Keepers&quot; and had fewer than 45,000 subscribers, while the other belonged to group leader Stewart Rhodes and had fewer than 20 subscribers. Rhodes (pictured above) was arrested for his role in the attack and was one of the members who were charged.</p><p>YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi told <em>Axios</em> that the channels broke the platform&#39;s creator responsibility guidelines. According to those guidelines, YouTube may terminate a channel if there&#39;s &quot;significant evidence presented in a court of law against a creator for a very egregious crime&quot; and that channel&#39;s &quot;YouTube comment is closely related to the crime.&quot; YouTube said that the termination &quot;follows evidence presented in federal indictments against the Oath Keepers and the charges against them and their role in the Jan. 6 attacks.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the Justice Department, the Oath Keepers discussed their plans to seize the Capitol building using encrypted messaging apps and social networks. The group has long used online platforms to disseminate information, including COVID-19 conspiracy theories with QAnon hashtags and threats of violence. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-the-oath-keepers-211426663.html">banned</a> the group back in 2020 for violating its policies on violent extremist groups. In addition to removing two channels, YouTube will no longer allow the Oath Keepers to create, use or own any other channel. Further, it will remove re-uploads of its old videos and will even delete new channels that try to reuse content from the deleted accounts.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-deactivates-oath-keepers-channels-130509458.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3db3a7e-8cc7-41cc-b25e-34f3084adbd7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 13:05:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642769058</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T12:44:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/914857a0-757a-11ec-b77d-d2154bde45d4" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/914857a0-757a-11ec-b77d-d2154bde45d4" width="4032" height="3024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[The Washington Post via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[FORT WORTH, TX - FEBRUARY 28: Stewart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers, told The Washington Post via Getty Images, February 28, 2021 in Fort Worth, Texas, that the government is trying to inflate the rogue actions of a few members into an alleged conspiracy committed by the organization on Jan. 6, 2021.

The doctors have transplanted kidneys from a genetically altered pig into the abdomen of a brain-dead man, and as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/health/transplants-pig-human-kidney.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> has reported, the procedure was described in a paper published in the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16930">American Journal of Transplantation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the doctors, the kidneys from the pig started producing urine as soon as 23 minutes after the procedure and continued to do so for three days. The patient&#39;s kidneys were fully removed, and his body didn&#39;t show signs of rejecting the transplanted organs. This is the latest in a series of developments wherein  organs from genetically altered pigs were successfully transplanted into humans. In late 2021, NYU Langone Health doctors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/health/kidney-transplant-pig-human.html">attached</a> a pig kidney onto the blood vessels of a brain-dead patient&#39;s upper leg. And, just a few days ago, doctors at the University of Maryland School of Medicine <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pig-heart-transplant-successful-224645097.html">transplanted</a> a pig&#39;s heart into a live patient as part of an experimental procedure.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The UAB surgeons performed the procedure with consent from the family of the recipient, James Parsons, who wanted to be an organ donor. They&#39;re now naming this type of study after him. While the recipient was brain dead in this case, it&#39;s a big step toward a clinical trial involving live patients that they&#39;re hoping would start later this year.

Intel&#39;s initial plans include building two semiconductor fabrication plants (or fabs) on the property that would employ 3,000 people. Construction on the site is scheduled to begin this year, and Intel expects the fabs to be operational by 2025.</p><p>A <em>Bloomberg</em> report back in late 2021 claimed that the White House &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-white-house-discouraged-intel-chip-factory-161435175.html">strongly discouraged</a>&quot; Intel from ramping up chip production in China. The administration has been pushing for companies to manufacture chips in the US in order to address the ongoing global shortage. In turn, companies have been lobbying the president to fund semiconductor research and manufacturing. It&#39;s worth noting, though, that since building new plants takes years, projects like this won&#39;t be able to help address supply chain shortages anytime soon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Intel said it looked at 38 different sites in the US for the facility but ultimately chose Ohio, because of all the space it could use. The company doesn&#39;t want to build in places where it could displace residents, since that&#39;s what ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-14-amazon-cancels-new-york-hq2.html">killed</a> Amazon&#39;s plans to build a second headquarters in NYC. When the fabs are done, Intel will use them to manufacture both its own chips and chips for clients under the Intel Foundry Services. The company announced its foundry services when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">revealed</a> that it&#39;s building two factories in Arizona, which will also cost Intel $20 billion, back in March 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Gelsinger, the chipmaker has the option to expand the Ohio site to 2,000 acres and to build as many as eight fabs in the future. &quot;We helped to establish the Silicon Valley,&quot; the CEO told <em>Time</em>. &quot;Now we’re going to do the Silicon Heartland.&quot;</p><p><strong>Update 01/21/22 3:45PM ET:</strong> Intel has officially published a press release confirming that it&#39;s building a new &quot;mega-site&quot; in Ohio. The whole project, if the company decides to expand its initial plans and build more fabs, could be worth up to $100 billion over the next decade.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-ichip-making-facility-in-ohio-073608482.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0497dfc8-b03c-4ed1-b0a8-94f5f2578de4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 07:36:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642760666</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T10:24:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/92d01e60-7a83-11ec-bfab-5bf52a37bae7" width="1600" height="1016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/92d01e60-7a83-11ec-bfab-5bf52a37bae7" width="1600" height="1016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram will now reduce the visibility of 'potentially harmful' content]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is taking new steps to make <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/how-we-address-harmful-content-on-feed"><ins>“potentially harmful”</ins></a> content less visible in its app. The company says that the algorithm powering the way posts are ordered in users’ feeds and in Stories will now de-prioritize content that “may contain bullying, hate speech or may incite violence.”</p><p>While Instagram’s rules already prohibit much of this type of content, the change could affect borderline posts, or content that hasn’t yet reached the app’s moderators. “To understand if something may break our rules, we&#39;ll look at things like if a caption is similar to a caption that previously broke our rules,” the company explains in an update.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Up until now, Instagram has tried <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-instagram-reveal-content-recommendation-guidelines-130011327.html"><ins>to hide</ins></a> potentially objectionable content from public-facing parts of the app, like Explore, but hasn’t changed how it appears to users who follow the accounts posting this type of content.
