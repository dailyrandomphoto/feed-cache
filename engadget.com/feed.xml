To stand out from its bigger rival, the soccer franchise is adopting a new name, <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/eu/en/topics/15974/"><em>eFootball</em></a><em>,</em> and going free-to-play on consoles, PC and mobile.&nbsp;</p><p>Clearly, this isn&#39;t a one-off. Konami has rebuilt the game using Unreal engine as part of the shift to providing a digital service. The biggest change to gameplay is the new &quot;motion matching&quot; technology designed to make player animations more realistic. Gamers will choose from different movements in real-time during matches. Seeing as the original Pro Evo&#39;s gameplay is what helped to distinguish it from FIFA, motion matching could prove a make or break feature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8b20117749394526b10d12d2bd9b615d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jzd7OpCHCi0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>As you&#39;d expect from an F2P title, <em>eFootball </em>will regularly receive new updates after its launch this fall. Konami will have to tread with care, however. Free-to-play games have attracted the ire of players and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-12-uk-government-loot-boxes-regulation.html">regulators</a> alike due to their exploitative nature, best summed up by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-17-loot-boxes-illegal-gambling-regulators-europe-us.html">loot boxes</a> that cost real money to obtain. The last thing the storied developer wants is to sully Pro Evo&#39;s name. Maybe, that&#39;s why it&#39;s changing it.&nbsp;</p><p>But, the news will probably raise alarm bells for fans. Konami said that only &quot;local matches&quot; featuring FC Barcelona, Juventus, FC Bayern, Manchester United &quot;and others&quot; will be available for free at launch. While, certain game modes will later be sold as optional DLC, &quot;giving players the freedom to build an experience&quot; that matches their interests. It&#39;s a major risk that Konami is banking on to restore the franchise as a regular feature in dorms and living rooms around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>The game will land in early fall with cross-generation matchmaking between current and last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Later in the fall, you can expect a managerial-style team building mode, online leagues, and a match pass system that rewards you with items and players. At the same time, cross-platform play will be introduced between consoles and PC. The winter will see the release of mobile controller support, full cross-play including mobile and the launch of professional and amateur eSports tournaments.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pro-evolution-soccer-efootball-104633019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c41fd85-e2a8-43d7-a354-8c4e23f6b04b</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:46:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626864397</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T10:47:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/08b7e2d0-ea0f-11eb-afbf-3e77b8e14559" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/08b7e2d0-ea0f-11eb-afbf-3e77b8e14559" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Konami]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Konami]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Konami]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Study suggests EVs really are cleaner than gas-powered cars over their lifespan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The lifetime emissions of an electric car versus a gasoline vehicle has become an intensely debated topic for governments. A new <a href="https://theicct.org/publications/global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021">study</a> that compares the climate impact of passenger cars could play a pivotal role in the argument. The report claims that electric cars produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions &quot;from the cradle to the grave&quot; than their gas-guzzling counterparts. According to the study, the core result is the same globally, even when applied to countries like China and India, where the majority of the electricity to recharge an EV comes from coal.</p><p>The findings are a rebuke for voices in the automotive and oil lobbying industries that still claim that electric cars are no cleaner than gas-powered vehicles. It arrives as governments are trying to cement their environmental policies in line with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-15-countries-reach-deal-to-implement-paris-climate-change-agreement.html">Paris Agreement</a>. Finalized in 2015, the climate change accord saw 143 countries, including the US, agree to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius. To help meet that target, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/washington-state-gas-car-sales-ban-2030-175652987.html">Washington</a> state and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html">California</a> have proposed banning the sale of new gasoline cars from 2030 and 2035, respectively.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The study conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) examined the entire life-cycles of EVs and gasoline cars, from extracting raw materials to production to their eventual disposal. Researchers examined the greenhouse gas emissions from the vehicle and fuel types in four territories that together account for 70 percent of new car sales worldwide: the US, the EU, China and India.</p><p>For cars registered in 2021, the report found that lifetime emissions for a medium-sized EV in Europe are between 66 and 69 percent lower compared to that of a gasoline vehicle in the same category. In the US, an EV produces between 60 to 68 percent fewer emissions. In China, an EV results in between 37 to 45 percent fewer emissions. In India, it’s between 19 to 34 percent lower.</p><p>By 2030, the gap between EVs and gas-guzzlers is tipped to increase to 74 percent to 77 percent in Europe, 62 percent to 76 percent in the US, 48 percent to 64 percent in China, and 30 percent to 56 percent in India.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the researchers assume that a vehicle will be on the road for around 18 years. They also state that the gap between the figures reflects the uncertainty around how the energy mix in each region develops, which itself is tied to future policies.</p><p>“One important result of the analysis is to show that life-cycle emissions trends are similar in all four regions, despite the differences among them in vehicle mix, grid mix, and so on. Already for cars registered today, [battery electric vehicles] have better relative [greenhouse gas] emissions performance everywhere than conventional vehicles,” said ICCT deputy director Rachel Muncrief.</p><p>There are still caveats, however. Though EVs cut back on carbon emissions over time, they inevitably take a toll on the environment. By one recent <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/green-electric-vehicle-170633036.html">estimate</a>, you&#39;ll need to drive a new EV thirteen and a half thousand miles before you&#39;re doing less harm than a gas-guzzling saloon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ev-cleaner-gas-cars-lifespan-study-095041081.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">583f4d57-9713-41b3-9e06-9f1464c98102</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:25:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626860926</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T09:49:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pollution & Waste]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4b39fe40-ea05-11eb-bfdd-9d7e1cad4897" width="7400" height="4933" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4b39fe40-ea05-11eb-bfdd-9d7e1cad4897" width="7400" height="4933" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JENS SCHLUETER via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Employees work on the assembly line for the Volkswagen (VW) ID 3 electric car of German carmaker Volkswagen, at the 'Glassy Manufactory' (Glaeserne Manufaktur) production site in Dresden, eastern Germany on June 8, 2021.

One of the most useful changes to Maps is the expansion of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-google-maps-public-transit-crowdedness-predictions-delays.html">transit crowdedness predictions</a> to over 10,000 cities in 100 countries.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies are expecting their staff to get back to the office in the near future, and crowdedness prediction can let you know if the train or bus line you&#39;re waiting for has a lot of open seats, or if it&#39;s already crowded. That way, you can decide whether to hop on or wait for the next one in hopes that it isn&#39;t as jam-packed.  Maps can make predictions by combining AI tech with contributions from people using Google Maps, along with historical location trends.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/de222960-ea0c-11eb-975f-6e028f97245a" style="height:897;width:1200;" alt="Google Maps" data-uuid="9fbfc329-04e6-3f2e-9303-596db5bbcac9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>If you&#39;re in New York and Sydney, you can even see a train&#39;s level of crowdedness down to transit car level in real time. Maps will mark the least crowded cars, so you can line up for one of them, thanks to data from transport agencies in the areas. It&#39;s still a pilot at the moment, but Google says the feature will be available in more cities soon.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the tech giant has launched a new Timeline Insights tab for the Maps app. So long as you&#39;re on Android and you have Location History switched on, you&#39;ll be able to view &quot;monthly trends about how you’re navigating the world.&quot; For instance, that&#39;s where you can see how much time you spend at different places, such as shops or airports, and the distance and time for each mode of transportation you&#39;ve taken. The tech giant says it developed the feature after users told the company that they want &quot;to be more intentional about how they spend their time&quot; after living through the pandemic.</p><p>Finally, Trips in the Timeline tab is now available to everyone on Android, so you can relive the vacations you&#39;ve had in the past. In case your favorite travel destination still isn&#39;t welcoming tourists, you can go to the section and virtually visit hotels, restaurants and other places you&#39;ve previously enjoyed.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-features-post-lockdown-life-100004041.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97dd6b88-ba3f-4e2c-b617-0ff883a58244</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626862681</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T10:18:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/7c707a70-6914-11ea-bbc2-8ad1adea04d7" width="5311" height="3541" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-03/7c707a70-6914-11ea-bbc2-8ad1adea04d7" width="5311" height="3541" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Halfpoint Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman commuter using public transport in summer.

The hardware HW 3.0 update will now cost $1,000 rather than $1,500, a 33 percent drop in price. To get the feature, owners will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-price-availability-151630041.html">have to pay</a> a monthly subscription fee of up to $199 on top of that, or $10,000 all in one shot.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware">famously said</a> in 2016 that all its EVs produced going forward would have full self-driving hardware. However, it eventually found that a computer update would be needed on older vehicles and started shipping later models with the new HW 3.0 hardware. However, owners of Tesla models produced between late 2016 and mid-2019 were shocked to get hit with a $1,500 hardware upgrade bill on top of the cost of the FSD upgrade.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After telling customers they&#39;d be charged $1,500 for the hardware update, Tesla appears to have lowered that to $1,000.

Rather, it told California regulators that it conforms to SAE Level 2, much like models from Cadillac, Audi and others. Tesla CEO Elon Musk himself said that &quot;there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid.&quot;  <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-software-lacks-safeguards-a6698414036/"><em>Consumer Reports</em></a>, meanwhile, noted that it&#39;s &quot;concerned that Tesla is still using its existing owners and their vehicles to beta-test new features on public roads.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-reduces-the-price-of-its-full-self-driving-computer-upgrade-by-500-091157676.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc299a10-59da-4621-ac1f-bd23b674272c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:11:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626858719</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T09:12:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f3f33d0-e9fa-11eb-bff7-1a51b889584d" width="1400" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f3f33d0-e9fa-11eb-bff7-1a51b889584d" width="1400" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla reduces the price of its 'Full Self-Driving' computer upgrade by $500]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla reduces the price of its 'Full Self-Driving' computer upgrade by $500]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tokyo Olympics staff will be given ear-worn devices to reduce the risk of heatstroke]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Summers in Tokyo are not only hot, they&#39;re also extremely humid — together, those two elements are a recipe for heat-related illness.

The company adds that Adobe Sensei features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-13-adobe-premiere-pro-reframes-video.html">Auto Reframe</a> feel “noticeably” faster and that the app uses significantly less battery power on M1 Macs.</p><p>While Apple has only offered computers with its own ARM-based chips since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">November of last year</a>, Adobe has been quick to support the platform. In December, it came out with an Apple Silicon version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-lightroom-arm-m1-macs-windows-140044076.html">Lightroom</a> and followed that up in March with a native release of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-releases-a-faster-native-photoshop-app-for-apples-m-1-macs-140031036.html">Photoshop</a>. With today’s announcement, you don’t need to turn to Rosetta 2 to emulate most of the company’s most popular apps.

The tool allows third-party developers to offer pared-down versions of their apps within Snapchat. So far, some of the more popular developers to offer Minis include Headspace, but HBO Max is the first major streamer to use the feature to let people view its content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can start the HBO Max Mini by tapping on the rocket icon in chat or using the search feature to find it. Before you can see a list of available episodes, the app will ask you to verify your age. You don&#39;t need an HBO Max subscription to watch any of the pilots, but the Mini will prompt users over the age of 18 to sign up for the service. Once a session is underway, up to 63 other people can join one, and you can chat with everyone else watching the episode and share Bitmoji reactions.</p><p>HBO Max isn&#39;t the first streaming service to use another platform to attract users.

Starting this week, however, YouTube is taking a step toward making that functionality something that’s built into the platform. While it’s still in beta, the company says its new “Super Thanks” feature is <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-newest-member-supers-family-super-thanks/">rolling out to “thousands” of additional creators in 68 countries</a>. By the end of the year, it plans to make it available to everyone in the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p>When you decide to give your favorite creator a Super Thanks, you’ll have four options before you. The amounts will vary by market, but in the US you can donate $2, $5, $10 or $50 at one time. Once you complete the payment process, you’ll see an animated GIF of balloons float across your screen, and YouTube will highlight your comment, as well as the amount of money you sent. As with the other monetization tools YouTube offers to streamers, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-12-youtube-super-chat-comments-are-a-new-way-to-support-livestrea.html"><ins>Super Chat</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-youtube-animated-stickers-streamers-twitch-mixer.html"><ins>Super Stickers</ins></a>, the company will take a 30 percent cut of all donations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Adding more ways for creators to earn money is important for YouTube, even if it’s one the company is late to offer.

In <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx">its Q2 2021 earnings report</a>, the company confirmed some things. First, Netflix says it &quot;will be primarily focused&quot; on mobile at first, looking to expand on its interactivity projects like <em>Black Mirror Bandersnatch </em>and its Stranger Things games. The upcoming titles will be available at no additional cost as part of your subscription and the company was clear it will keep up the pace on movies and television.</p><p>&quot;We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,&quot; the company said in a letter to its shareholders.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>2020 was a big year for Netflix. With everyone stuck at home and movie theaters closed, the streaming service attracted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html">16 million new customers in three months</a>. As expected, in 2021 that pace has dramatically slowed and the new customer numbers continue to be a struggle. In its earnings report, the company says it added 1.5 million subscribers in Q2, which was actually a bit better than its forecast mark of one million. However, that&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2021-201731732.html">lower than Q1 2021</a>, which saw the company tack on 3.98 million new customers globally.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix says it forecasts new customer additions to hit 3.5 million in Q3 2021, up from 2.2 million during the same three-month a year ago. If it does so, the company explains that would bring the total new subscriber tally to 54 million over the last two years. The pace may have slowed for Netflix, but overall it&#39;s doing just fine. Revenue was still up 19 percent year-over-year at $7.3 billion for the quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Netflix&#39;s own numbers, <em>Shadow and Bone </em>was a popular series this quarter, streaming to over 55 million &quot;member households&quot; in less than a month. The show has already been renewed for a second season based on those numbers. <em>Sweet Tooth, </em>a series based on a DC comic, was streamed by 60 million households the first month it was available. Unscripted series like <em>Too Hot to Handle </em>and <em>The Circle </em>were popular selections as well, as was true crime docuseries <em>The Sons of Sam. </em>In terms of movies, Zac Snyder&#39;s <em>Army of the Dead </em>hit 75 million households in the first month. Netflix also explained that <em>The Mitchells vs. The Machines </em>is now its biggest animated film to date, streaming to 53 million households.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix says COVID-related production delays led to a &quot;lighter&quot; first half of 2021 in terms of content, but the pace will pick up throughout the rest of the year. The company&#39;s Q3 lineup includes new seasons of <em>La Casa de Papel</em> (<em>Money Heist</em>), <em>Sex Education</em>, <em>Virgin River</em> and <em>Never Have I Ever</em> in addition to live action films like <em>Sweet Girl</em> (Jason Momoa), <em>Kissing Booth 3 </em>and <em>Kate</em> (Mary Elizabeth Winstead).

He wasn&#39;t the only person aboard the rocket, which was the first-ever crewed flight from private space company Blue Origin, but he&#39;s the one that camera crews flocked to once the 10-minute trip was done. Maybe they were drawn in by his smile. Maybe they thought he was the winner of a sub-orbital Lex Luthor lookalike contest. Maybe his bulbous, pale cowboy hat caught their eye.&nbsp;</p><p>In reality of course, it was because Bezos is the founder of Blue Origin and Amazon, and considered to be the richest person in the world. This wealth not only gives him the opportunity to build, run and then ride his own rocket ships, but it also makes people really interested in what he has to say, regardless of his relationship to the matter at hand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When Bezos stepped back onto Earth after spinning around in zero-gravity for a few minutes, the cameras descended and his cowboy hat answered a handful of questions about the experience. The world&#39;s richest man shared his thoughts about space, pollution and wage depression, likely just before taking an SUV caravan to his private jet and heading to one of his global luxury estates.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are three of the most centibillionaire things Bezos said <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/jeff-bezos-says-spaceflight-reinforced-commitment-solving-climate-chan-rcna1467">after his Blue Origin flight</a> today:</p><p><strong>“We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry, and move it into space. And keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is.”</strong> In this same interview, Bezos discussed his plans to expand Blue Origin&#39;s space tourism business over the coming decades, a venture that has the potential to pump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/19/billionaires-space-tourism-environment-emissions">massive amounts of carbon and other chemicals</a> into the atmosphere. Unlike ground-based emitters like cars or coal-powered plants, rocket emissions are expelled directly into the upper atmosphere, where they linger for years. Additionally, Amazon has threatened <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-amazon-employees-protest-climate-communications-policies.html">to fire employees</a> for speaking up about the company&#39;s support of the oil and gas industries.</p><p><strong>&quot;We need unifiers, not vilifiers. When you look out at the planet, there are no borders. There&#39;s nothing. It&#39;s one planet and we share it and it&#39;s fragile.&quot;</strong> As the CEO of Amazon, for years Bezos fought against company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-vote-154741754.html">efforts to unionize</a>, even amid credible reports of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-200-million-prime-subscribers-165713430.html">inhumane, exploitative conditions</a> for Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers.&nbsp;</p><div id="8fdead6a8e424ddaa7586aadb74bb974"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JeffBezos</a> speaking truth after successful <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlueOrigin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlueOrigin</a> flight: <br><br>“I also want to thank every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer because you guys paid for all of this.” <a href="https://t.co/hMS01eRzMs">https://t.co/hMS01eRzMs</a><a href="https://t.co/3CueAOX9M8">pic.twitter.com/3CueAOX9M8</a></p>— Dan Linden (@DanLinden) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanLinden/status/1417513266050445312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Bezos, who amassed more than $70 billion in personal wealth last year and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">regularly pays $0 in federal income taxes</a>, then thanked those same Amazon employees for paying for his trip to space.

A major expansion is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xiv-online-endwalker-november-23rd-214301453.html"><ins>scheduled to arrive in November</ins></a>, and players may be returning or picking the game up ahead of <em>Endwalker</em>&#39;s arrival.</p><p>However, the game&#39;s servers are struggling to handle the influx of players. Producer and director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/c2d7b35d55577879086b64cfde0acb6c23ccd07f"><ins>wrote that</ins></a> many players in North America and Europe have had trouble logging in or creating characters recently because of &quot;server congestion.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some North American servers were at maximum capacity for up to seven hours at some points last weekend, and the average queue times were around 10-20 minutes. On the European servers, players had to wait for up to 40 minutes.</p><p>Square Enix has revealed some measures to tackle <em>Final Fantasy XIV Online</em>&#39;s server issues. It has accelerated plans to boot out players who stay idle for too long. That feature is typically enabled when a new expansion arrives to help the systems cope with a surge in player numbers, as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22585359/final-fantasy-14-streamer-popularity-afk-timer-developer-statement"><em><ins>Polygon</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes, but Square Enix is bringing it back early. Yoshida also asked players to log out and free up spots if they&#39;re inactive.</p><p>The publisher says the game&#39;s North American data centers were recently upgraded. As of this week, the game supports up to 18,000 simultaneous logins in that region — up to 750 players per world server. The European data centers are in line for a similar upgrade soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yoshida noted the global semiconductor shortage has slowed delivery of servers to some data centers. Travel restrictions related to COVID-19 have prevented the server infrastructure team from visiting data centers too.</p><p>It&#39;s fascinating to see a game that&#39;s been around for eight years have such a massive, sudden increase in popularity, four months out from the next expansion. Still, it once again highlights the impact that streamers have on gaming culture.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-final-fantasy-xiv-servers-plan-193317600.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b7111623-d43e-40ff-b1b6-fa5cb106a36e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 19:33:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626809860</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T19:37:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/5b373080-9cfb-11eb-bf78-3fd9ae35c8c0" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/5b373080-9cfb-11eb-bf78-3fd9ae35c8c0" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dropbox makes automatic camera uploads available to all free users]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dropbox is introducing a variety of <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/new-features-to-keep-you-organized-at-work-and-home"><ins>new features across its product stack</ins></a>.

Elsewhere, Dropbox says a redesigned details pane makes it easier to see important information about your files.

Chrome will also soon allow you to type &quot;manage security settings&quot; and &quot;manage sync&quot; to access the relevant controls mentioned in those commands.</p><p>Rounding things off, Google has updated Chrome&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-12-google-chrome-67-site-isolation.html">Site Isolation feature</a> to cover a broader range of websites and extensions. Phishing protection is also improved, with Google claiming it&#39;s 50 times faster and uses less battery life. As mention above, you won&#39;t have to wait long to try out these latest features, with Google promising to roll them out in the coming weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-chrome-permissions-actions-170022231.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">58bc1bbd-ed0e-4bf8-a882-ce9742f0cc92</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 17:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626800426</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T17:00:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9c89ae10-e97b-11eb-9dfa-78ebf25f2c40" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9c89ae10-e97b-11eb-9dfa-78ebf25f2c40" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Igor Bonifacic / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Chrome]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Chrome]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram offers users more control over 'sensitive content' in the Explore tab]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/instagram"><ins>Instagram&#39;s</ins></a> Explore tab can feel like the Wild West at times.

Following similar announcements from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-google-messages-212527575.html">T-Mobile</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-google-messages-rcs-default-174512924.html">AT&amp;T</a> earlier in the year, Verizon (Engadget&#39;s parent company) <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-google-messaging-services-android">said today</a> it&#39;s working with Google to bring the next-generation SMS replacement to all of its customers.</p><p>By the end of the year, existing Verizon subscribers who use the carrier&#39;s Message+ app will get full access to the RCS suite, including real-time typing indicators and read receipts. Then, starting next year, all of the company&#39;s phones will come with the <a href="https://messages.google.com/">Messages by Google</a> app preinstalled. Once that happens, RCS perks like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-messages-global-rcs-end-to-end-encryption-161130685.html">end-to-end encryption</a> for one-on-one conversations and the ability to send full-resolution photos will be an app away.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To say today&#39;s announcement is a significant milestone for Google would be an understatement. The company has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-19-google-chat-rcs-sms-messages-android.html">pushing RCS for years</a>, and at times it seemed like the project was fated to languish like so many of Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-12-google-allo-messenger-goodbye.html">past mobile messaging efforts</a>. Due to the need for carrier buy-in, the protocol didn&#39;t &quot;just work&quot; like iMessage, at least not initially.&nbsp;</p><p>In the early years, even if you went out of your way to download Google Messages, there was no guarantee you would get any of its promised benefits. That&#39;s because, more often than not, it was likely the person you were texting didn&#39;t have an RCS-capable app installed on their phone, nor were they with a carrier that was onboard with the platform. That meant most Android chats defaulted to SMS. With Google Messages now the default on most new Android phones in the US, that&#39;s a situation that should be the exception, not the norm. Today&#39;s announcement also leaves Apple in an odd position. Once an innovator in the space, the company is now on the outside looking in at a more broadly adopted ecosystem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-verizon-rcs-partnership-161912204.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb3062d5-9639-4d64-9d55-1442de08e704</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 16:19:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626797607</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T16:13:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2a3b4e60-e974-11eb-a6ff-944d16bfad7e" width="3000" height="1604" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2a3b4e60-e974-11eb-a6ff-944d16bfad7e" width="3000" height="1604" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['District 9' director Neill Blomkamp is helping make a new 'AAA' game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>District 9 </em>director Neill Blomkamp never did get to make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-04-10-neill-blomkamp-would-still-like-to-do-that-halo-movie-actually.html"><ins>his </ins><em><ins>Halo </ins></em><ins>movie</ins></a>.

Email Protection is now available in beta. It’s a free forwarding service that strips tracking pixels from your emails with the aim of shielding your personal data.</p><p>Around 70 percent of emails contain trackers, DuckDuckGo notes. These can be used to tell the sender when you opened an email, the device you accessed it with and even where you are when you read it. The company notes that trackers can be used for ad targeting as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To use the Email Protection service, you’ll need to sign up for a nifty, free @duck.com email address. DuckDuckGo will extract any trackers from emails sent to that address and forward the messages to your regular inbox. The company says its systems will <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/email/privacy-guarantees">never save emails</a> — not even the sender or recipient&#39;s email address. When you get the email, you&#39;ll be able to see which trackers, if any, DuckDuckGo yanked.</p><p>You can also generate randomized addresses to stop companies from tracking you by email. This part of the service is similar to Apple’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-siri-on-device-app-privacy-181525551.html">Hide My Email</a> option. DuckDuckGo’s approach works across platforms though its app and browser extension.</p><p>If you think a site or app might pummel you with spam or share your email address elsewhere, you can create a disposable address. This could come in handy when you&#39;re signing up for a free trial, for instance. It will also provide a level of protection if that email address is leaked in a data breach. No one would know what email address you use for other services.

Since this is the first time many of you will be away from home, it’s a good idea to stock up on a few items for your new tiny abode. Not all of our recommendations will be strictly tech-related here because, while tech is important in college (of course), we also wanted to cover the other  essentials that will bring you the comforts of home to your dorm and hopefully make student life less stressful.</p><p>Examples include kitchen items like an adjustable-temp electric kettle, a weighted blanket for reducing anxiety, and a mattress topper that will make that dorm bed much more comfortable. At the same time, you might not want to be in your room forever, which is why we’ve also recommended a few items that could improve your social life, such as a portable Bluetooth speaker for parties and a couple of casual board games. Whether you just want to chill out or make a few friends, we hope this list will help you settle into dorm life.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Linenspa foam pillow</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d56203-df46-11eb-bdef-485d039d449f"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Comfort is key to dorm living, which is why we recommend an oversized reading pillow like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:this one from Linenspa" href="https://amzn.to/2VgBPUq">this one from Linenspa</a>. It helps change up your seating position so you’re not in your desk chair all the time, plus it’s a lot more comfortable than just piling up bed pillows against the wall. The pillow is filled with shredded memory foam so it won’t put a lot of stress on your back, plus it comes with a soft velour cover. That posture support makes it great for reading, playing games or watching TV. As a bonus, there’s also a handle on the top that makes it easy to carry around.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy LinenSpa pillow at Amazon - $40" href="https://amzn.to/2VgBPUq">Buy LinenSpa pillow at Amazon - $40</a></p><h2>Mind Reader lap desk</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d56202-df46-11eb-9f5d-f9c8c39b9a41"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you frequently use your laptop not just for work but also for watching videos and general entertainment, consider getting a portable desk that you can place on your lap. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:This one from Mind Reader" href="https://amzn.to/3ACQwRS">This one from Mind Reader</a> is excellent thanks to its dual-bolster pillow support. All told, it has eight different angle options that you can adjust to your liking. Additionally, you can use it to prop up a book or tablet for easy reading. When you’re done working, it also works well as a tray table for snacks while watching TV.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy lap desk at Amazon - $15" href="https://amzn.to/3ACQwRS">Buy lap desk at Amazon - $15</a></p><h2>Aeropress</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4cf6e92-df46-11eb-bb7b-14073d39c068" alt="Aeropress for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="5ccb66eb-c75d-3ad4-b78c-02a11b8d9443"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Having a reliable way to make coffee every morning is practically a must-have for a lot of college students, especially for those dreaded 8am classes. One of the cheapest and fastest ways to get an excellent brew is to use the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Aeropress" href="https://amzn.to/2Uz4dAU">Aeropress</a>, which has been a favorite among caffeine addicts for years. It can make a strong, full-bodied cup in just a few minutes, and its plunger-driven design is so simple that even a coffee beginner can use it. It’s small and compact enough for travel and it doesn’t require any electricity, which makes it ideal for camping trips. On top of that, there’s minimal cleaning involved. Equally important, it’s quite affordable at around $30.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Aeropress at Amazon - $32" href="https://amzn.to/2Uz4dAU">Buy Aeropress at Amazon - $32</a></p><h2>Black+Decker Dustbuster Pivot Vac</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4cf6e91-df46-11eb-9a56-67435f107a15"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>One of the first lessons you’ll likely learn as a college student is that you’ll have no one to clean up after you. That means doing your own laundry and yes, cleaning your own room. The easiest way to do so is with a handheld vacuum, like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Black+Decker 20V Max" href="https://amzn.to/3ACJtbT">Black+Decker 20V Max</a>. It only weighs three pounds so it’s lightweight enough for you to clean your whole room without a lot of fuss. It has a pivoting nozzle which makes it ideal for getting around tight corners and hard-to-reach shelves. Its high-performance motor provides plenty of suction and its 15-ounce capacity is large enough for most dorm rooms. The bowl and filter are removable so you can give them a good wash in between uses. It’s also overall easy to use and fairly affordable, two things you can’t often say about fancy, expensive vacuums.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Black + Decker handheld vacuum at Amazon - $90" href="https://amzn.to/3ACJtbT">Buy Black + Decker handheld vacuum at Amazon - $90</a></p><h2><strong>Anyday Medium Deep Dish</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4cf6e90-df46-11eb-bedb-0a4b4cfe01bc" alt="Anyday Medium Deep Dish for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="03230302-0c20-3bc8-bcff-9bd82e3a03af"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>You’re probably not allowed to have an Instant Pot in your dorm room, but one kitchen appliance that almost always gets the thumbs up is a microwave. Sure, you can use it to heat up frozen dinners, but why not try it to cook actual dishes as well? <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Anyday&#x002019;s line of microwave cookware" href="https://fave.co/3wnvQdo">Anyday’s line of microwave cookware</a> lets you do exactly that. Everything is microwave safe, including the stainless steel rim (its smooth and curved shape prevents electrical arcing). Its primary feature is its lid, which has a knob that can vent excess steam when it is lifted. Thanks to this innovation, you can make everything from mac and cheese to a breakfast burrito using only your microwave. For college students, we recommend the medium dish set — they’re sized just right for solo diners.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Medium cookware set at Anyday - $55" href="https://fave.co/3wnvQdo">Buy Medium cookware set at Anyday - $55</a></p><h2>Bearaby Cotton Napper</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d031e0-df46-11eb-97de-a85a909dd10f" alt="Bearaby Cotton Napper for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="31151283-a735-3388-b362-ed94a5f72e43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bearaby</div></figure><p>If you’re like most college students, you’ll probably have your fair share of stress throughout the semester, which can make it harder to get enough sleep. One way to help overcome it is with a weighted blanket, which helps reduce anxiety. Our favorite is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Bearaby cotton napper" href="https://fave.co/3k5P2dd">Bearaby cotton napper</a>. Unlike other weighted blankets that are filled with tiny glass beads, it’s handmade with a heavy chunky-knit material that feels like a warm hug when wrapped around you. Another bonus is just how gorgeous they look: They come in a variety of luscious colors — from Midnight Blue to Butternut Bliss — and their knit design makes them far more stylish than most weighted blankets on the market. They’ll go well in any decor and are sure to garner plenty of likes on Instagram.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Cotton Napper at Bearaby - $250" href="https://fave.co/3k5P2dd">Buy Cotton Napper at Bearaby - $250</a></p><h2>Lenovo Smart Clock Essential</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d4ecd0-df46-11eb-aa79-6dac8cc0ac61" alt="Lenovo Smart Clock Essential for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="50018997-cb93-3b29-97d2-52133160a42a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Even though you could use your phone as an alarm clock, it’s still useful to have a dedicated device for the task. It lets you keep your phone away from your bedside for a more restful sleep, plus you can tell time just by glancing at it. One of our favorites is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Lenovo&#x002019;s Smart Clock Essential" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/yRyZWv">Lenovo’s Smart Clock Essential</a>, which has Google Assistant built in. There are other smart alarm clocks out there — like Amazon’s Echo Show 5, for example — but it retails for close to $85. The Smart Clock Essential, on the other hand, is very affordable at only $50. Sure, it isn’t nearly as advanced as the Echo Show 5, but if all you want are the alarm clock features, then the Essential should more than suffice. The clock’s 4-inch LED screen shows time in bold digits, and you can ask the Assistant to play music, set timers or create reminders. The integrated nightlight is also a nice touch for those who don’t like to sleep in complete darkness.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Smart Clock Essential at Best Buy - $50" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/yRyZWv">Buy Smart Clock Essential at Best Buy - $50</a></p><h2>Lunya Organic Pima sleep mask</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d56201-df46-11eb-bb54-60d47704d019" alt="Lunya Organic Prima sleep mask for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="6a12fa34-c1d0-38ff-b202-ce383e01d915"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Roommate pulling an all-nighter with the lights on? Want to catch some z’s in the afternoon in between classes? Or maybe you’re just particularly sensitive to light? If you can relate to any of this, we recommend getting a sleep mask to make it easier for you to drift off into dreamland. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:This one from Lunya" href="https://fave.co/3yv46ou">This one from Lunya</a> is one of our personal favorites because it completely blocks out light and feels comfortable to boot; it’s like wearing pillows on your eyes. We tend to prefer this model over masks with eye cups because it’s not quite as bulky. The Lunya’s wide elasticized band will fit most people and it even covers the ears, which helps reduce noise. It’s also machine washable, so you can easily keep it clean.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy sleep mask at Lunya - $48" href="https://fave.co/3yv46ou">Buy sleep mask at Lunya - $48</a></p><h2>OXO pour-over kettle</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d5b020-df46-11eb-81ff-801b3c3f78a7" alt="OXO Pour-over kettle for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="e4e1cc2a-6344-3f94-9fc3-4d9b09a5cfaf"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Most dorms don’t allow appliances with an open heating element, which is why there are no toasters or hot plates on this list. But thankfully for tea and coffee aficionados, many do permit electric kettles. One of our favorite models is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:OXO Brew Adjustable Temperature Pour-Over Kettle" href="https://amzn.to/3dSmz6s">OXO Brew Adjustable Temperature Pour-Over Kettle</a>. You can adjust the temperature in one-degree increments from 140 to 212 Fahrenheit, which is perfect for those who like to dial in the right temp for a specific brew — most green tea, for example, brews between 160 and 170 Fahrenheit, while you generally want boiling water for black tea. This specific model is especially useful for those who like pour-over coffee due to its gooseneck spout. There’s also a built-in timer to keep track of your brewing process. Of course, you can use boiling water to heat up other concoctions too, like hot cocoa mix or cup noodles.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy OXO kettle at Amazon - $100" href="https://amzn.to/3dSmz6s">Buy OXO kettle at Amazon - $100</a></p><h2>Pure Green latex mattress topper</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d64c61-df46-11eb-9f5f-1b59b2d44bb8" alt="Pure Green Latex mattress topper for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="b103a48f-db92-3351-aaa4-e5eb838586ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pure Green</div></figure><p>Chances are, the bed in your dorm room isn’t very comfortable. It’s also probably not easy (or cost effective) to change the mattress. That’s why we recommend getting a mattress topper because it’s the one way to control how your bed feels without spending a lot of money. We prefer a natural latex option like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:this one from Pure Green" href="https://amzn.to/3yv3TSe">this one from Pure Green</a> because it delivers comfort and support without the sinking feeling of memory foam. It also won’t absorb much body heat, which helps keep you cool throughout the night. Pure Green sells its mattress topper in three different thicknesses — from 1-inch to 3-inch — to fit your particular needs. Opt for the 1 or 2-inch if you want firm or medium-firm, or spring for the 3-inch model if you prefer things soft.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy mattress topper at Amazon - $110" href="https://amzn.to/3yv3TSe">Buy mattress topper at Amazon - $110</a></p><h2>Rubbermaid food storage containers</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4cfe3c0-df46-11eb-bf1f-f707b2ecf579" alt="Rubbermaid food storage for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="bc0eab77-f5b7-3886-8582-9d73a2ed5b51"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rubbermaid </div></figure><p>When you’re in college, you’ll no longer have quick access to your family’s pantry, which you could easily raid for late-night munchies.

The lids snap tight to keep food fresh and they stack on top of each other in order to save space. They’re durable enough to withstand everyday use, whether you use them for crackers, pretzels or cereal. You could also use these containers to grab a hot dinner from the dining hall on your way to a group study session.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Rubbermaid Brilliance container at Amazon - $17" href="https://amzn.to/3xklfky">Buy Rubbermaid Brilliance container at Amazon - $17</a></p><h2>Ultimate Ears Boom 3</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d64c60-df46-11eb-bebf-08880c24587a" alt="Ultimate Ears Boom 3 for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="b0b3c1b6-6413-3eae-ba83-56ea5659ceec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>College life isn’t all work and stress — sometimes you’ll want to have parties and blast your favorite tunes.

Your smartphone just won’t have the same level of volume or audio quality as a dedicated speaker, and your laptop’s speakers likely aren’t to task either (not to mention you probably want to put your laptop away if you’re at a party). The Boom 3 has an attractive cylindrical design, a rechargeable battery that lasts 15 hours on a charge, and it delivers punchy, immersive sound that will easily fill the room. It’s also IP67-rated to be waterproof, which makes it ideal for hanging out by the pool or a trip to the beach.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy UE Boom 3 at Amazon - $150" href="https://amzn.to/3hNiwJI">Buy UE Boom 3 at Amazon - $150</a></p><h2>Codenames</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d031e1-df46-11eb-9ea7-bc9600079cbc"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Playing casual board games is a great way to socialize at gatherings without the need to engage in small talk. A really popular one is called <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Codenames" href="https://amzn.to/3dUsHv3">Codenames</a>, a party game that pits two teams of spies against each other. Each “spymaster” has to get their teammates to guess hidden words (which are plotted out on a grid) using only one-word clues and a number. For example, if you wanted your team to guess the words “costume,” “web,” and “spider,” you might say “Peter, 3” to indicate that there are three clues on the board that match that word. There are also clues you have to avoid, which makes the game a little harder. The game is easy to explain, plus it encourages communication, which helps break the ice.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Codenames at Amazon - $20" href="https://amzn.to/3dUsHv3">Buy Codenames at Amazon - $20</a></p><h2>Monikers</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d56200-df46-11eb-bf71-f12cbe86cc1c"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>For larger groups (up to 20 people in this case) who want to have a bit of silly fun, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Monikers" href="https://amzn.to/2UwzgNG">Monikers</a> is a fantastic party game. Players take turns giving clues to teammates so that they’ll guess what’s on the card, which can be anything from a famous musician (eg. Rick Astley) to a viral meme (e.g., LOLCats). For the first round, they can use as many words as they want to describe the clue. But in the second round, they can only use one. In the third, they can’t use any words at all, which is basically charades. Almost every game of Monikers will result in giggles, laughter and hopefully a memorable evening.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Monikers at Amazon - $30" href="https://amzn.to/2UwzgNG">Buy Monikers at Amazon - $30</a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-college-dorm-room-essentials-143052706.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3f3cb6df-16f9-42a1-8c86-5e0d13343d58</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 14:30:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626448194</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T15:10:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Home & Garden]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d2c9f0-df46-11eb-bae6-0a62678cf7a8" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4d2c9f0-df46-11eb-bae6-0a62678cf7a8" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Will Lipman Photography for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A collection of Dorm Essentials for Engadget's 2021 Back to School guide.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dorm Essentials (lead)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's latest flagship soundbar offers Dolby Atmos and 360 Reality Audio]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At CES 2020, Sony demoed its 360 Reality Audio (360RA) technology <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-sony-360-reality-audio-ces-2020.html">on a home theater setup</a> like you would put in your living room. The in-booth layout included a soundbar, subwoofer and two rear satellite speakers. Today, the company announced the first gear that will allow you to actually create something similar at home. The company&#39;s new <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/hta7000">HT-A7000 flagship soundbar</a> offers Dolby Atmos in addition to 360RA and the option to tack on sub and/or extra speakers can accommodate any space. If you&#39;re not so much into soundbars but still want the sensation of immersive audio, Sony also introduced <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/hta9">the HT-A9</a>: a set of four speakers and a control box equipped with new 360 Spatial Sound Mapping tech.&nbsp;</p><p>The HT-A7000 is a 7.1.2-channel soundbar packed with Sony&#39;s X-balanced speakers, side beam tweeters, up-firing drivers for Dolby Atmos and dual subwoofers. Thanks to a Virtual Surround Engine (overhead) and S-Force Pro Front Surround (horizontal), the A7000 can simulate immersive audio on its own so you can take advantage of DTS:X in addition to Atmos. The soundbar is equipped with Sound Field Optimization that uses built-in microphones to calibrate the speaker to a room by detecting the height and width of the space as well as the position of a wireless subwoofer and any rear speakers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="72f06060-abb4-4ccc-babc-6f7049155e08"/><p>When it comes to music, the A7000 accommodates High-Resolution Audio and 360 Reality Audio. In fact, this is the first Sony soundbar to support 360RA and just the third speaker from the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-360-reality-audio-ces-2021-130027671.html">to do so</a>. The A7000 also has Sony&#39;s DSEE Extreme technology that Sony has leveraged for its headphones. That feature restores some of the compression from streaming services in real time, giving you something akin to lossless audio without the massive file sizes or the need for a wired setup.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of connectivity, the A7000 has HDMI 2.1 with eARC and both 8K and 4K/120fps passthrough — plus Dolby Vision support. The soundbar works with Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect, so you have options when it comes to streaming music from your phone or another device. When used with compatible Bravia TVs, the A7000 works with Sony&#39;s Acoustic Center Sync that allows you to employ your television&#39;s speakers as additional center audio for things like speech clarity. The new soundbar can be controlled by a Google Assistant device at launch and Sony plans to add Alexa compatibility in a future update. Lastly, the company says optional wireless subwoofers and rear speakers will connect automatically to the A7000 when you power them on.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-07-sonys-flagship-soundbar-kicks-out-room-filling-audio.html">the HT-ST5000</a> that it&#39;s replacing, the HT-A7000 soundbar doesn&#39;t come with a subwoofer. Sony says it unbundled the pairing based on customer feedback. Some people wanted the company&#39;s top-of-the-line soundbar, but they weren&#39;t necessarily interested in the sub. It&#39;s a beast in terms of both size and sound, so it&#39;s not ideal for apartments on any room where space is limited. Instead, Sony is offering two subwoofer options — <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/sasw5">the SA-SW5</a> and <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/sasw3">SA-SW3</a> — along with <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/tv-video-home-theater-sound-bars/all-home-theater-sound-bars/p/sars3s">a pair of rear satellite speakers (SA-RS3S)</a> as separate purchases. All of the add-ons connect to the HT-A7000 wirelessly, with the SW5 offering 300 watts of low-end tone via a 7-inch driver and the SW3 packing 200 watts of bass with a 6-inch speaker.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="593796ae-7a85-46f9-bc14-e17b759a666e"/><p>With the A9 &quot;home theater system,&quot; four cylindrical speakers offer what Sony describes as a &quot;flexible layout&quot; option that&#39;s meant to blend in with your living room decor. Thanks to Sound Field Optimization and built-in mics, the A9 can calibrate itself to any space — just like the tech does for the A7000. A key difference here is that the A9 is also equipped with Sony&#39;s new 360 Spatial Sound Mapping Technology. This feature not only lets you place the four units as you see fit, but it also offers a broad soundstage the company says is more immersive than &quot;traditional&quot; soundbars. Sony explains that the A9 gives users the sensation that the audio is &quot;coming from beyond their walls&quot; by creating up to 12 &quot;phantom&quot; speakers with just the four units. Of course, this is something we&#39;ll have to put the test to double-check the claim.&nbsp;</p><p>Each speaker houses X-balanced front and up-firing speakers along with a tweeter and bass duct. The four devices connect wirelessly to a control box that has HDMI in/out (eARC output) with 8K and 4K/120 passthrough alongside Dolby Vision. The A9 is compatible with immersive formats like Dolby Atmos, DTS:X, 360 Reality Audio and High-Resolution Audio. It also works with Chromecast, AirPlay 2 and Spotify Connect and you can leverage voice control by pairing the set of speakers with a Google Assistant (at launch) or Alexa (via future update) device. If you need a boost in the center channel, you can use the A9 with compatible Bravia TVs and Sony&#39;s Acoustic Center Sync to employ the speakers from the display. Lastly, both of Sony&#39;s new subwoofers can be paired with the A9 speakers for fuller sound.</p><p>All of Sony&#39;s new home theater gear is set to arrive in &quot;September/October,&quot; according to the company. The HT-A7000 soundbar is $1,300 while the HT-A9 speaker set is $1,800. The SA-SW5 and SA-SW3 subwoofers are $700 and $400 respectively, while the SA-RS3S satellite speakers are $350. That means if you&#39;re expecting to grab a complete setup with the A7000, a soundbar and rear speakers, you&#39;ll need to hand over at least $2,050.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eb6bcbd5-02de-43de-b014-ee3965ee3c83</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 14:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626783534</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T12:19:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/16aba220-e904-11eb-8eef-dbf21f9eb5f7" width="1200" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/16aba220-e904-11eb-8eef-dbf21f9eb5f7" width="1200" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony HT-A7000 soundbar]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony HT-A7000 soundbar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku sale on Amazon knocks the Streambar down to $99]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;ve been fans of Roku streaming devices for a long time thanks to their power, versatility and support for most major streaming services. Those looking to make an old TV in their homes smarter, or upgrade an aging streaming gadget, can do so for less now that many Roku devices are on sale at Amazon. Of note is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Streambar for $99" href="https://amzn.to/3kD56Du">Roku Streambar for $99</a> — that&#39;s the best price we&#39;ve seen the compact soundbar that also has built-in 4K streaming capabilities. Also discounted are the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Express" href="https://amzn.to/3eyj0mk">Roku Express</a>, now $25, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Express 4K+" href="https://amzn.to/3wPeBBL">Roku Express 4K+</a>, now $29, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roku Streaming Stick+" href="https://amzn.to/3xRZRUd">Roku Streaming Stick+</a>, now $39.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Roku Streambar at Amazon - $99" href="https://amzn.to/3kD56Du">Buy Roku Streambar at Amazon - $99</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Roku Express at Amazon - $25" href="https://amzn.to/3eyj0mk">Buy Roku Express at Amazon - $25</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Roku Express 4K+ at Amazon - $29" href="https://amzn.to/3wPeBBL">Buy Roku Express 4K+ at Amazon - $29</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Roku Streaming Stick+ at Amazon - $39" href="https://amzn.to/3xRZRUd">Buy Roku Streaming Stick+ at Amazon - $39</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-review-133013675.html">Roku Streambar</a> is one of those multipurpose gadgets that succeeds at everything it&#39;s designed to do. It&#39;s a soundbar that&#39;s roughly the size of a carton of eggs, which should make it easy to fit into most TV setups. And despite its small size, it packs a punch when it comes to sound quality. The Streambar makes for a solid upgrade for anyone relying on built-in TV speakers, plus it supports Dolby Audio and works as a Bluetooth speaker as well.</p><p>While you could invest in the Streambar purely for its audio chops, it also has built-in Roku 4K streaming technology — that means it&#39;ll act as both your soundbar and set-top box. If you&#39;re not happy with your current smart TV or you have an old, &quot;dumb&quot; TV set that you don&#39;t want to replace just yet, the Roku Streambar is a good (and affordable) way to make it feel new again.</p><p>Those on tighter budgets may find something even better suited for their setup in Roku&#39;s other discounted devices. The Streaming Stick+ has been a favorite of ours for many years because it gives you 4K HDR streaming in a sleek, portable package. If you can compromise on things like long-range wireless connectivity and remote capabilities, the Express or the Express 4K+ are both inexpensive ways to add streaming features to your TV.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-99-deal-amazon-roku-streaming-devices-sale-134034742.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6a0454e3-eb5d-4470-8825-83747d7d1493</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 13:40:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626786719</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T13:12:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/9ef272e0-1794-11eb-bffd-21e2290ccd64" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/9ef272e0-1794-11eb-bffd-21e2290ccd64" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roku Streambar soundbar on a white table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roku Streambar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blue Origin completes its first crewed spaceflight with Bezos onboard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blue Origin just joined the ranks of private companies that have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html">taken people to space</a>. Jeff Bezos&#39; outfit has successfully <a href="https://twitter.com/blueorigin/status/1417475031597260802">completed</a> its first crewed spaceflight, taking Bezos, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-tourist-flight-123407896.html">his brother</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wally-funk-blue-origin-new-shepard-jeff-bezos-155036734.html">Wally Funk</a> and paying customer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-first-paying-customer-151137093.html">Oliver Daemen</a> beyond the Kárman line (62 miles above Earth) before their capsule returned to the desert.  The New Shepard rocket also touched down in what appeared to be a picture-perfect landing.</p><p>The flight broke multiple records. It included both the oldest-ever astronaut (Funk, 82 years old) and the youngest (Daemen, 18 years old). And while Virgin Galactic did enter space first by NASA&#39;s definition, Blue Origin was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html">more than a little keen</a> to point out that its flight was the only one of the two to cross the Kárman line.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>SpaceX was the first of these companies to take people to space through its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-crew-1-mission-splashdown-record-144301622.html">Crew-1 mission</a>, although it won&#39;t fly an all-civilian crew until <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-inspiration4-mission-full-crew-143428383.html">later this year</a>. Its space tourism plans so far focus on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-18-who-is-yusaku-maezawa-spacexs-first-lunar-tourist.html">trips around the Moon</a>, although those aren&#39;t expected to start until 2023.</p><p>The flight clearly involved a large share of bragging rights — it&#39;s yet another instance of a billionaire paying his way into space and marketing his space tourism business. It did represent an important transition for Blue Origin to commercial service after years of uncrewed test flights, though. More importantly, it showed that private human spaceflight is becoming increasingly common. Blue Origin, Virgin and SpaceX were just the vanguards. It&#39;s now just a question of how quickly the industry grows.</p><div id="9f2608b268f74f95b3cc0803abbe8e6a"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tMHhXzpwupU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">64a8a147-b3a9-47e3-b92c-0592ee8d542f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 13:29:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626812822</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T20:27:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3f6a880-e95d-11eb-afef-b43a9f3d264d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3f6a880-e95d-11eb-afef-b43a9f3d264d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Blue Origin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Blue Origin New Shepard capsule touchdown after first human spaceflight]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Blue Origin New Shepard capsule touchdown after first human spaceflight]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
