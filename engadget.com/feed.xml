Eighty percent of each platform&#39;s respective investment will go toward making French shows, TV movies and documentaries (more <em>Emily in Paris</em> and <em>Lupin</em>, anyone?). The remaining fifth — four or five percent of their total French revenue — will be used to make theatrically released movies.</p><p>The country is the first European Union member to enforce new streaming rules under the European Commission&#39;s <a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/avmsd"><ins>Audiovisual Media Services Directive</ins></a>. The framework is designed to create more parity between streaming platforms and other broadcasters and entertainment services across the EU.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Until now, streaming platforms have been prohibited from adding any theatrically released movie to their French libraries until three years after the film hit cinemas in the country. If the services spend a quarter of their French revenue on local content, they&#39;ll have access to films within 12 months of their release dates. If they opt for the minimum investment of 20 percent, they&#39;ll need to wait at least a year before adding theatrical releases.</p><p>So, there&#39;s an incentive for platforms to invest the full 25 percent of revenue. Disney+, for instance, might be tempted to go down that route so it can stream the likes of Marvel, Star Wars and Pixar movies much sooner in France.</p><p>Netflix is planning to reinvest 20 percent of its French revenue in local content, according to <a href="https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/avms-france-netflix-new-rules-streamers-1235008364/"><em>Variety</em></a>. It&#39;s hoping to lock down a 12-month window for theatrical movies. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-11-netflix-will-not-go-to-cannes-after-all.html"><ins>hasn&#39;t shown its movies</ins></a> at the Cannes Film Festival for years, partly because of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-10-manufactured-controversy-puts-netflix-s-future-at-cannes-in-doub.html"><ins>three-year cinema rule</ins></a>.</p><p>The EU has been working for years to ensure streaming platforms have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-04-netflix-amazon-european-content-quota-eu-law.html"><ins>a significant proportion of local content</ins></a> in their libraries. Other jurisdictions have been attempting to make streaming services invest in local productions as well.</p><p>The Canadian government, for instance, is looking to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/modernization-broadcasting-act/faq.html"><ins>reclassify streaming companies</ins></a>, which <a href="https://www.citynews1130.com/2020/11/03/canadian-content-streaming-bill/"><ins>could require them</ins></a> to contribute hundreds of millions of dollars toward making local content.

The brand has <a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/283548/the-volvo-concept-recharge-is-a-manifesto-for-volvo-cars-pure-electric-future">unveiled</a> a Concept Recharge design that shows the direction for the company&#39;s &quot;pure&quot; EV future — both in aesthetics and technology.</p><p>The Concept Recharge ditches the usual engine bay and tucks a large battery into a flat floor. That makes for more interior space, of course, but also leads to shorter overhangs, a lower hood and a slicker roof profile. This also gives Volvo an excuse to streamline its look — the Concept Recharge removes &quot;all unnecessary elements&quot; and looks more like a tall hatchback despite its SUV-like vantage point.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ce7bfec0-d9b6-11eb-bf7f-51f572f13096" style="height:899;width:1600;" alt="Volvo Concept Recharge interior" data-uuid="a5a50144-49dc-3bd2-9951-8878b54dabfe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volvo</div></figure><p>The interior is equally stripped back and likened to a &quot;Scandinavian living room.&quot; You&#39;ll still get plenty of technology, though, including a digital dash and a 15-inch infotainment touchscreen.

However, it&#39;s safe to presume that many of the design cues and basic technological ideas will reach cars you can actually buy.

The messaging app is launching a new, Discord-like chat feature <a href="https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/new-tools-to-help-you-work-from-anywhere"><ins>called Huddles</ins></a>. The feature, along with new collaboration tools for sharing pre-recorded audio and video are, according to the company, meant to provide an alternative to the “endless stream of meetings” that have dominated many office workers’ calendars during the pandemic.</p><p>Huddles allows Slack users to create impromptu meetups either in direct messages or an existing channel. When a participant starts a Huddle, other members can quickly join and chat in real time, much like you would in Discord. Though it’s meant to be “camera-free,” Huddles does support screen-sharing for an extra layer of collaboration.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Slack says the feature is a good alternative to voice or video calls because it’s a more low-pressure way for workers to quickly chat without the need to schedule a meeting. Tamar Yehoshua, the company’s chief product officer, compared Huddles to the kinds of impromptu conversations that happen in offices but don’t often occur with remote work. “It’s as if you see people congregating in a conference room and you just stick your head in and then leave when you’re ready,” she said during a briefing with reporters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/a8f91260-d93d-11eb-bffb-bf9a98b87f7b" style="height:1400;width:1400;" alt="Slack created native video and screen recording tools with searchable transcripts.  " data-uuid="edb81be2-bb29-3ad8-962d-f572435e1ca3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Slack</div></figure><p>While Slack is the latest in a long list of companies embracing the audio trend kickstarted by Clubhouse, the company says it’s responding to the way that work has changed during the pandemic. After more than a year working from home, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/online-conferencing-video-chat-fatigue-172357939.html"><ins>Zoom fatigue</ins></a> is real. At the same time, many workers may <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-allows-working-from-home-indefinitely-182153248.html"><ins>never go</ins></a> back to the office — at least, not full-time. So it’s not surprising Slack would respond to these shifts.</p><p>Similarly, the company is also addressing the need to collaborate when everyone isn’t online at the same time. The <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/1500012915082-Schedule-messages-to-send-later"><ins>“schedule send”</ins></a> feature it recently previewed will now be rolling out. And the app is introducing new tools to share videos, voice and screen recordings within Slack.</p><p>While the app already allows users to swap video files within chats, the new tools go a step further. Users can record and share natively within a channel, and other team members can respond with a video or voice recording of their own. They also include live captioning, and both the recording and the accompanying transcription are searchable after the fact.</p><p>Finally, Slack also showed off a new directory tool for its business users called Slack Atlas. The feature adds more information to Slack’s existing profiles, such as org charts and employee start dates. It can also integrate with existing tools like Workday to automatically pull in relevant details to workers’ Slack profiles.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/slack-huddles-audio-143014019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cce239a9-f0bd-4674-a8a5-2c1a230794f1</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 14:30:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625014722</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T00:58:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5cc01850-d931-11eb-bf6f-4ff3886977d1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5cc01850-d931-11eb-bf6f-4ff3886977d1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Slack]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Channel members can see when there's a huddle in progress.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[slack huddles]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Renault plans to electrify two thirds of its cars by 2025]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Renault has been sending signals that it wants to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-renault-morphoz-concept-ev-transformer.html">accelerate its EV plans</a>, and it&#39;s now clear just how aggressive the firm will be. The French automaker now expects 65 percent of its lineup to be electrified by 2025 — potentially the &quot;greenest&quot; car mix in Europe, according to the company, and much better than an earlier 30 percent target. Its plans revolve around a lineup with 10 new electric cars, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/renault-5-ev-sustainability-push-120141741.html">reborn 5</a>, the 4ever (a modern Renault 4) and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/renaults-megane-e-vision-concept-previews-its-future-ev-lineup-085019542.html">Mégane EV</a>.</p><p>Up to 90 percent of cars in Renault&#39;s brand stable (which includes Alpine and Dacia) should be electric by 2030.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The strategy hinges in part on making EVs more accessible. Renault is prepping a new platform (CMF-BEV) that should reduce costs by a third compared to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-23-renault-zoe-impressions-ev-charging-network-paris-france.html">the Zoe</a> through an interchangeable battery, a &quot;right-sized&quot; 100kW powertrain and borrowed components from conventional cars. Renault is also focusing on more capable and affordable components, including more efficient nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries (with 20 percent more range versus alternatives) and an all-in-one powertrain that&#39;s roughly half as large as before while costing 30 percent less.</p><p>Renault is also hoping to cut the cost of recycling EV batteries to a third of its current levels by 2030, and have its Mobilize brand reuse batteries as stationary energy storage.</p><p>You&#39;ll have to wait a while for some of these cars. The Mégane arrives in 2022, and Alpine&#39;s &quot;dream garage&quot; will have to wait until 2024. Still, It&#39;s evident Renault wants to earn an eco-friendly reputation much sooner than originally expected.</p><p>Whether or not Renault will lead the pack is another matter. Volkswagen, for instance, <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-group-set-to-use-platform-model-for-issues-of-the-future-6893">hopes</a> to be the worldwide leader in electric vehicles by 2025 &quot;at the latest,&quot; and wants an all-electric European lineup by 2030. There&#39;s no guarantee rivals will meet their own goals, but Renault may have to tweak its plans again if it&#39;s going to stay ahead in a rapidly changing market.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/renault-electric-vehicle-ev-strategy-2025-142835578.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c62f53ca-0d10-4cd1-bbf2-4dcd71c22972</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 14:28:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625064400</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T14:46:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/0d15ab80-d9a4-11eb-b45c-d5c1691115a5" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/0d15ab80-d9a4-11eb-b45c-d5c1691115a5" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Olivier Martin-Gambier/Renault]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Renault 5 and Megane at the eWays Electro Pop presentation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Renault 5 and Megane at the eWays Electro Pop presentation]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube will stream the UEFA Women’s Champions League for free]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Soccer fans around the world will be able to watch the UEFA Women&#39;s Champions League for free over the next two seasons. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube"><ins>YouTube</ins></a> will stream every game from the competition in 2021-23.

The Halo band stood out as a screenless $100 wrist-band that required a monthly subscription for the bulk of its functions, and kicked up a ton of controversy with its tone-detecting feature. The company is continuing to deviate from industry trends like squeezing more sensors or adding more workout types and is instead rolling out a smartphone camera-driven service called Movement Health, which it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-halo-app-gets-functional-fitness-tests-and-corrective-exercises-130034361.html">announced earlier this month</a>.</p><p>Movement Health is another way Amazon is distinguishing itself from the sea of other fitness offerings. Instead of just tracking your steps, heart rate and sleep, which the Halo wearable does, the app also offers tools like body fat scanning and tone detecting. The latter feature was widely denounced at launch for listening in on all your conversations all the time. Even setting aside those concerns, Tone Detection isn’t very useful anyway — Amazon doesn’t provide enough context around each entry to help you understand why you sounded “angry” or “happy” at various points during the day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Amazon Halo general features</h2><p>But as someone who’s been trying to improve her general fitness and knows that weight is only one of many metrics towards an overall picture of your health, I’ve found the body fat scan helpful. As a recap, Amazon uses your phone’s camera to take front, back and side pictures of you, then analyzes it to deduce your body fat percentage. The company has cited study after study claiming its computer vision tool is more accurate than scales using bioimpedance, which send a mild electric current through your body. Pennington Biomedical Research Center even goes as far as to <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.10.21258595v1.full.pdf">say that its tests found</a> the Halo app “can be as accurate as the methods doctors use to measure body fat percentage.” That study, by the way, was funded by Amazon.</p><p>In my own experience with the band over the last few months, Halo&#39;s greatest draw is its app. The device itself, which doesn’t have a screen, is nondescript and underwhelming. It’s so plain that I didn’t even notice it was on a pile of laundry one day and accidentally tossed it into my washing machine. The good thing is that it survived being washed and dried. This might be the Nokia 3310 of wearables.</p><div id="b591367bca0c4a709e3e5f020cb45435"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mkOd5fptPm8?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Just like the old-school phone, the Halo band doesn’t do much. It houses a heart rate monitor and microphones to track your heart rate and tone (if you opt in). It also has an accelerometer to help it log your steps and sleep, as well as a multi-function button. There’s nothing wrong with a simple device that just does the basics, except that it costs $100. You could get all these features for a fraction of the price from a plethora of companies without having to pay an additional monthly subscription fee.</p><h2>Movement Health impressions and testing</h2><p>Where Amazon does stand out is in offerings like body fat scanning and Movement Health. The latter, which rolls out today, is intended to “improve the way you move.” I don’t like the idea that there’s something inherently wrong about the way some people move, but if you’ve ever wondered whether your joints might be stiffer than most, or you’ve had issues with back or shoulder pain, Movement Health might help. According to Amazon, it’s “based on functional fitness, which is your body’s readiness to execute the everyday movements you do without thinking — bending, reaching, lifting, twisting, pulling, pushing and even just walking.”</p><p>Basically, the Halo app can guide you through a quick mobility test, and through your phone camera it’ll assess your performance. I&#39;ve had it for just under two weeks. On my first attempt, I ran the test on my Pixel 4a, and per the app’s directions I turned my speaker volume up and set the phone on the ground leaning against a wall. It also suggested I wear form fitting clothes and tie my hair up. Once I framed myself within the outlined boundaries, the app showed an instructor that demonstrated each movement. I’d recommend using wireless headphones if you can for this part, as I struggled to hear the instructions over street noise in an apartment in Brooklyn.</p><p>The entire session was about 10 minutes long and Halo asked me to do sets of five movements like squats, lunges and overhead reaches — both facing the camera and to the side. Each time I successfully performed an action, it chimed and told me to repeat the action (when required). At the end, I got a report saying my performance was “great, you’re in the healthy range!” I scored 94 percent on Mobility and Stability, and 93 percent on Posture.</p><h2>Results and recommended exercises</h2><p>The app also displayed cards on each metric, explaining what they meant and how they related to my physiological performance. Scrolling further down, I also saw a detailed breakdown of things like “shoulder mobility,” “trunk stability,” “hip mobility,” “hip stability,” “lower mobility” and more. According to Amazon, “this assessment delivers comparable accuracy to an in-person assessment with a professional trainer.” I’ve yet to have a similar assessment with a professional trainer so I can’t vouch for that claim.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/1d76cda0-d923-11eb-bebf-008eafd8c6c4" alt="Amazon Halo Movement Health app screenshots" data-uuid="5e8d3f7e-dd67-3ec3-8459-a94aae83b1b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon Halo app screenshots</div></figure><p>Like the body fat scan tool and other Halo features, by the way, Amazon says “multiple layers of privacy and security are built into the service to keep data safe and in your control.” The assessment videos of you lunging and squatting are “encrypted in transit to the cloud, securely processed within seconds and then automatically deleted.” The company promises that no one ever sees them, whether or not you take Amazon at its word is your decision.</p><p>After analyzing your results, you can also check out the program of “corrective exercises” that Amazon recommends based on your performance. For me, the system suggested two sets of actions like 45 seconds of shinbox bridge extensions, 60 seconds of side lying t-spine rotation and 40 seconds of hip airplanes, for example. I’m meant to alternate these and do them at least three days a week for four weeks. Each set has a video led by physical therapist Dr. Kelly Starrett, as well as text laying out the movements. In the videos, Dr. Starrett explained not just how to perform each movement but also what areas it targets and how it helps your general mobility.</p><p>You can set up a schedule and reminders to have Amazon keep you on track via notifications on your phone. The company also recommends that you perform an assessment every two to four weeks, which will likely result in new sets of corrective exercises for you to use. Amazon says “if you’re looking for a little extra burn, you can also see an additional curated list of workout recommendations to provide a higher-intensity alternative.”</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>As someone who hits the gym or yoga mat three to four times a week, I didn’t see the need to add these exercises to my routine. Most of the moves are similar to what I get out of my yoga sessions. But if you’re plagued by joint or back issues, these videos might be a good, gentle way to start working on your mobility in those areas. Of course, this shouldn’t and can’t replace a visit to the doctor, but they could be a helpful supplement. So far, Movement Health and the body fat scans seem to be ways Amazon is trying to use its computer vision skills to improve the Halo app, making it much more useful than the band on its own. Too bad having the device tied to your account is a requirement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-movement-health-hands-on-available-today-130020705.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9910a480-c77c-43cb-b8b1-d35918337151</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 13:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625059734</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T13:29:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/02748a90-d9a7-11eb-a41f-3be77b40a7ea" width="1517" height="841" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/02748a90-d9a7-11eb-a41f-3be77b40a7ea" width="1517" height="841" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Amazon Halo app shown on a phone screen next to a wrist-worn wearable.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Halo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[WhatsApp is rolling out 'view once' messages to Android beta testers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is diving into ephemeral messaging. After debuting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-and-messenger-vanish-mode-190042935.html">self-erasing media and texts</a> on Messenger and Instagram, the social giant is rolling out a similar feature on WhatsApp. Starting today, the app&#39;s beta testers on Android have begun to receive a &quot;View Once&quot; mode that wipes photos and videos as soon as you view and dismiss them. You&#39;ll know if you have access to the new feature if you see a dedicated button (that looks like a timer) in the caption input field, according to the experts at <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-rolling-out-photos-and-videos-set-to-view-once/#more-9432"><em>WABetaInfo</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to be confused with WhatsApp&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-disappearing-roll-out-090000380.html">disappearing messages</a> — which delete within seven days — photos and video sent using view once mode are single-use only and vanish after you close them. You&#39;ll get a notification once your media has been viewed.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite the added sheen of privacy, there are some quirks you should be aware of before jumping in. As noted by <em>WABetaInfo, </em>disabling read receipts won&#39;t stop others from being notified if a view once message has been opened — though, you won&#39;t see when a recipient open yours. In groups, you&#39;ll be able to see when members have opened disappearing media even if you have read receipts disabled.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, there&#39;s nothing stopping people from screenshotting your message without you finding out. View once apparently still works if you send a message to someone who doesn&#39;t have access to the feature. Those on iOS will reportedly get the new mode at a later date.</p><p>Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-multi-device-support-soon-132418897.html">announced the feature</a> in June on the heels of its divisive WhatsApp privacy policy update. The tech giant was forced to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-postpones-privacy-policy-facebook-201439528.html">delay</a> the new rules to mid-May from early February following an outcry over its access to additional user data. Facebook also later <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-wont-limit-accounts-dont-accept-privacy-policy-160132557.html">backtracked</a> on its decision to limit WhatsApp features for those who didn&#39;t accept the changes. The company has previously painted ephemeral messaging as a way to encourage more authentic and intimate conversations.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-android-view-once-messages-124030396.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5857381c-688c-4022-b1a6-104e86267920</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 12:40:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625056303</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T12:31:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/52df3ee0-d99c-11eb-b7be-4e41069427c8" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/52df3ee0-d99c-11eb-b7be-4e41069427c8" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of the messenger app WhatsApp is seen on the screen of a smartphone in New Delhi, India on May 27, 2021.

They&#39;ll sit just below LG&#39;s flagship OLED and consist of two 8K models (the QNED99 and QNED95) along with the 4K QNED90, in sizes from 65 to 85 inches. The TVs will launch first in North America and arrive to other regions in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>The new sets will use Mini LED tech that blends characteristics from both OLED and LED. Unlike regular LED models, Mini LED uses thousands of tiny LEDs, up to 30,000 for the 86-inch 8K QNED99. With so many more so-called dimming zones, the QNED sets will be able to display deeper blacks and offer more contrast than regular LED TVs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/94d9e560-d993-11eb-9bff-be5309f89670" style="height:1308;width:2000;" alt="LG&#39;s &#39;QNED&#39; Mini LED TVs are coming to the US in July" data-uuid="e82aa932-1e1a-38c2-97a4-6241a70830e4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG</div></figure><p>At the same time, they offer more brightness than OLED TVs, though contrast and black levels aren&#39;t as good. Also, unlike with OLED, you&#39;ll occasionally see &quot;blooming&quot; or blockiness around bright areas when the dimming zone is larger than the light source on the screen. Mini LED is not to be mistaken with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-microled-tvs-ces-160052013.html">MicroLED</a> either, as the latter is a completely different (currently very expensive) technology that works more like OLED, with individual LEDs for each pixel.&nbsp;</p><p>The models have all the specs you&#39;d expect in a high-end TV, including brightness levels up to 3,000 nits, HDR10, HLG and Dolby Vision HDR support, along with Dolby Atmos for sound. All models offer 120 Hz native refresh rates with AMD FreeSync support, and LG <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-tvs-120-hz-dolby-vision-gaming-114549499.html">revealed yesterday</a> that the QNED99 models would have 120 Hz Dolby Vision gaming support when they arrive in July. You&#39;ll also get LG&#39;s Magic Remote, ThinQ AI, webOS smart TV features and Apple AirPlay 2 &amp; HomeKit support.&nbsp;</p><p>LG didn&#39;t reveal the pricing in its press release, but B&amp;H Photo Video already has most of the lineup <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo Video;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:up on preorder" href="https://fave.co/3ybxksb">up on preorder</a>. Prices start at $1,997 for the QNED90 65-inch 4K model, with the 75- and 86-inch 4K QNED90 sets at $2,997 and $3,997, respectively. The QNED99 8K sets jump jump considerably as you&#39;d imagine, with the 65-inch model priced at $3,497, the 75-inch model at $4,797 and the flagship 86-inch model at $6,497.

The search giant has <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/further-measures-help-fight-financial-fraud-uk/">announced</a> that starting in the fall it will only run ads for financial products and services from sources that have been cleared by the UK&#39;s financial watchdog.&nbsp;</p><p>Google said it will update its policy from August 30th and begin enforcing the rules a week later on September 6th. At that point, advertisers will have to demonstrate that they are authorized by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or qualify for its limited exemptions. According to Google, the requirement covers financial products and services that go beyond the regulator&#39;s ambit.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The decision didn&#39;t happen overnight, however. Google has been on the end of mounting criticism from regulators, law enforcement and consumer groups over its perceived lack of action against scrupulous ads. According to trade body <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/press/press-releases/criminals-exploit-covid-19-pandemic-rise-scams-targeting-victims-online">UK Finance</a>, investment scam cases on search engines saw a 32 percent increase last year. These typically involve criminals duping victims into moving their money to a fictitious fund (such as a pension pot) or to pay for a fake investment. Losses incurred from the fake ads totaled over £135 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the FCA threatened to take legal action against Google and social media companies after it issued 1,200 warnings about fraudulent ads on their platforms, double the amount from 2019. The regulator told a parliamentary committee that it was able to start taking action in the wake of Brexit. In the past, the FCA had been bound by EU rules on financial ads that did not apply to online platforms.</p><p>Others blamed Google&#39;s system for the failings. UK consumer group <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/2021/04/two-in-five-victims-of-online-scam-adverts-dont-report-to-host-platforms/"><em>Which?</em></a> found that 51 percent of the 1,870 search engine users it surveyed didn&#39;t know how to report suspicious ads in search listings. The perceived inertia from Google led some lawmakers to claim that it was content to continue profiting from the bogus ads. MPs told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/14/uk-regulator-warns-google-about-accepting-scam-adverts"><em>The Guardian</em></a> that the company was benefiting from online scammers who paid to host ads on its platforms. While the FCA had also paid Google more than £600,000 ($830,000) in 2020 and 2021 to run ‘anti-scam’ ads.</p><p>For its part, Google claims it has improved its ad screening rules using a mix of machine learning and human review. The tech giant removed <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/ads-safety-report-2020/">3.1 billion</a> adverts that violated its policies in 2020 according to its ad transparency report. It also began verifying advertisers in January by requiring them to submit legal identification, business incorporation documents and proof of the country in which they operate. Back in 2018, Google followed in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-30-facebook-bans-ads-promoting-cryptocurrencies.html">Facebook&#39;s</a> footsteps by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-14-google-ban-cryptocurrency-ads-june.html">banning cryptocurrency ads</a>.</p><p>“This new update builds on significant work in partnership with the FCA over the last 18 months to help tackle this issue,” Ronan Harris, vice president and MD, Google UK and Ireland, said in a blog post. “Today’s announcement reflects significant progress in delivering a safer experience for users, publishers and advertisers. While we understand that this policy update will impact a range of advertisers in the financial services space, our utmost priority is to keep users safe on our platforms — particularly in an area so disproportionately targeted by fraudsters.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-financial-ads-uk-regulator-115001895.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9bcdd36-281f-4898-8941-182eb6720298</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 11:50:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625057640</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T12:54:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a2e6b60-bd5b-11eb-b7af-a061aa240238" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a2e6b60-bd5b-11eb-b7af-a061aa240238" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEATTLE, UNITED STATES - 2021/04/27: The Google logo seen at the entrance to Google Cloud campus in Seattle.

As you can see, all of the seats will have entertainment screens, which while great for passengers could also cause a bit of a headache. At full capacity, passengers may have trouble pairing their earphones as everyone tries to connect to Bluetooth at the same time.</p><div id="85d55826ea7f47998288079cd750eb6b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The main attraction of <a href="https://twitter.com/united?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@united</a>&#39;s new interior is the new <a href="https://twitter.com/PanasonicAero?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@PanasonicAero</a> seatback IFE system.

They&#39;ll be &quot;jointly developing selected content and exchanging know-how&quot; on both new and existing game properties. &quot;We look forward to combining Bloober Team’s and our respective characteristics and strengths to create high-quality content,&quot; said Konami President Hideki Hayakawa in a statement.</p><p>The news should perk up the ears of <em>Silent Hill</em> fans hoping for a new chapter. Bloober&#39;s <em>The Medium</em> is also a horror-style game (even using a score from <em>Silent Hill </em>composer Akira Yamaoka) with players flipping between real and afterlife versions of the world.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of that, Bloober Team CEO dropped a hint earlier this year that it was working on something interesting. &quot;In fact, we&#39;ve been working for more than a year on another gaming project, another horror IP, and we&#39;re doing this with a very famous gaming publisher,&quot; he told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-18-bloober-team-adding-action-to-its-psychological-horror-focus"><em>Gamesindustry.biz</em></a> in February.  &quot;I can&#39;t tell you who. I can&#39;t tell you what the project is, but I&#39;m pretty sure when people realize we&#39;re working on it, they will be very excited.&quot;</p><p>Nothing about any <em>Silent Hill </em>IP has been confirmed, though, and it&#39;d be understandable if<em>&nbsp;</em>fans remain skeptical. A <em>Silent Hills</em> sequel with Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro and Norman Reedus was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-27-silent-hills-hideo-kojima-del-toro-canceled.html">canceled</a> back in 2015 — despite the appearance of an impressive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-13-kojima-discusses-collaboration-with-del-toro-for-silent-hills.html">playable teaser</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the Konami and Bloober Team partnership is a promising development. <em>The Medium</em> generally met with good reviews, though our own Jessica Condit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/medium-xbox-series-s-review-160039546.html">found it</a> a bit &quot;medium,&quot; as it were. The game&#39;s &quot;dual reality&quot; switching was also well done, so if the two companies combine their horror chops and technology, it could result in some compelling IP.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/konami-strategic-partnership-the-medium-developer-bloober-101519819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7f88db1-b888-4961-a718-47d1ffacf43f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 10:15:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625048599</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T10:23:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/207900c0-d989-11eb-9d3d-bf4c0536ea4f" width="2600" height="1463" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/207900c0-d989-11eb-9d3d-bf4c0536ea4f" width="2600" height="1463" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bloober]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Konami enters into 'strategic partnership' with 'The Medium' developer Bloober]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Konami enters into 'strategic partnership' with 'The Medium' developer Bloober]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AirCar prototype completes its first inter-city flight]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The term flying car is a bit of a misnomer. In order to meet regulatory guidelines, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kitty-hawk-flyer-heaviside-045616682.html/">many</a> of the <a href="https://japanese.engadget.com/toyotabacked-sky-drive-conducts-a-public-flight-test-of-a-flying-car-073058482.html">vehicles</a> currently in development are more like manned drones or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airspeeder-electric-flying-race-car-test-flight-175132594.html">vertical take-off and landing</a> aircraft (VTOL). But, a prototype that just achieved a major milestone actually fits the flying car description.&nbsp;</p><p>A Slovakian company known as Klein Vision recently completed its inaugural inter-city flight between the Nitra and Bratislava airports. At the end of the 35-minute journey, the vehicle&#39;s inventor, professor Stefan Klein, clicked a button to tuck in its wings and drove the car home straight from the tarmac.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e5d52efbab984777b2befb5081f644ff"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2tDOYkFCYo?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The company has been working on its hybrid aircraft for more than 30 years. With 142 successful landings and over 40 hours of test flights under its belt, Klein is convinced that his third prototype is ready to leap past the concept stage. As part of its latest breakthrough, the two-seater AirCar reached a cruising speed of 170km/h, slightly below the max 190km/h. Klein says the car has flown at 8200 ft and achieved steep 45 degree turns as part of its maneuverability testing. Unlike VTOL vehicles, the AirCar requires a runway for takeoff and landing.</p><p>The current prototype is equipped with a 160HP BMW engine with a fixed-propeller and a ballistic parachute. Klein has even bigger plans for its follow-up. He claims the 300HP pre-production model will receive the CS-23 aircraft certification for normal, utility, aerobatic and commuter aeroplanes from European aviation regulators, along with an M1 road permit.</p><p>In reality, getting there could still prove a challenge. The company will have to tread a fine line between a light aircraft and a more substantial vehicle with health and safety precautions built-in. However, there <em>are</em> signs that regulators are coming round to the idea of flying cars. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration recently granted <a href="https://www.flyingmag.com/story/aircraft/terrafugia-transition-faa-slsa-certification/">Terrafugia&#39;s</a> roadable airplane a special certificate in the light sport category (S-LSA), making it legal for flight.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/aircar-first-inter-city-flight-092852060.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">54afa51c-7340-4979-86da-1f7603136c85</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 09:28:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625057556</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T12:53:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/e8580d80-d983-11eb-aefd-87632fd18a64" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/e8580d80-d983-11eb-aefd-87632fd18a64" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Klein Visions]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Klein AirCar]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Klein AirCar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO Max expands beyond the US to 39 new territories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As it announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-latin-america-caribbean-release-date-155038331.html">earlier this year</a>, HBO Max is finally moving outside the US, <a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max/hbo-max-rolls-out-39-territories-latin-america-and-caribbean-starting-today">expanding</a> to 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. &quot;With today’s launch, we are introducing our global platform and providing a brand new user experience to millions of fans across Latin America and the Caribbean,&quot; said HBO Max International head Johannes Larcher in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike HBO Max in the US, subscribers in those regions won&#39;t have the option of an ad-supported plan.

An external investigation conducted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/hackers-exploited-0-day-not-2018-bug-to-mass-wipe-my-book-live-devices/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> and <a href="https://censys.io/blog/cve-2018-18472-western-digital-my-book-live-mass-exploitation/">Derek Abdine</a> (CTO at security firm Censys) has revealed, however, that the bad actors exploited another undocumented vulnerability in a file aptly named system_factory_restore.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, users would have to type in their passwords to be able to perform factory resets on their devices. Indeed, the script in the file contains lines to password protect the reset command. However, someone in  Western Digital &quot;commented out&quot; or, in non-technical parlance, canceled out the command by adding the double / character at the beginning of each line. HD Moore, a security expert, explained to <em>Ars</em> that this doesn&#39;t make things look good for the company. &quot;It’s like they intentionally enabled the bypass,&quot; Moore said, since the attackers would have to know the format of the script that triggers the reset to exploit the vulnerability.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Devices that were hacked using the CVE-2021-35941 vulnerability were infected with malware, and in at least one case, it was malware that makes a device part of a botnet. Since turning My Book Live storage devices into botnets and then wiping them clean makes no sense, Abdine&#39;s theory is that one hacker exploited the CVE-2021-35941 vulnerability. After that, a second (possibly rival) hacker exploited the previously unknown reset vulnerability to gain control of the devices, which were then made part of a botnet, or to undo the first one&#39;s work.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, this event just goes to show that the My Book Live storage devices aren&#39;t as secure as anybody would like at this point. Those who still own it should heed Western Digital&#39;s advice and disconnect it from the internet as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/western-digital-my-book-live-factory-reset-two-vulnerabilities-044122712.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3414384c-1900-4e70-9b4e-a62a43870594</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 04:41:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625028070</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T04:41:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/4e5fd930-5f9d-11ea-b5ae-fc08cc74aaf1" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-03/4e5fd930-5f9d-11ea-b5ae-fc08cc74aaf1" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[playb via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close up of Unrecognizable man sitting at desk and working on laptop at night]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Man sitting at desk and working on laptop at night]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Little Tikes made a Peloton-style stationary bike for kids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Young kids who see their folks on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-corporate-wellness-134436951.html">Peloton</a> bike and want to join in on workouts will soon have another way to do that. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/little-tikes-smartwatch-kids-tobi-robot-173711237.html">Little Tikes</a> has created a smart stationary bike for children aged three to seven.

The company is fundamentally shifting the way many aspects of Windows works, with a centered taskbar and redesigned Start menu, among other changes. But it&#39;s still Windows, so at its core it still works like it always has. There&#39;s the focus on productivity that Microsoft leaned into with Windows 10, along with subtler improvements that makes for a more pleasant user experience. At this point, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-launch-microsoft-151140403.html">Windows 11</a> feels like an OS that will please PC diehards and mainstream users alike.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="a830ca55-60a1-4839-b5cc-a22a568e8882"/><p>At first glance, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-insider-preview-170004505.html">Windows 11 Insider Preview</a>, which started rolling out on Monday, doesn&#39;t look much different from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-leak-hands-on-windows-10-macos-224819963.html">leaked build we covered a few weeks ago</a>. The centered and icon-filled taskbar still looks distinctly Mac-like; the rounded window corners give off a slightly more polished vibe; and the redesigned Start menu is sure to be controversial. It features pinned app shortcuts up top, recommended files at the bottom, and a link in the top right to see the entire unfiltered Start Menu.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This Start menu is certainly different, but after testing out the leaked build for two weeks, I&#39;ve grown to prefer the changes. I&#39;ve never met anyone who used the Live Tiles in Windows 10&#39;s Start menu, and those were just a distilled remnant from Windows 8&#39;s horrific full-screen Start page. It&#39;s nice to be rid of that legacy, once and for all.</p><p>As I dug further into the preview build, I noticed small tweaks throughout that just felt, well, <em>nice. </em>Instead of combining notifications and system shortcuts into a single right-hand pane, they&#39;re now broken up across two screens. Hitting the clock in the Windows 11 taskbar brings up all of your notifications, along with a full calendar. The system shortcuts, meanwhile, are combined into a single screen that pop up when you press the Wi-Fi, sound or battery icons.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcc53b0-d919-11eb-bfff-765f26f85a03" alt="Windows 11 Insider Preview" data-uuid="68ce3b55-2876-3947-afd7-df7c39d9458b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>From there, you can join other wireless networks, and turn Bluetooth on and off, along with airplane, battery saver or Focus assist modes. Sliders along the bottom also let you manage your volume and screen brightness. This isn&#39;t that different from Windows 10, but the overall look is a lot cleaner and easier to read. (Maybe I&#39;m just sick of hitting the &quot;More options&quot; to expand Windows 10&#39;s shortcut settings.)</p><p>Microsoft is also clearly pushing a taskbar UI that <em>only</em> features icons in Windows 11. It&#39;s something the company started doing with Windows 7, but up until Windows 10 you always had the option to turn on labels for taskbar icons (at least, until they started piling up too much). While it tended to make Windows look a bit messy, I always liked being able to see what a window contained before I actually clicked on it. Windows 11 no longer has label options of any kind, and there&#39;s no indication that Microsoft wants to bring them back. They just don&#39;t fit into the neat aesthetic the company is aiming for now.</p><p>At first I figured losing labels would be a pain, but I&#39;ve grown used to living with an icon-filled taskbar over the last few weeks. And I&#39;d gladly lose labels in exchange for better multitasking features, like this new OS&#39;s revamped window snapping. Now you can hover your mouse pointer over any app&#39;s maximize button to see an array of areas to snap it to, like the top left or bottom right of your screen. It&#39;s much more accurate than dragging a screen to a specific spot and hoping Windows automatically snaps it into place.</p><section data-eng-breakout="0794bffec2d8462e91f4e4f358fa8cc6" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcc53b1-d919-11eb-bffd-576340725013" alt="Windows 11 Insider Preview"></section><p>Whenever you use the quick snap feature, Windows 11 also shows you all of the other apps you&#39;re running in the other portions of your screen. So if you shove Slack to the top right, you can have Edge take over the entire left side and put Spotify in the lower right within a few seconds. It may sound confusing, but in practice it&#39;s a smart way to make sense of all your open windows. Snapping at least two apps together also creates a snap group in the taskbar, allowing you to easily bring up their arrangement in the future.</p><p>And if you want to take things to another level, you can customize several virtual desktops from Windows 11&#39;s task view. You can reach that by hitting the Windows key plus Tab, or by enabling the Task View shortcut in the taskbar. That&#39;s useful for creating entirely different work modes — say, one desktop for managing email and Slack, and another for focusing purely on writing. Having different spaces could help you stay in your productive “flow”, a concept Microsoft has practically made its corporate philosophy now. (Drink every time someone says &quot;flow&quot; at the next Windows event.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcc0591-d919-11eb-bdcb-00826bce6285" alt="Windows 11 Insider Preview" data-uuid="f12ee116-0036-3185-8505-65cc170f17ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>One major addition with this Windows 11 preview is the new File Explorer, which wasn&#39;t fully baked in the leaked build. Now, in addition to file and folder icons, there&#39;s also a simplified toolbar at the top of the screen. But while it&#39;s far sleeker than the Windows 10 explorer, which could get seriously cluttered if you had the Office-style Ribbon toolbar open, it&#39;s also a bit confusing. There are the usual cut, copy and paste commands, but it took me a while to figure out one of the other buttons lets you rename files. I suppose it&#39;s still easier to figure out than the Ribbon though, so I&#39;ll call it a win for Microsoft.</p><p>The new Windows 11 settings app is a clearer upgrade. Like before, it&#39;s where you&#39;ll go to tweak just about everything in your PC, but now it&#39;s organized neatly into two panes. Along the left, you can choose the section, like “Bluetooth &amp; devices,” or “Network and internet.” Along the right, you can drill down into specific settings. And if you don&#39;t have a clear sense of what you&#39;re looking for, the search bar at the top left can point you in the right direction (this is also true for every search bar throughout the OS). It seems like a silly thing to get excited about, but the new settings app could make it far easier for less tech-savvy users to adjust their systems. I can&#39;t help but applaud that.</p><section data-eng-breakout="edc3c369b96d44db97e3789d66b36be7" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fca30d0-d919-11eb-bcef-0180a9f9f00f" alt="Windows 11 Insider Preview"></section><p>Among other notable additions, there&#39;s also a redesigned Microsoft Store app in Windows 11. It has a navigation bar along its left side, rather than section tabs from before. Again, this seems to be a deliberate step away from Microsoft&#39;s aging Metro design, which was all about top-level tabs. Widgets also make a return in this OS, something we haven&#39;t seen since Windows 7. Now they pop up on the left side of the screen when you hit the Widgets button in the taskbar. At this point, they&#39;re just simple square apps that can show you the weather, your calendar entries, or upcoming esports matches at a glance. There&#39;s room for Microsoft to make them more useful, but it&#39;s unclear how much the company plans to invest in widgets moving forward.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcacd10-d919-11eb-9ef7-24f67d916ffa" alt="Windows 11 Insider Preview" data-uuid="7d8480a3-eaa0-37fb-afe6-99c864c731b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Some of the Windows 11 features I&#39;m most excited to try aren&#39;t yet available in this preview. That includes the ability to run Android apps, built-in Microsoft Teams chat, and AutoHDR for older games. Similarly, I haven&#39;t been able to test some intriguing new features that actually have been included, like the ability to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-dynamic-refresh-rate-191145232.html"> automatically change your refresh rate</a> while inking or scrolling. That&#39;s only possible on high-refresh-rate monitors that you typically find on gaming screens. Unfortunately, then, my Surface Laptop 4 review unit won&#39;t cut it. Still, I can imagine it being useful. Normally, I just leave gaming notebooks at their highest refresh rate, which makes scrolling and any sort of screen movement look buttery smooth. But that&#39;s not the best idea if you&#39;re trying to conserve battery life.</p><p>Even though this is the first Windows 11 Insider preview, it&#39;s easy to understand Microsoft&#39;s vision for its next OS. It&#39;s all about delivering a polished, uncluttered experience to make you more productive. If you&#39;d like to try it out yourself, I&#39;d strongly recommend testing it on a secondary computer. There are still some bugs that require the occasional reboot (and Microsoft is still trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-preview-system-requirements-202709366.html">sort out installation requirements</a>). Sometimes the auto-snap features just disappear, for example, and the old File Explorer Ribbon interface reappears. Microsoft clearly has a lot of work left to do. But at the very least, Windows 11 appears to justify an entirely new version number.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-hands-on-microsoft-insider-preview-215041175.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e5bedadf-2df9-49ff-9a5e-b9c5d13a204b</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 21:30:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625001230</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T21:14:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcc0590-d919-11eb-a7ff-f21957fe4253" width="2000" height="1261" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/9fcc0590-d919-11eb-a7ff-f21957fe4253" width="2000" height="1261" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Windows 11 Insider Preview]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Windows 11 Insider Preview]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Former BioWare GM Casey Hudson starts new game studio]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Less than a year after announcing his decision to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bioware-casey-hudson-mark-darrah-retirement-220706781.html"><ins>“retire” from BioWare</ins></a>, Casey Hudson has shared details on his latest project.

In a change spotted by <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ossbsscx/t-mobile-taps-esim-tech-for-free-network-test-drive/d/d-id/770535?"><em><ins>Light Reading</ins></em></a>, the carrier has expanded its <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/offers/free-trial">existing Test Drive</a> program to include eSIM-compatible iPhones. To take advantage of the promotion, you need an iPhone XS or newer with iOS 14.5 or later installed on your device. Provided you meet those requirements, you can download the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/t-mobile-network-test-drive/id1521545162"><ins>Network Test Drive</ins></a> app and follow the on-screen instructions to get up to 30 days or 30GB of data for free.</p><p>While testing the network, there’s no need to change your phone number or provide T-Mobile with your billing information. What’s more, if you have an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">iPhone 12</a>, you can even try out the carrier’s 5G connectivity. As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555810/t-mobile-test-drive-iphone-esim"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em><ins> notes</ins></a>, the Test Drive program has been around since 2014. If you don’t have access to a phone with eSIM support, T-Mobile will instead lend you a WiFi hotspot. Essentially, this gives people a more hassle-free way to take advantage of the program.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, T-Mobile’s hope here is that you’ll come away from the test willing to switch over to its service. That could help it get an edge as AT&amp;T and Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) use their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fcc-c-band-spectrum-auction-225551917.html"><ins>recently acquired C-band spectrum</ins></a> to try and catch up to the company’s 5G lead.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-network-test-drive-iphone-esim-201512684.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d8d66cdd-0d47-4120-90ea-a879ac4d54c5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 20:15:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1624997122</ingested><modified>2021-06-29T20:05:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/3afef9f0-7ab5-11eb-bd7f-121fb1272d3e" width="3000" height="1658" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/3afef9f0-7ab5-11eb-bd7f-121fb1272d3e" width="3000" height="1658" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 12 lineup]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 12 lineup]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Black & Decker launches a line of emergency wearables for seniors]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Black &amp; Decker has <a href="https://www.blackanddeckerhealth.com/goviahome/">launched</a> a new health division with a lineup of personal emergency response (PERS) wearables aimed at seniors.

It comes with cellular coverage from Verizon&#39;s 4G LTE network along with location tracking via GPS, WiFi and triangulation. If the wearer encounters an emergency, they can press the call button and speak with an operator directly through the device. A responder can then come directly to their location.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/b19f2290-c913-11eb-bcdf-9ce3a93938d2" alt="Black &amp; Decker launches a line of emergency wearables for seniors" data-uuid="562cf1ca-3fb5-34f2-8bed-8e51d5c7fad5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Black &amp; Decker</div></figure><p>The goVia Move (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$75" href="https://amzn.to/2TdnYO6">$75</a>) works in a similar way, but offers portable wearable help buttons that can be worn on the wrist. In case of emergency, you can press on either the button on the Move device itself or the portable button, though the latter has to be within 300 feet of the main unit. That will again connect you to an operator directly through the device, who can then send help to your location determined by a GPS.&nbsp;</p><p>The $45 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:goVia Home Classic" href="https://amzn.to/3AeAQ6W">goVia Home Classic</a> device connects to a landline rather than a cellular service and includes a neck pendant or wristband (with a 600 foot range) that can be used to call for help at the press of a button.  Black &amp; Decker Health also offers the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$50 goVia Home Wireless" href="https://amzn.to/3x7tnoy">$50 goVia Home Wireless</a> version that uses AT&amp;T&#39;s cellular services rather than a landline. Both offer a fall detection option (for an additional monthly cost) that can automatically detect motion changes caused by a fall and impact and automatically connect to emergency operators without the need for a landline.</p><p>While the devices themselves are relatively inexpensive, they all require monthly monitoring subscriptions provided by Medical Guardian that aren&#39;t cheap. The goVia Mini&#39;s service plan costs $39.95 per month, the goMove service is $44.95 a month, Home Classic is $29.95 monthly and Home Wireless is $34.95 per month, or $44.95 per month with fall detection.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/black-decker-launches-a-line-of-emergency-wearables-for-seniors-194551519.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b966af90-b53a-4e56-9b93-db2438f6bcb4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jun 2021 19:45:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625057448</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T12:51:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/cc707c10-c907-11eb-bcfb-4760b5982f23" width="1500" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/cc707c10-c907-11eb-bcfb-4760b5982f23" width="1500" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Black & Decker]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Black & Decker launches a line of emergency wearables for seniors]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Black & Decker launches a line of emergency wearables for seniors]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Control' is getting a co-op spin-off game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Remedy Entertainment&#39;s excellent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/control"><em><ins>Control</ins></em></a> is one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-games-for-ps5-playstation-5-171511880.html"><ins>most memorable games</ins></a> of the past few years.
