Disney didn&#39;t say when you might expect on-demand versions of these titles, whether on Disney+ or rival services.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is partly a reaction to the relatively strong theater-only releases of summer extravaganzas like <em>Free Guy</em> and <em>Shang-Chi</em>. While COVID-19 still hurt box office numbers (<em>Shang-Chi</em>&#39;s $75.5 million US opening paled in comparison to multiple Disney 2019 releases), the revenue may have been enough to justify returning to pre-pandemic distribution.</p><p>There&#39;s also the matter of placating key factions. Disney said it has a way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-compensate-talent-black-widow-lawsuit-070554946.html">pay talent fairly</a> for hybrid theater-and-digital relases, but it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Scarlett Johansson&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html"><em>Black Widow</em> lawsuit</a> plays a role in considering Disney+ launches. The company might not want to risk further trouble with actors and others whose income depends on theatrical performance. And then there&#39;s the theaters themselves. When chains like AMC vowed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/trolls-word-tour-pvod-amc-062745004.html">pull Universal movies</a> even when many locations were closed, Disney might not be willing to provoke a similar confrontation as theaters resume business.</p><p>This and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming-2022-161147104.html">Warner Bros.&#39; 2022 return to theaters</a> supports the expectations of many cynics — that studios only saw day-one streaming access as a temporary necessity that would disappear the moment it was reasonably safe to watch on big screens. That&#39;s not completely shocking when the movie industry&#39;s business model still revolves around theaters, but any fundamental shifts in strategy might not happen for a long, long time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8719f9c-54f8-4def-8683-dd5f65889f40</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 16:13:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631376790</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T16:13:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7e6c1950-1314-11ec-bddf-a3134f0dd19c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7e6c1950-1314-11ec-bddf-a3134f0dd19c" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mika Baumeister on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Disney+ on Android phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Disney+ on Android phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How Florence Nightingale changed medicine using stats and 'rose charts']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During Crimean War, hospitals of the day weren&#39;t so much centers of healing or recovery as they were the places where injured combatants went to die slightly more slowly. Turkey&#39;s Scutari hospital was one such notorious example. Converted by the British Empire from army barracks, Scutari lacked every imaginable amenity, from basic sanitation to sufficient ventilation, this &quot;hospital&quot; served as a potent incubator for myriad infectious diseases — that is until Florence Nightingale and her team of volunteer nurses arrived in 1854.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674971721"><em>Maladies of Empire</em></a> by Jim Downs explores how many aspects of modern medicine are borne on the backs of humanity&#39;s most abhorrent impulses, though in the excerpt below, Downs illustrates how one woman&#39;s unyielding tenacity and fastidious record keeping helped launch the field of preventative medicine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b3ea0be0-0fff-11ec-b5cb-197e93c2d343" alt="Maladies of Empire" data-uuid="3cd128b6-22ae-3b1b-aba7-030287f4a386"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Belknap Press</div></figure><p><em>Excerpted from </em><a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674971721"><em>MALADIES OF EMPIRE: HOW COLONIALISM, SLAVERY, AND WAR TRANSFORMED MEDICINE </em></a><em>by JIM DOWNS, published by The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press.

She took notes on everything from cleanliness to the quantity of supplies to diet to the placement of latrines and graveyards.</p><p>She also carefully examined the physical space. She took careful note of the size of the wards, the condition of the roof, and the quality, size, and placement of the windows. In her book on the health of the British army, like Thomas Trotter and others who wrote about the importance of fresh air, she pointed to the problem of improper ventilation, and she devoted an entire section to “bad ventilation.” She quoted the report of the sanitary commission, which remarked on the “defective state of the ventilation” in the Barrack Hospital. There were only “a few small openings here and there,” so that there was no way for the “hot and foul” air to escape. As an adherent of the miasma theory, she believed that diseases were spread through the air and advocated for ventilation to release the “foul air” from hospitals.</p><p>In addition to inadequate ventilation, Nightingale pointed to poor drainage and badly designed sewers and plumbing. In her testimony to the royal commission, Nightingale reported on the filthy conditions she found in the Barrack Hospital when she arrived. “The state of the privies... for several months, more than an inch deep in filth, is too horrible to describe.” She observed six dead dogs under one of the windows, and a dead horse lay in the aqueduct for weeks. The drinking water was dirty; once she saw used hospital uniforms in the water tank. Rats and insects abounded, and “the walls and ceilings were saturated with organic matter.”</p><p>In the conclusion to her report on the health of the British Army, she explained, “We have much more information on the sanitary history of the Crimean campaign than we have upon any other, but because it is a complete exam (history does not afford its equal) of an army, after failing to the lowest ebb of disease and disaster from neglects committed, rising again to the highest state of health and efficiency from remedies applied.</p><p>&quot;It is the whole experiment on a colossal scale.” She pointed out that during the first seven months of the Crimean campaign, mortality exceeded that of the plague of 1665 as well as that of recent cholera epidemics. But during the last six months of the war, after sanitary reforms had been made, “we had... a mortality among our sick little more than that among our healthy Guards at home.”</p><p>Using mortality data that she had collected during the war, along with domestic mortality statistics, Nightingale showed that between 1839 and 1853, mortality among soldiers was much higher than among civilian men: “of 10,000 soldiers [at the age of 20], 7,077 live to the age of 39, out of whom 135 die in the next year of age; whereas out of 10,000 civilians at the age of 20, 8,253 attain the age of 39, and of those 106 die in the year of age following.” Nearly all mortality among soldiers was the result of disease; “actual losses in battle form a very small part of the calamities of a long war.” Nightingale classified the causes of death as “zymotic diseases” (which in the nineteenth century referred to infectious diseases such as fevers, measles, and cholera), “chest and tubercular diseases,” and “all other diseases (including violent deaths).” Nightingale was critical of the army’s classification system for diseases. At the bottom of a chart, she notes, “Bronchitis and influenza have no place in the Army nomenclature. The chronic catarrh of the Army Returns is believed to be really phthisis, in the great majority of cases; acute catarrh comprehends both epidemic catarrh, or influenza and bronchitis.”</p><p>Nightingale presented statistics using charts, tables, and diagrams, which were just beginning to appear in research reports, to make it easier for readers to visualize the comparison she was making. She developed a new kind of graphic, called a “rose chart,” also known as a coxcomb chart or polar area diagram, to present mortality data from the Crimean War. Each chart, which is laid out like a pie, shows data from one year, with the slices representing months. Each slice is divided into colored segments whose area is proportional to the number of deaths.</p><p>One segment is for deaths from wounds, a second for “preventable or mitigable zymotic diseases,” and a third for all other causes. A quick glance at the charts of deaths from April 1854 to March 1855 and April 1855 to March 1856 is enough to show that many more deaths were caused by disease than by combat, and that overall mortality decreased in the second year.</p><p>To further make visible the dangers of unsanitary hospitals, Nightingale gathered mortality data for matrons, nuns, and nurses working in fifteen London hospitals who died of the “zymotic diseases” of fever and cholera. She presented tables, which she notes William Farr compiled for her, showing that the mortality rate of the nursing staff was much higher than that of the female population in London; in addition, women working in hospitals were more likely to die of zymotic diseases than were other women. She used these figures to argue for the “very great importance” of hygiene in hospitals. “The loss of a well-trained nurse by preventible [sic] disease,” she wrote, “is a greater loss than is that of a good soldier from the same cause. Money cannot replace either, but a good nurse is more difficult to find than a good soldier.”</p><p>In her book Notes on Hospitals, she retold the story of the British prisoners of war who died in a crowded jail cell in India in 1756: “Shut up 150 people in a Black hole of Calcutta, and in twenty-four hours an infection is produced so intense that it will, in that time, have destroyed nearly the whole of the inmates.” Nightingale’s reference to the case is evidence for its status as the prototypical illustration of the need for ventilation. And the fact that it took place in India shows how British medical authorities used information from around the empire.</p><p>As a result of her work with large numbers of patients in the Crimean War, Nightingale framed her analysis like an epidemiologist, in terms of populations. She focused on how disease spread within a group. She devoted her energies not to changing bedpans or dressing wounds but to studying the structure of hospitals, analyzing statistics, and figuring out how to increase ventilation.</p><p>The war provided her the opportunity to compare mortality rates in varied settings: crowded hospitals, shabby tents, and wooden huts. It also underscored to her the importance of preventive measures, which constitutes one of the major tenets of modern epidemiology. By publishing her observations, her insights, and guidelines for hospitals to follow, she hoped to provide a set of rules and guidelines for physicians to follow to prevent the spread of disease. While efforts to ensure proper hygiene as a way to guard against illness can be traced to Mesopotamian civilization and Sanskrit writings from 2000 BCE, Nightingale’s warnings, in particular, and sanitary reform, more generally, sparked a critical turning point in the middle of the nineteenth century that gave rise to preventive medicine. This transformed military medicine from an enterprise that largely focused on treatment and surgery to one that began to engage epidemiological questions and issues.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-maladies-of-empire-jim-downs-belknap-press-153044507.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f1d7fff-3b7f-4dcc-9236-865cca0a76b7</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 15:30:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631045430</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T20:10:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/78d0cdf0-0fff-11ec-b8ea-89cb78807415" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/78d0cdf0-0fff-11ec-b8ea-89cb78807415" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How Florence Nightingale changed medicine using stats and &#39;rose charts&#39;]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla rolls out Full Self Driving 10 beta with more confident decision making]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-v9-beta-release-date-170921380.html">last big Full Self Driving beta</a> was about enabling more semi-autonomous features off the highway, its newest release is focused more on helping you trust those features. <em>Electrek</em><a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/11/tesla-pushes-mind-blowing-full-self-driving-beta-v10-early-access-fleet/">notes</a> Tesla has started rolling out a Full Self Driving 10 beta that, from early <a href="https://twitter.com/tesla_raj/status/1436624804107354117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1436624804107354117%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Felectrek.co%2F2021%2F09%2F11%2Ftesla-pushes-mind-blowing-full-self-driving-beta-v10-early-access-fleet%2F">reports</a>, appears to make smarter and more confident decisions off the highway.

In a new <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212803">Apple Support post</a> first seen by <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/10/iphone-camera-vibration-damage-motorcyles/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, the tech giant has warned that high amplitude vibrations, &quot;specifically those generated by high-power motorcycle engines&quot; transmitted through handlebars, can damage its phones&#39; cameras. As the publication notes, that damage can be permanent. A simple Google search will surface <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/594197/Will+shaking+damage+the+image+stabilization">posts</a> over the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/76ezfz/psa_motorcycle_vibration_can_damage_cell_phone/">past</a> few years by users whose cameras were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/motorcycles/comments/ht0sv3/psa_iphone_11_camera_destroyed_via_motorcycle/">ruined</a> after they mounted their iPhone on their bike, mostly so they can use it for navigation.&nbsp;</p><p>While Apple didn&#39;t say why it&#39;s issuing a warning now, it did explain the reason why attaching the iPhone to a motorcycle can destroy its camera. The company said that the camera&#39;s optical image stabilization (OIS) and closed-loop autofocus (AF) features can be damaged by long-term exposure to high-amplitude vibrations. A camera&#39;s OIS makes it possible for a device&#39;s gyroscope to sense movement. In turn, the gyroscope changes its angle and the lens moves accordingly to prevent blur when you accidentally move while taking a photo.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile with closed-loop AF, a phone&#39;s onboard magnetic sensors measure vibrations to compensate for the movement, so the lens can be positioned accurately.

That&#39;s because the social network has been giving them flawed and incomplete information on how users interact with posts and links on the website, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions#facebook-sent-flawed-data-to-misinformation-researchers"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook has been giving academics access to its data over the past couple of years to track the spread of misinformation on its platform. It promised researchers transparency and access to <em>all</em> user interaction, but the data the company has been giving them reportedly only includes interactions for about half of its users in the US. Further, most of the users whose interactions were included in the reports are the ones who engage with political posts enough to make their leanings clear.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In an email to researchers<em> The Times</em> saw, Facebook apologized for the &quot;inconvenience [it] may have caused.&quot; The company also told them that it&#39;s fixing the issue, but that it could take weeks due to the sheer volume of data it has to process. Facebook told the researchers, though, that the data they received for users outside the US isn&#39;t inaccurate.</p><p>Facebook spokesperson Mavis Jones blamed the data inaccuracy to a &quot;technical error,&quot; which the company is apparently &quot;working swiftly to resolve.&quot; As <em>The Times</em> notes, it was University of Urbino associate professor Fabio Giglietto who first discovered the inaccuracy. Giglietto compared the data handed over to researchers with the &quot;Widely Viewed Content Report&quot; the social network <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html">published</a> publicly in August and found that the results didn&#39;t match.&nbsp;</p><p>Other researchers raised concerns after that report was published. Alice Marwick, a researcher from the University of North Carolina, told <em>Engadget</em> that they couldn&#39;t verify those results, because they had no access to the data Facebook used. The company reportedly held a call with researchers on Friday to apologize. Megan Squire, one of those researchers, told<em> The Times</em>: &quot;From a human point of view, there were 47 people on that call today and every single one of those projects is at risk, and some are completely destroyed.&quot;</p><p>Some researchers have been using their own tools to gather information for their research, but in at least one instance, Facebook cut off their access. In August, Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-disables-accounts-nyu-ad-observatory-project-091040346.html">disabled</a> the accounts associated with the NYU Ad Observatory project. The team used a browser extension to collect information on political ads, but the social network said it was &quot;unauthorized scraping.&quot; At the time, Laura Edelson, the project&#39;s lead researcher, told <em>Engadget</em> that Facebook is silencing the team because its &quot;work often calls attention to problems on its platform.&quot; Edelson added: &quot;If this episode demonstrates anything it is that Facebook should not have veto power over who is allowed to study them.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-misinformation-researchers-incomplete-data-050143486.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ab041706-e7c4-4c48-836a-755b2be42eaf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 05:01:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631336557</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T05:02:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/17bbc000-f5ef-11e9-bbdf-503700a12fbc" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/17bbc000-f5ef-11e9-bbdf-503700a12fbc" width="6720" height="4480" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 23: Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in the Rayburn House Office Building on Capitol Hill October 23, 2019 in Washington, DC.

But it actually also released another sub-$100 product called <a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-2##100-91400003-40">the Elite 2</a> — we just can&#39;t buy it here in the US. The company&#39;s product page says &quot;This product is not available in your country&quot; when accessed from America.</p><p>Our senior news editor Billy Steele noticed when he was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html">reviewing the Elite 3</a> that there was a listing for what appeared to be an unannounced Elite 2 in Jabra&#39;s app. We&#39;ve since learned that the Elite 2 actually did get released, but only in countries like India, China, Russia and Turkey for now. According to the company, the Elite 2 indeed launched in &quot;select markets worldwide.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>These buds are similar to the Elite 3, keeping the same overall shape and a similar design but with small differences. There&#39;s one fewer microphone per side for calls, no ambient sound mode or sidetone and the case only holds two charges instead of three. Otherwise, the Elite 2 is basically the same as the pair we reviewed, with 6mm speakers, EQ presets, Alexa support, one-touch Spotify playback and Google&#39;s Fast Pair for those using it with Android.&nbsp;</p><p>According to <a href="https://tavesper.tech/2021/09/jabra-elite-2-malaysia/"><em>Tavesper.tech</em></a>, the Elite 2 is available in Malaysia for RM299, which is about $72. That&#39;s only about $8 cheaper than the Elite 3. Plus, prices could be different in other regions. On this <a href="https://www.macnificent.co.za/accessories/iphone-ipad-accessories/headphones/jabra-elite-2-true-wireless-in-ear-earbuds-dark-grey-detail">South African website</a>, for example, it&#39;s going for about 1,200 Rand, which is close to $85. For now, we can&#39;t directly compare prices without knowing what it could cost stateside, and just because it&#39;s not currently available in the US doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t ever come here eventually.

As a <em>Fortnite</em> player, you may wonder what it all means in terms of playing the game on an iOS device. The short answer is not much.</p><p>The long answer is neither side came away from the contest with a decisive win. Judge Gonzales Rogers may have ruled in Epic’s favor when on the issue of allowing App Store developers to direct users to alternate payment systems, but on every other count, she sided with Apple. That includes the question of whether the company was right to terminate Epic’s App Store developer account when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-fortnite-direct-payment-discounts-143422257.html">added a direct payment option</a> in <em>Fortnite </em>last year<em>.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4c977141868c457a8abef93647ef55cc"><div class="iframely-embed"><div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom:66.6667%;padding-top:120px;"><a href="https://www.engadget.com/preview-fortnite-ios-194604490.html"></a></div></div></div><p>On that matter, Judge Gonzales Rodgers said Apple’s decision was “valid, lawful and enforceable.” It’s therefore up to the company whether or not to allow the game back on the App Store. Based on the fact the tech giant rejected Epic’s request to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-fortnite-ios-korea-050658329.html"><ins>reinstate its developer license</ins></a> after South Korea <a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-law-app-store-alternative-payments-114504007.html"><ins>passed a law</ins></a> that will require both Apple and Google to allow alternative payment systems on their app stores, and the fact Epic says it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667208/epic-games-appeal-apple-judge-rogers-ruling-court"><ins>appeal the ruling</ins></a>, it’s unlikely the game will return to iOS anytime soon.</p><p>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney made that much clear following the decision. “<em>Fortnite</em> will return to the iOS App Store when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment, passing along the savings to consumers,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1436370846545809410?s=20">said</a> on Twitter.</p><p>It’s hard to put a timeline on when we might see a new development in the situation. Court cases involving tech companies can take months and sometimes years to resolve. In the meantime, <em>Fortnite</em> is still available on other platforms, including PC, PlayStation and Xbox.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-ios-195157710.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">755d3126-23d1-4c4f-82a5-57b70a409441</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 19:51:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631303520</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T19:52:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/0d595ae0-3b00-11ea-b97f-50b4929ef3cb" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/0d595ae0-3b00-11ea-b97f-50b4929ef3cb" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Savusia Konstantin via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan - July 6 2019: Fortnite app in play smartphone. close-up on screen iphone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Iphone Apps.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ikea's next Sonos speaker lamps may have swappable shades]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ikea&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-ikea-symfonisk-review.html">Symfonisk lamp</a> is a neat way to add a Sonos speaker to your space without it necessarily <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ikea-symfonisk-art-piece-speaker-204954533.html">sticking out</a> from the rest of your decor.

The company was fresh face on the market, but it included luminaries of the electronic instrument world who worked on Akai&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-live-ii-review-153032772.html">MPC</a> line and Arturia&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-flagship-poly-brute-synthesize-is-shipping-now-233639466.html">&#39;Brute</a> line. So there was understandably some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rJd_j9_Ixs">hype</a>. And consensus is that it&#39;s <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/reviews/asm-hydrasynth">lived up to it</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Now the company is taking its unique wavemorphing engine, a keybed with polyphonic aftertouch, plus its full raft of sound design tools and putting them in the portable, battery-powered and more affordable <a href="https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/hydrasynth-explorer">Hydrasynth Explorer</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Explorer has 37 semi-weighted, mid-sized keys. So it&#39;s a bit more generous than your average mainstream synthesizer. And just like it&#39;s big siblings — the $1,299 Hydrasynth and $799 Hydrasynth Desktop — it has eight voices of polyphony and three oscillators. It also has two &quot;mutators&quot; which can mangle oscillators one and two in various ways from pretty standard (FM and pulse width modulation) to more out there (PhazDiff and harmonic sweep).</p><div id="ea5282f44bc64eb59ac11dc90d892ffb"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uoUj_IBd_OM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>There&#39;s also two filters that can be combined in series or parallel and five — yes <em>five</em> — LFOs and envelope generators. And those envelope generators aren&#39;t your standard ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release) envelopes either. These are six-stage DAHDSR envelopes (delay, attack, hold, decay, sustain, release). There&#39;s also built-in delay and reverb effects, a 32-slot modulation matrix and a pretty advanced arpeggiator.&nbsp;</p><p>All of that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HxId3Yw4Y0">sound design power</a> comes in an instrument that can be powered by eight AA batteries and costs just $600. Granted at 7.5 pounds it&#39;s definitely pushing the boundaries of &quot;portable&quot;. You&#39;re definitely not going to lug the Hydrasynth Explorer on your commute,  but it&#39;s not too much of a hassle to drag it to an impromptu jam session or <a href="https://youtu.be/uCNYT0O54Zc">set up in a park</a> for an afternoon.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside the Explorer, ASM also announced the <a href="https://www.ashunsoundmachines.com/hydrasynth-deluxe">Hydrasynth Deluxe</a> which has 73 full-sized keys and bumps the voice count up to 16. Of course, it also comes at a premium with a price of $1,799.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asm-hydrasynth-explorer-superbooth-wavemorphing-portable-191358134.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc3ebc36-66a1-427e-af5a-0b7b4f01b562</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 19:13:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631300873</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T19:07:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63672130-1266-11ec-afff-b14a7d0fc319" width="1225" height="645" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63672130-1266-11ec-afff-b14a7d0fc319" width="1225" height="645" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ASM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASM Hydrasynth Explorer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASM Hydrasynth Explorer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch sues two 'hate raiders' linked to automated harassment campaigns]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For much of the last month and a half, Twitch has fought a losing battle against a phenomenon called “hate raids.” These attacks see malicious individuals use an army of bots to spam a streamer’s chat with hateful language, and almost always they target creators from marginalized communities. This week, Twitch <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/524416914/Twitch-Interactive-vs-Cruzzcontrol-and-CreatineOverdose">filed a suit</a> against some of those involved in the harassment campaigns.</p><p>The legal action comes after a variety of Twitch streamers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamers-are-taking-a-day-off-next-week-to-protest-hate-raids-065515266.html">stepped away from the platform</a> on September 1st in protest of the company’s ineffective handling of the situation. The suit, first spotted by <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/twitch-sues-users-over-alleged-hate-raids/"><em>Wired</em></a>, only names two defendants: CruzzControl and CreatineOverdose. Twitch does not identify the two individuals beyond their usernames but notes it believes they’re both based out of Europe.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In the complaint, Twitch alleges CruzzControl is responsible for a network of approximately 3,000 bots that have been involved in hate raids against streamers in the Black and LGBTQIA+ communities. In addition to overwhelming those channels with racist, homophobic and sexist spam, the company says CruzzControl has shown how the bots work so that others can deploy them toward a similar end.

They&#39;re seeking an injunction to stop the city enforcing the fee limits as well as damages and a jury trial. “Left unchecked, the ordinance sets a dangerous precedent,” they argued.</p><p>Councilman Mark Gjonaj, chair of the city’s Small Business Committee, said that NYC would maintain the caps and proceed with other oversight over delivery apps. “The laws simply seek to bring fairness to a system that all too often lacks it,” he told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grubhub-doordash-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-over-fee-caps-11631237227"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>.

Well, almost nothing. I was an IT help desk drone during the day, but my nights and weekends were almost entirely filled learning the intricacies of the game&#39;s rail gun, rocket jump maneuvers, and inventive mods (if I ruined your day in a Threewave match, <em>sorry</em>). Now that I have a child, a home to take care of, and an endless list of adult responsibilities, I thought I had put all that behind me. Then I started playing <em>Splitgate</em>.</p><p>At first, it seems to be a fairly standard free-to-play multiplayer shooter, like a lost <em>Halo </em>clone from a decade ago. But the twist is that it also brings in the core mechanic from <em>Portal</em>. Alongside your normal weaponry, you also have a gun that can create portals on specific areas, no matter how far apart they are. And it&#39;s not just for teleporting, either. You can also peer through those portals to pick off far-away enemies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8aaaf8f9971e4ffd87c3a232eb1afec0"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5XKcTM_NM8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>That may seem like a small, even quaint, addition to the world of 4v4 online shooters. But in practice it fundamentally changes how they work. Being able to strategically use portals is just as important as being a crack shot who&#39;s memorized every map. And of course, it goes the other way too. If you can sneak up on an enemy with portals, they can do the same to you. Nowhere is safe.</p><p><em>Splitgate&#39;s</em> subtle complexity is what makes it addictive. All of a sudden, walls high up on the map could give you a vantage point to snipe oblivious foes. A chase through a corridor could easily get wild as you jump between multiple portals. And being able to sneak up on a camping sniper by throwing a portal behind them is always satisfying.</p><p>I&#39;ve gotten into plenty of shooters over the years, but they&#39;ve never quite scratched my <em>Quake 3</em> itch (perhaps because I never again had vast amounts of free time to eat pizza and play all day). Battle Royale titles like <em>PUBG</em> and <em>Apex Legend</em> changed the landscape with enormous maps with 100 players, but they&#39;ve always felt more like tense survival games than huge fragfests. They take longer to play, and one screw-up could take you out of a match entirely. I didn&#39;t know how much I missed the days of simple multiplayer shooters, games with quick matches that deliver a direct dose of adrenaline and dopamine all at once, until I started playing <em>Splitgate</em>.</p><p>Even though it&#39;s become wildly popular over the last few months, <em>Splitgate</em> hasn&#39;t officially launched yet. Still, its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-season-0-beta-launch-193849912.html">most recent beta release, Season 0</a>, has added a lot on consoles and PCs. That includes new character models, more maps and an infection gameplay mode. I&#39;ve been playing earlier betas for the last few months, but now it&#39;s finally starting to look like a complete product, with more UI polish and player models I don&#39;t entirely hate. It&#39;s also the perfect time to give it a shot before elite players make online matches less enjoyable to play.</p><section data-eng-breakout="801acae1f8144a258989792b6e4bec74" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8a361700-125a-11ec-9e7b-5982e5dc0dbd" alt="Splitgate"></section><p>Since it&#39;s a free-to-play game, <em>Splitgate</em> developer 1047 Games is following in the footsteps of modern shooters by making you pay for items, characters and Battle Passes to level yourself up. It&#39;s all cosmetic, but I&#39;ve found myself throwing them a few bucks for holographic armor and other trinkets just because I enjoy playing the game so much. Spending $20 in add-ons doesn&#39;t seem that bad for something that’s already given me dozens of hours of joy.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8a31f850-125a-11ec-beb7-19fa6c35d419" alt="Splitgate" data-uuid="301a833a-03d9-3378-abd3-e941d3275dc1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">1047 Games</div></figure><p>If you’re considering jumping into <em>Splitgate</em>, I have one piece of advice: Learn to love the damn portals. Treating it like a normal run-and-gun FPS is a recipe for failure, no matter how great you are. It’s a game about quick movement across the map, sneaky shots through your portals, and sneaking up on your enemies. It’s not for everyone, but for players who find joy in a five-minute, fast-paced team deathmatch mode, it’s practically perfect.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-portal-fps-gaming-irl-quake-3-180032280.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">be3da6c3-d2b0-45bd-9139-d0542a47c106</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 18:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631300280</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T18:58:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8a329490-125a-11ec-bff3-3f4c5d0bc42f" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8a329490-125a-11ec-bff3-3f4c5d0bc42f" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[1047 Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Splitgate]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Splitgate]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sonos is raising prices on almost all of its products]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sonos makes some excellent connected speakers and home theater products, but no one ever said they were cheap. As of this Sunday, September 12th, they&#39;ll cost even more here in the US.

The One SL (which is the same as the One, but without mics for voice assistants) now costs $199 rather than $179. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-roam-review-130039811.html">new Sonos Roam</a> portable speaker is getting a $10 price bump, to $179.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The flagship Sonos Five audio speaker will now cost $549 instead of $499, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html">flagship Arc soundbar </a>costs $899, a full $100 more expensive than before. The Sub, which is primarily geared towards home theater but can also be used with music speakers, is up $50 to $749. The only speaker that isn&#39;t going to cost more is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-sonos-move-review.html">the Move</a>, which is staying at $399. Sonos didn&#39;t mention any changes to the Beam in its price list, either.</p><p>Sonos first announced that it would increase prices <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/672173472/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/FINAL-SONO-3Q21-Conference-Call-Transcript.pdf">on its quarterly earnings call</a> back in early August, but didn&#39;t provide details at the time. As for why now, the company gave some unsurprisingly vague details around &quot;assessing market dynamics&quot; to achieve growth goals and maintain innovation across its entire portfolio, including software and services as well as hardware. Obviously, no customer wants to see price increases, but given that Sonos solid the $199 Play:1 and then the One, its successor, at that price point for the better part of a decade, a 10 percent increase isn&#39;t too crazy. Given how new the Arc is, though, a $100 bump on an already expensive product might limit its broader market appeal a little. Though on the other hand, most home theater aficionados are probably used to opening their wallets for good hardware.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonos-raising-prices-september-12-174153206.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e13d80e0-2292-446b-8dd0-634097a138a2</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 17:41:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631307719</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T21:02:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c68b9390-125c-11ec-b5fe-c81e2f8eacbf" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c68b9390-125c-11ec-b5fe-c81e2f8eacbf" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sonos is raising prices on almost all of its products]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Don’t sleep on the iPhone mini]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, Apple revealed more new iPhones than ever.

We’ve covered the ups and downs of tiny smartphones <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-03-will-2018-be-the-year-small-phones-die.html">over the last few years</a>, so it was a surprise — but a welcome one — when Apple decided to cater to this niche. Working in Apple’s favor, smartphone makers weren’t making small phones anymore (barring, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-compact-leak-190015885.html">perhaps</a>, Sony).&nbsp;</p><p>So when we finally got the iPhone 12 mini in our hands, what did we think? Chris Velazco, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-mini-review-cameras-battery-life-002700754.html">who reviewed it</a>, said it was, pretty much, an iPhone 12, but smaller. He added that while it was the most potent small phone he’d tested in years, it dodged the problems of typing on smaller screens, because the display stretched to the edges of the 12 mini’s body.&nbsp;</p><p>The iPhone SE, by comparison, had to make space for the home button at the bottom and the camera and earpiece at the top, which was a tight squeeze for thumbs on a 4.7-inch screen. (The iPhone 12 mini is physically a smaller phone than the iPhone SE.)</p><p>About half a year ago, I switched from my iPhone 12 Pro Max to the iPhone 12 mini. Despite how excited I was about the smallest new iPhone at launch, I still wanted the 12 Pro Max as my main phone. I told myself I needed the cameras.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6e5fc05c2a4145b98dd8454564992cfb" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c7218ba0-1254-11ec-bb42-2e0142c5aab4" alt="iPhone mini 12"></section><p>I had a few reasons for “downgrading” to the iPhone 12 mini. The pandemic had tricked me into beginning a jogging habit. The hulking iPhone 12 Pro Max was not made for running shorts, and I couldn’t use my Apple Watch as it didn’t offer the narrative features of the Couch24K app.&nbsp;</p><p>So there was the iPhone mini, provided by Apple when the four phones were first introduced. Small, powerful enough, and I didn’t need high-res pics because I wasn’t going anywhere during London’s lockdown. Also, the iPhone mini’s cameras are fine — good even.&nbsp;</p><p>One issue with the iPhone mini is that its smallest (cheapest) configuration comes with only 64GB of storage. But, honestly, I don’t use much on-device storage, so it wasn’t hard to migrate everything.</p><p>It’s a nice feeling to be able to fit more than just your phone into your pocket; not to awkwardly stretch your thumb to reach the top of the screen. The iPhone mini is wonderful to use one-handed most of the time.&nbsp;</p><p>For roughly six months, the iPhone mini was the perfect petite device for me. My Apple Arcade favorites, including relatively processor-intensive games like Fantasian, ran without issue, and my other daily apps never suffered a hiccup. I could use Fitness+ and while you might think video streaming would be less compelling on a smaller screen, I was mostly in my home. I have a TV!&nbsp;</p><p>It wasn’t all perfect, though, and the major issue was exactly what our review pointed to; meager battery life. Perhaps because the iPhone 12 mini matched the bigger iPhone 12 in all specifications barring screen size, there is a physical limit to <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+12+mini+Teardown/138505">how big the battery can be</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn’t notice that during the first half-year, but that’s probably because I was, well, mostly trapped indoors. Any time the battery dipped below 50 percent, I was immediately near a power output and could easily top the iPhone mini back up to full power.&nbsp;</p><p>When the country started opening up again, I went out more. And I wasn’t taking battery packs or charging cables with me. A few times, I cut it real close getting back home (or to a power outlet) before the battery reached single-digit percentages. After too many close calls, the pin went in, the SIM came out, and I left the iPhone 12 mini for the much bigger model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When stories of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-mini-production-report-172806780.html">slashed iPhone mini 12 production</a> started appearing, I feared that this was a short-lived Apple experiment that had run its course. However, the latest rumors suggest otherwise. Last week, a listing at the FCC suggested that Apple was testing four new devices with its latest MagSafe technology. That should be the Pro Max, the Pro, the base model and the mini.</p><p>Other reports suggest that the next series of iPhones, whether they’re called iPhone 13 or something else, will offer some subtle changes improvements to last year’s models. Crucially, one report from March suggests that batteries across the iPhone series <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-ming-chi-quo-174922962.html">will be bigger</a>, while more energy-efficient components, from chipsets through to screens, should also improve battery longevity.&nbsp;</p><p>Many phone buyers might have been skeptical that a smaller iPhone — even if new — would be as capable as bigger models. In the evolution story of smartphones, bigger screens always game with better specifications. The iPhone 12 mini was an anomaly, and maybe we weren’t ready to it.&nbsp;</p><p>If Apple can make the iPhone mini go the distance, battery-wise, but keep the specifications on par with the bigger model, there wouldn’t be much left for me (or phone reviewers) to complain about. September 14th is pretty soon. Bring it on, Apple.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/i-loved-the-iphone-12-mini-173037929.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a2bc81a5-1d08-4d03-924e-8e791a3ab5ee</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 17:30:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631309597</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T21:33:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c71f41b0-1254-11ec-aff5-4aeb0bd3a774" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c71f41b0-1254-11ec-aff5-4aeb0bd3a774" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget, Chris Velasco]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone mini 12]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone mini 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vimeo is ready to host Dolby Vision videos shot on iPhone 12 Pro]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Apple announced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-12-pro-max-175129027.html">iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max</a> last fall, the company talked up the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-hdr-video-and-proraw-181421701.html">HDR capabilities</a> of its new phones.

The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-date-161123048.html">sent out invites earlier this week</a> that featured the words “California Streaming,” which of course led many of us in the industry to speculate like crazy what surprises might be in store. My money is on new TV+ or Apple Music content, while <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/news/apples-californian-streaming-invite-means-3808212/">others are guessing</a> game streaming or a cloud-based macOS might be possible. But as always, we already have a good idea of what to expect thanks to analysts, leakers and FCC filings. Here’s a selection of the more-credible leaks that have been swirling around so you can catch up on all the iPhone 13 rumors ahead of the September 14th keynote.</p><h2>iPhone 13</h2><p>Just as there were four <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">iPhone 12 models</a> last year, we’re expecting the same number of iPhone 13s next week. This was pretty much confirmed by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-references-new-iphone-models-magsafe-fcc-filing-100602419.html">an FCC filing about upcoming MagSafe updates</a>, which didn’t name them but referred to four “New Phone” items in addition to the existing generation. Those four devices are most likely the iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, and I’m personally glad Apple is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/i-loved-the-iphone-12-mini-173037929.html">keeping the baby iPhone around</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqOujNnuHBg">early as February this year</a>, rumors of the new iPhones featuring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-2021-always-on-display-223000663.html">Always On displays</a> have been floating and have only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-12s-always-on-display-leak-164539339.html">gained</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-2021-gurman-portrait-mode-pro-res-always-on-display-bloomberg-122438020.html">traction</a> since. This would allow Apple to constantly have the time and other system indicators appear on your lock screen. Another popular rumor suggests the next iPhones will have smaller notches, and that a 120Hz screen is coming to the Pro model. If that’s true, Apple would be catching up to Samsung, though Google still hasn’t hit that high of a refresh rate on its flagships yet.</p><p>With the potential Always On display and faster refresh rates, battery life could be a concern for the new flagships. But it sounds like Apple might be mitigating that by using lower power LTPO (or Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) screens and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-ming-chi-quo-174922962.html">bigger batteries</a>. There’s also talk of an in-display fingerprint reader coming to the iPhone 13 line, though the reports on that are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-ming-chi-quo-174922962.html">less consistent</a>. It’d also be weird since the main iPhone series, haven’t had a Touch ID sensor since the iPhone X was launched in 2017.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5c008eb0-11a1-11ec-b65f-4889bf86ab53" alt="A person holding a blue iPhone 12 and blue iPhone 12 pro in each hand, with the devices&#39; rear cameras facing up. " data-uuid="606c6858-08af-3736-8b35-b86f69c0e207"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chris Velazco / Engadget</div></figure><p>Beyond their screens, the iPhones are also expected to get some camera upgrades. On the hardware front, we’re reportedly getting improved ultra-wide cameras across the lineup, with better sensors and lenses. As for imaging software, Apple is supposedly adding an automatic astrophotography feature and a portrait video mode that could blur out the background while you film. Samsung already offers this on its S21 series, so it’ll be interesting to see how the two compare.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-leo-satellite-communication-165409961.html">surprising recent rumor</a> suggests the iPhone 13 might even support satellite communications, which could let you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-satellite-limited-coverage-152109533.html">make emergency calls</a> if you’re out of a typical cellular coverage area. This would be a unique feature in modern smartphones, and almost hard to believe. But the report said Apple would be using a modified Qualcomm radio to enable this, meaning the components could already be easily available, making it more possible this is coming this year.</p><p>Externally, the phones aren’t expected to look significantly different from their predecessors, other than a potentially “gripper” texture on their backs. Reports seem to agree that the lightning port will remain, and that the updated MagSafe charger (and the phones) will have stronger magnets to prevent accidental slippage.</p><p>Finally, as we’ve been referring to it throughout this article, the next generation is most likely going to be called the iPhone 13. Not the iPhone 12S or the iPhone 14, because apparently Apple is not superstitious. Which is cool. Courage.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/c08e3a08-ffa3-11ea-bf77-b49031e887f5" alt="Apple Watch SE review" data-uuid="af816bcb-cf73-3f64-bf82-be4c3b72a0fb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Watch Series 7</h2><p>In addition to new phones, it’s also quite likely that we’ll see new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-review-watchos-7-price-specs-comparison-172542713.html">Apple Watches</a> next week. Specifically, we’re expecting the company to unveil the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-larger-screen-sizes-213316597.html">Watch Series 7 with larger cases and screens</a>.</p><p>Some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">reports suggest</a> the new wearables will also sport thinner bezels, a flatter design, a faster chip and updated “ultra-wideband functionality,” which might improve its communication with doors, locks and other devices. And that’s about all we’ve heard so far.</p><p>According to various sources, anticipated features like a body-temperature sensor or blood sugar monitor won’t be ready for this year’s Watch. Those waiting for a rugged variant will also probably have to wait till 2022 at least.</p><h2>AirPods 3</h2><p>Speaking of waiting, we’re coming up on about two and a half years since Apple launched the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-03-apple-airpods-review-2019-more-of-the-same.html">AirPods 2nd gen in 2019</a>. It took about the same amount of time for the company to introduce the follow-up to its original wireless earbuds, though, so it’s very likely we’ll see the next generation come September 14th.</p><p>At some point, rumors suggested they might arrive earlier this year. We’re now well into the 2nd half of 2021, and all we’ve seen of the third-generation AirPods is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-generation-leak-205121774.html">photo leaked in February</a>. The image is purportedly of the regular model, not the Pro, and includes the device’s carrying case. The holder appears wider than the second gen’s and the buds seem to have an in-ear design similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">the AirPods Pro</a>. That fits with other rumors swirling around.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1594cc10-11a2-11ec-bfbb-a120cbd8efe3" alt="Two white wireless earbuds on top of a white charging case. Image is covered with a translucent watermark with Chinese characters and the url " data-uuid="2e8df32d-61e6-394e-a806-720d74ce6751"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">52Audio</div></figure><p>Beyond what can be seen in the picture, the source <em>52Audio </em>also claimed that the third-gen AirPods would support active noise cancellation and spatial audio. That contradicts an earlier Bloomberg report that said those features wouldn’t make it. The Bloomberg story did say the AirPods would offer a new chip and longer battery life, though.</p><h2>iPad 9, iPad mini 6, MacBook Pro and more</h2><p>Those three product lines seem all but guaranteed to show up at next week’s launch, but let’s not forget about the iPad. Apple’s next entry-level tablet <em>should </em>be the iPad 9 and multiple reports from sources like <em>Digitimes </em>and <em>Bloomberg’s </em>Mark Gurman suggest that it’ll arrive this month alongside the iPhones. An iPad mini 6 is also supposedly on the horizon.</p><p>In general, rumors indicate that <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/ipad-9">the iPad 9</a> is going to look quite similar to its predecessor, with a somewhat thinner design and slightly bigger screen. The more noteworthy upgrades are likely to be internal, with faster chips and more RAM being a popular speculation. If Apple does launch a new tablet next week, these incremental improvements do seem like a given. It’s also possible that the iPad 9 may offer MagSafe support, though since a slate wasn’t mentioned in the FCC filing I mentioned earlier, this seems unlikely.</p><p>As for <a href="https://www.imore.com/ipad-mini-6-2021">the iPad mini 6</a>, it appears as if a redesign might be in the works that would make the compact tablet look more like the M1 iPad Pro, with thinner bezels and a squarer design. It could also come with a USB-C port instead of Lightning, as well as a potential Smart Connector for keyboards and other accessories.</p><p>That’s a whole smorgasbord of Apple devices that might be unveiled next week, as the company readies new products for the upcoming holiday shopping season. But there could still be more surprises up its sleeve. Though a new Apple TV was already launched earlier this year, based on the words California Streaming on the invitation, we’ll probably hear about new shows coming to TV+. Plus, <em>Bloomberg’s </em>Gurman also wrote in a newsletter that he’s expecting a redesigned MacBook Pro between September and November this year, which means it could be announced alongside the iPhones. Or maybe Apple is saving that for another event later in the year.</p><p>Whatever you might be most interested to see come September 14th, it’s clear Apple has plenty to show off. We’ll be hosting a live show on the Engadget YouTube channel when the event is over, so that we can all be disappointed or excited together with you in real time. I hope you’ll come hang with me and UK Bureau Chief Mat Smith and have some fun then!</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-apple-iphone-13-rumors-leaks-california-streaming-event-160034910.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">676df74a-c1d6-4742-926e-fe94f1e76bc5</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 16:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631321496</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T00:51:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/3a6d83e7-1fa6-11eb-afd7-07d1f2bc4163" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/3a6d83e7-1fa6-11eb-afd7-07d1f2bc4163" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 12 Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 12 Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Judge issues permanent injunction on App Store model in Epic v. Apple case]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The judge in the case between <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple">Apple</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epic%20games">Epic Games</a> has <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/524421061/Epic-Games-Inc-v-Apple-Inc-Candce-20-05640-0814-0">issued a permanent injunction</a> against Apple. The company must allow App Store developers to direct users to other payment systems, which would let them bypass the 30 percent cut of in-app payments that Apple takes.&nbsp;</p><p>Judge Gonzales Rogers ruled in Epic&#39;s favor on one count, per <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/524421061/Epic-Games-Inc-v-Apple-Inc-Candce-20-05640-0814-0">court documents</a> posted by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/10/epic-vs-apple-ruling-revealed-apple-must-allow-app-store-devs-to-redirect-users-to-other-payment-systems/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a>. She determined that Apple violated California&#39;s Unfair Competition law, leading to the injunction, which is set to take effect in 90 days.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the injunction, Apple is &quot;permanently restrained and enjoined&quot; from preventing developers to include in their apps and metadata &quot;buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing.&quot; Apple also may not stop developers from &quot;communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.&quot;</p><p>On every other count, Judge Gonzales Rogers ruled in Apple&#39;s favor, determining, among other things, that the App Store doesn&#39;t violate antitrust law. She also ruled against Epic in Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/524422113/Epic-Games-Inc-v-Apple-Inc-Candce-20-05640-0812-0-2">counterclaim</a> for breach of contract. As such, Epic must pay Apple $3.65 million. That&#39;s equivalent to 30 percent of the $12.2 million Epic earned from <em>Fortnite </em>iOS players between August and October 2020 through the Epic Direct Payment system. Epic also has to pay Apple 30 percent of the revenue it received via that system between November 1st and today.</p><p>“Today the Court has affirmed what we’ve known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law. As the Court recognized ‘success is not illegal.&#39;&quot; Apple said in a statement. &quot;Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world. We remain committed to ensuring the App Store is a safe and trusted marketplace that supports a thriving developer community and more than 2.1 million U.S. jobs, and where the rules apply equally to everyone.”</p><div id="6beb41e29b9f44cf96f00f65f6eb7556"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite will return to the iOS App Store when and where Epic can offer in-app payment in fair competition with Apple in-app payment, passing along the savings to consumers.</p>— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1436370846545809410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>&quot;Today’s ruling isn&#39;t a win for developers or for consumers.

The former kicked off the legal fight in August 2020, when it informed <em>Fortnite </em>players on iOS and Android that they would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-fortnite-direct-payment-discounts-143422257.html">receive a discount</a> on in-game goods if they bypassed Apple and Google&#39;s payment systems.
