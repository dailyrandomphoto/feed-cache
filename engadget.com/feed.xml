The company has unveiled an LZ2000 line that focuses on areas some of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-g2-c2-annoucement-020045964.html">its rivals</a> might overlook. Gamers get special attention through reduced lag at 60Hz, HDMI 2.1 support, automatic detection of NVIDIA GPUs and a Game Control Board overlay to help you adjust common settings like the viewing mode and HDR tone mapping. These aren&#39;t the only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2022-qled-microled-8k-4k-tv-020046596.html">gaming-friendly TVs</a> debuting in 2022, but they may be particularly useful if you rarely play beyond 60Hz or frequently connect to a PC.</p><p>There are some broader audiovisual upgrades. The 4K-capable LZ2000 is now available in a 77-inch size in addition to the earlier 55- and 65-inch variants, and sensors now measure the ambient light temperature to produce more natural tones. Improved processing also improves &quot;mid-level&quot; brightness for well-lit living rooms, and is better at detecting content types like sports. Revamped Dolby Atmos speakers provide clearer audio, a wider sound stage and directional sound that can aim at specific points or areas. You might watch a movie at night without waking your kids, for example.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Prices will be available closer to the LZ2000&#39;s release date sometime in summer 2022. The TV isn&#39;t going to make larger rivals nervous, but that doesn&#39;t appear to be the goal —Panasonic seems happy to serve those frustrated with mainstream options.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-lz2000-oled-tv-164727576.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1a9f44a-2503-4870-93b8-78a1b2972041</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:47:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641314853</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T16:47:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a9ce9040-6d79-11ec-95fe-6acd8979ca9d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a9ce9040-6d79-11ec-95fe-6acd8979ca9d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Panasonic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Panasonic LZ2000 OLED TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Panasonic LZ2000 OLED TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The RTX 3090 Ti is NVIDIA’s new-new flagship GPU]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At its CES press conference today, NVIDIA teased a new flagship GPU: the RTX 3090 Ti. It says more details will arrive soon, but handed out a few specs to tide its fans over until then.</p><p>As a refresher, NVIDIA currently has the RTX 3090 at the top of its stack, with the RTX 3080 Ti close behind and the RTX 3080 as the mainstream flagship. All three are based on the same GA102 chip, with the number of active cores, clock speeds and memory configurations being the key differentiators. The RTX 3090 Ti will usurp the 3090 as the ultra high-end GPU outside of its creator line.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like the 3090, the 3090 Ti will have 24GB of GDDR6X memory, except it’ll be running at 21Gbit/s, as opposed to the 19.5Gbit/s of the 3090’s memory. NVIDIA also says the GPU is capable of calculating 40 shader teraflops, 78 RT teraflops and 320 tensor (AI) teraflops That compares to the 3090’s 35.6 shader teraflops, 69.5 RT teraflops and 285 tensor teraflops.</p><div id="564419c3c4554c518bbe350e368d2adb"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KoscQVKpAQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Those figures represent a 12.5-ish percent increase over the 3090 across the board, and will likely make the 3090 Ti the most powerful gaming card ever released. We won’t know exactly how NVIDIA has achieved this until it shares full specs, but we can make some educated guesses.&nbsp;</p><p>The 3090 only has 82 out of the GA102’s 84 streaming multiprocessors activated, so it’s likely the 3090 Ti has all 84 running. Then, in addition to the memory clocks being a little faster, it’s likely NVIDIA has elevated the main GPU clock speeds slightly. Some napkin math suggests the boost clock will need to be at around 1,850MHz on the 3090 Ti (compared to 1,695MHz on the 3090) to reach the 40-teraflop figure NVIDIA has provided.</p><p>NVIDIA says “more details will be coming later this month,” so we’d expect a small event focused on the 3090 Ti to be announced soon, where we’ll find out how exorbitantly priced the 3090 Ti will be – remember that the 3090 itself has an RRP of $1,500 – and when people will theoretically be able to buy one.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/be1a0720-6d54-11ec-b6af-4040f1ed10c1" alt="NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050" data-uuid="1e398651-4a69-3856-bddb-ba4f8bf5158b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div></figure><p>Also announced at CES is the RTX 3050, which is set to become the cheapest 30-series desktop GPU to date. NVIDIA hasn’t given us full specifications on this one either, but it has 8GB of GDDR6 memory, and will be able to calculate 9 shader teraflops, 18 RT teraflops and 73 tensor teraflops. NVIDIA says it’ll be able to power “the latest ray-traced games at over 60 frames per second,” which is probably true if factoring in the company’s DLSS upscaling tech.</p><p>As is usually the case with lower-end cards, there won’t be a “founders” edition sold directly by NVIDIA, but the RTX 3050 will go on sale through the company’s various hardware partners on January 27th, with an RRP of $250.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-ces-announcement-163653863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8be15ff1-654b-4fb9-8724-880139873337</guid><dc:creator>Aaron Souppouris</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:36:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641314216</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T16:37:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Aaron Souppouris]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/61bde550-6d7c-11ec-8fff-acb5ce06b0b8" width="1515" height="912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/61bde550-6d7c-11ec-8fff-acb5ce06b0b8" width="1515" height="912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 Ti]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NVIDIA is bringing RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti GPUs to laptops]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Companies like Razer, Alienware and Asus ROG have been offering laptops with RTX 3080 and 3070 GPUs inside for a while now, but over the summer NVIDIA launched a pair of upgraded desktop cards: the 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti. Now, the company is bringing the “Ti” brand over to laptops.</p><p>The 3080 Ti will be available in laptops priced $2,499 and above. NVIDIA says it’s faster than last generation’s Titan RTX desktop card, and will be able to play (unspecified) games with 1440p ultra settings at over 120 fps. It also features 16GB of GDDR6 clocked at “the fastest ever seen in a laptop.” Exact details beyond that haven’t been shared yet, but the first 3080 Ti laptops will be available in February, so we won’t have long till we find out exactly what they’re capable of.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d29d76f0-6d7c-11ec-b7ef-0c9509ed929b" style="height:708;width:1267;" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti laptop slide" data-uuid="0d255ef9-2d16-39d5-9567-d954026b6845"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div></figure><p>The 3070 Ti will be available in laptops priced $1,499 and above. NVIDIA says this one is “70 percent faster than the RTX 2070 Super laptops,” which isn’t a particularly helpful figure but hey-ho. It’ll apparently be able to run 1440p games at ultra settings at 100 fps, and, again, will start appearing in laptops in February.</p><p>Finally, NVIDIA announced some new technologies for Max-Q laptops, including an AI CPU Optimizer which can control the frequencies and power draw of certain Intel and AMD &quot;next-gen&quot; CPUs, Rapid Core Scaling which can turn off some GPU cores while boosting the frequencies of others for productivity tasks, and Battery Boost 2.0, which will tune both your game and your hardware to apparently improve gaming while on battery. NVIDIA claims that last one can increase your battery life by 70-percent, presumably at the expense of in-game performance.and fidelity.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e2c58310-6d7c-11ec-bf77-40dfa27b15d6" style="height:714;width:1272;" alt="NVIDIA RTX 3070 Ti laptop slide" data-uuid="3b4362a3-d8e0-3b53-8896-77fc29b2a8a3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div></figure><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3070-ti-3080-ti-laptop-gpu-ces-announcement-163355552.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bbfc4ef8-784a-4b76-b2ce-1c3c1cc77dcd</guid><dc:creator>Aaron Souppouris</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:33:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641314401</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T16:42:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Aaron Souppouris]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4b960260-6d56-11ec-8e9f-924bd51c4f26" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4b960260-6d56-11ec-8e9f-924bd51c4f26" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[RTX Ti laptop launch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[RTX Ti laptop launch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NVIDIA plans to make 1440p/360Hz the new esports standard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For basically the entire modern history of esports, 1080p has been the sweet spot for competitive gaming. The wisdom goes that a 1920 x 1080 pixel grid gives enough clarity to follow all of the gameplay, while also being light enough that the GPU can process hundreds of frames per second, giving a competitive advantage (or, at least, leveling the playing field).</p><p>GPUs today have outgrown 1080p in a big way, though, with flagship cards being able to pump out framerates way above the peak of monitor refresh rates in certain titles. <em>Valorant</em>, for example, can be played at High settings well in excess of 500 fps on NVIDIA’s latest and greatest, while older titles like <em>CS:GO</em> hit over 700 fps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>NVIDIA says that an RTX 3080 paired with an Intel i9-12900K can play <em>Valorant</em>, <em>CS:GO</em>, <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Rainbow Six Seige </em>in excess of 360 fps at 1440p. With that in mind, the company thinks the time is right for the leap beyond 1080p.</p><div id="07f3936c478c414d8bc0f4c1d9f8123f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6KoscQVKpAQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Obviously NVIDIA is motivated by the need to convince gamers to buy expensive GPUs, but apparently there’s a competitive benefit to playing at higher resolution. NVIDIA&#39;s own researchers found that a 27-inch 1440p display can improve aiming “by up to 3 percent” over the 24-inch 1080p sets used by current pros.</p><p>This new “1440p esports category” begins with four NVIDIA-certified displays: the ASUS ROG Swift 360Hz PG27AQN, the AOC AG274QGM - AGON PRO Mini LED, the MSI MEG 271Q Mini LED and the ViewSonic XG272G-2K Mini LED. The ASUS set is a 360Hz monitor, while the others feature Mini LED backlights but cap out at 300Hz.</p><p>All four monitors support G-Sync adaptive refresh rates, an “Esports Vibrance” color mode and, more importantly for the target audience, support NVIDIA’s Reflex latency analyzer. Intriguingly, the new monitors also come with a “1080p mode,” which blanks out the outer edges of the screen to provide a 25-inch 1080p “display” for gaming. There must be some clever scaling going on here, as a 1:1 1080p rendering on a 27-inch 1440p monitor would be a 21-ish inch image. Either way, this mode would be vital for some games – newer esports titles can be more graphically intense than the stalwarts, and playing at 1440p could sacrifice the sort of refresh rates esports pros want for competitive play.</p><p>There’s no word on pricing yet, although don’t expect them to be remotely affordable for the average gamer. As for when they’ll be available, NVIDIA has only given out the vague “soon.”</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-reflex-1440p-360hz-gaming-monitor-1080p-mode-162014715.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3b1afbeb-faa9-4e9d-a86c-03e116474e19</guid><dc:creator>Aaron Souppouris</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:20:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641313217</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T16:20:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Aaron Souppouris]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ffe03580-6d5e-11ec-b2f7-8e24b727143c" width="3024" height="2016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ffe03580-6d5e-11ec-b2f7-8e24b727143c" width="3024" height="2016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aly Song / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Esports - The International Dota 2 World Championships - Mercedes-Benz Arena, Shanghai, China - August 25, 2019.

Now, half a year later, the company is launching a credit card-shaped tracker designed to give your wallet a similar level of protection.</p><p>The Chipolo Card Spot (sorry, we’re not going to call it the CARD Spot) can be paired to the Find My network with your iOS device. You’ll be able to track it should you leave it behind, and also get the option of notifications if you’ve left it behind when you’re out and about. Chipolo adds that the integral speaker will chirrip at 105dB to ensure that you’ll be able to hear it when you lose it. And that it’ll also withstand water, should you have a mishap during a fishing trip.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If there’s one downside, it’s that the battery isn’t replaceable, so once the two-year claimed lifespan is up, you’ll need to buy a new one. Chipolo does, however, say that you’ll get a 50 percent discount on the replacement and get a pre-paid envelope to return the expired unit. Oh, and you’ll be able to set it into Lost Mode, so when someone in the Find My network passes by, it’ll hopefully ensure your stuff gets returned to you.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/821445a0-698b-11ec-8fdc-45f0277c51a9" alt="Image of the new Chipolo Card Spot, which connects to Apple&#39;s Find My Network." data-uuid="4ec0689e-72a7-35d3-88b1-82d41af74398"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chipolo</div></figure><p>Certainly, a credit card-shaped tracker is going to be invaluable for those folks who want to leverage Apple’s most recent innovation. There are a number of aftermarket AirTag holders that will enable it to slide (slightly awkwardly, mind) into a credit card slot, and now we’re seeing more wallets with space for an AirTag hanging off the side. But all of those are designed to accommodate the slightly impractical nature of that round design.</p><p>Chipolo says that <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:pre-orders" href="https://fave.co/3306M39">pre-orders</a> for the Card Spot will open from today, with shipping expected to begin next month.

The ultra-wide panel mates the ultra-high contrast ratio of OLED with the improved brightness, color range and uniformity of a quantum dot pixel layer. In theory, you won&#39;t have to compromise on either image quality or gaming performance — you&#39;ll get 99.3 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut, a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio and wide viewing angles, but you&#39;ll still have up to a 175Hz refresh rate and an 0.1ms gray-to-gray pixel response time.</p><p>The bid for a no-compromise panel extends to the software. A Creator mode makes it easier to tweak gamma settings and even flip between DCI-P3 and sRGB color spaces. While there are only so many creators who&#39;ll consider curved displays (the panels can introduce reflections and distortion), this could be helpful if you moonlight as a photo editor.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t quite a dream display. HDR brightness is limited to a modest DisplayHDR 400, and the 3,440 x 1,440  resolution won&#39;t thrill anyone used to 4K or beyond. You might still like the abundance of ports (four USB 3.2 Gen 1 downstream ports, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 upstream, two HDMI 2.0 and one DisplayPort 1.4), and Alienware is promising to fight OLED&#39;s burn-in risk with &quot;improved&quot; reliability and a three-year warranty that covers burn-in artifacts.</p><p>The 34 QD-OLED reaches North America on March 29th. Dell said it would only share pricing closer to the release date, but it&#39;s safe to presume you&#39;ll pay a premium.  The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Alienware" href="https://bit.ly/3FUGcqJ">Alienware</a> team is clearly courting enthusiasts who want do-it-all monitors, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-launches-a-27-inch-version-of-its-pro-ultrafine-4-k-oled-monitors-093236507.html">OLED doesn&#39;t come cheap</a> at these sizes.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alienware-quantum-dot-oled-gaming-monitor-160035802.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28b7864c-a607-42b7-9c06-9becdb0ef5f7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641312788</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T16:13:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3e3fa60-6759-11ec-bbde-5e24a96ee97b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a3e3fa60-6759-11ec-bbde-5e24a96ee97b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Alienware 34 Curved QD-OLED Gaming Monitor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alienware 34 Curved QD-OLED Gaming Monitor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alienware refreshes its M15 and M17 gaming laptops with the latest CPUs and GPUs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s CES season, and there are, inevitably, a bunch of new gaming laptops to check out. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dell/">Dell</a> has joined the party with a refreshed lineup of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Alienware" href="https://bit.ly/3FUGcqJ">Alienware</a> laptops, including the AMD Ryzen-powered M15 R7 and M17 R5.</p><p>You can select a Ryzen 6000-series CPUs to power the M17 R5.

The ThinkPad Z13 and Z16 (representing their screen sizes) is the result of an exclusive collaboration between Lenovo and AMD. The Z13, especially, can be specced with a custom AMD Ryzen 7 Pro chip that has been designed to maximize battery life and performance when you’re trapped inside an endless Zoom, or Microsoft Teams, call.</p><p>Sleeker-looking than your average X1 ThinkPad, the Z-series comes with 16:10 displays and ultra-narrow bezels paired with an FHD webcam. The camera itself sits in a lozenge-shaped mount that doubles as the lip you use to open up the machine, setting it apart from your standard ultraportable. Both machines ship with a 120mm haptic ForcePad and, of course, the red TrackPoint, which can now be double-clicked to open up a shortcut menu to control your webcam and microphone settings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, much of the detail is in the options you can select for these machines, with a 2.8K OLED display on the 13.3-inch model and a 4K OLED on its bigger sibling. The base model Z13 comes with the Ryzen Pro U-Series, or the aforementioned custom Ryzen Pro, while the Z16 ships with a Ryzen Pro H series. Like all of AMD’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-6000-mobile-cpu-rdna2-gaming-160037129.html">new 6000 series mobile chips</a>, both of these machines come with Microsoft’s Pluton security processor to make Windows 11 machines more secure. The larger model, too, gets the ability to come with either integrated or discrete Radeon graphics, depending on your need and budget.</p><p>Both of these models will be available in May 2022, with the Z13’s base model priced at $1,549, while the bigger model will set you back no less than $2,099.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-thinkpad-z13-z16-amd-only-laptop-line-160009720.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4230b5f0-3428-4b6f-a7ad-ac5078e50da7</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 16:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641313167</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T16:19:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/259a9d50-6d6f-11ec-9f95-699f9f7938d7" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/259a9d50-6d6f-11ec-9f95-699f9f7938d7" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lenovo Z13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo Z13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lenovo's newest Smart Clock Essential has Alexa and some cute docks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="e9a9ef05d9a145e882a844954c28922d"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eV-IoawD8Dw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>CES might look a little different this year, but that hasn&#39;t stopped <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Lenovo" href="https://bit.ly/3ETjSML">Lenovo</a> from doing what it does best: using the industry to event to launch many, many new products. In addition to the usual laptops, the company is showing off a new smart clock, the Smart Clock Essential with Alexa. Aside from a minimalist cloth design that clearly borrows from last year&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-clock-2-hands-on-price-specs-availability-040032727.html">Smart Clock 2</a>, the new Essential improves on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-clock-essential-review-150007801.html">the old</a> by adding a pogo docking pin at the bottom and, well, support for Amazon Alexa. The original Essential clock only worked with Google Assistant, and while I was hoping this new device could handle both, the new Essential with Alexa truly is Alexa-only, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:original" href="https://bit.ly/3FUjr6j">original</a> remains available as a Google smart clock.</p><p>As an object that&#39;s meant to sit on your bedside table, there really isn&#39;t much to the new Essential. The fabric comes in either a muted &quot;Clay Red&quot; or pale &quot;Misty Blue,&quot; with the entire front face given over to the 4-inch LED display. The interface is just white text on a deep black background; in addition to the time, you&#39;ll see the day and real-time decibel levels (an interesting touch). If you expected a display for streaming video, a la the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Amazon Echo Show 5</a>, you&#39;d be mistaken. There&#39;s also a mic switch and no built-in camera, a design choice that many people will surely find welcome.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the top edge there are just four buttons: volume buttons, a button for activating the assistant, and another for setting an alarm. There&#39;s also a USB port for charging.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="a6e93be5-f8ac-4a0a-b0b6-5c88d86e52f5"/><p>Although optional, those docking accessories are actually an important part of the story. In addition to a basic pad with room for both the clock and another wireless-charging like a phone, the company is selling what it calls the Ambient Light Dock, which doubles as a nightlight. Available in two whimsical designs — a sea lion and a squid — it has eight different lighting modes and a rainbow of colors, plus the clock&#39;s screen shows a cute anthropomorphic face when you press the assistant button. Now, why a sea lion and squid, specifically? Why not, we say.

So what&#39;s next? Today at CES, AMD is introducing its Ryzen 6000 mobile CPUs, which are built on a 6nm Zen 3+ process and sport a significant upgrade: RDNA 2 graphics. The company claims these new chips will be able to handle most AAA games in 1080p, with gaming performance more than twice as fast as the previous generation&#39;s Radeon graphics.</p><p>You can also expect more than just the usual speed upgrade. AMD claims its Zen 3+ core can achieve better deep sleeping states to save juice, and it includes better adaptive power management features. You can expect the Ryzen 6000 chips to consume around 30 percent less energy while video conferencing. Even better, AMD says they&#39;ll offer up to 24 hours of movie playback. On the security side, Ryzen 6000 is the first platform to integrate Microsoft&#39;s new Pluton security chip.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Overall, the Ryzen 6000 mobile chips will be around 11 percent faster than Ryzen 5000 hardware when it comes to single threaded tasks, and it&#39;ll be up to 28 percent faster for multithreaded work. The new processor family will be spearheaded by the 8-core/16-thread Ryzen 9 6980HX, which can reach up to 5GHz clock speeds. Given that this is an entirely new CPU platform, it also packs in other upgrades like faster DDR5 RAM, which AMD says will dramatically improve performance of the integrated GPU, alongside Wi-Fi 6E integration and better support for PCIe 4.0 and USB 4 devices.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f89befa0-6d6b-11ec-96bf-e42bda4d3d7f" alt="AMD Ryzen 6000 mobile graphics benchmark" data-uuid="0b7163a6-f393-32ab-893f-e65241102ea0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">AMD</div></figure><p>For most shoppers, we&#39;d wager the integrated RDNA 2 graphics will be the biggest draw for many systems. Just a few years ago, you&#39;d need a dedicated GPU to handle decent 1080p gaming. Being able to tackle that with onboard graphics is a major accomplishment for AMD. The RDNA 2 graphics also supports the company&#39;s FreeSync technology to smooth out gameplay, as well as Dynamic HDR displays. AMD claims it&#39;ll also be around 70 percent faster than Intel&#39;s Xe graphics on its 11th generation CPUs.</p><p>AMD isn&#39;t saying much about its Ryzen 6000 U-series chips, which are meant for ultraportables, but they&#39;ll likely benefit from many of the platform&#39;s upgrades. The fastest U-series chip, the Ryzen 7 6800U, will offer eight cores and speeds up to 4.7GHz.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-6000-mobile-cpu-rdna2-gaming-160037129.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3737ea6d-318e-418a-be76-1ab0beffe4f7</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:43:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641311010</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T15:43:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fcf4ad50-6d69-11ec-b7be-b58840a67516" width="4740" height="3240" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fcf4ad50-6d69-11ec-b7be-b58840a67516" width="4740" height="3240" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Marcus / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lisa Su, president and CEO of AMD, gives a keynote address during the 2019 CES in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S., January 9, 2019.

The brand has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jX-hKvUQDU">unveiled</a> an Radeon RX 6000S range of GPUs built specifically for thin-and-light laptops (under 0.78in and 4.5lbs). They tout power and performance-per-watt optimizations that theoretically allow for 20 percent thinner designs without steep hits to performance.</p><p>The mainstream RX 6600S reportedly delivers 80 frames per second or more at high detail settings across a range of recent games, such as <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em> and <em>Deathloop</em>. Bump up to the RX 6700S and you&#39;ll get 100FPS or higher, while the RX 6800S musters 100FPS and beyond at maximum settings. Your real-world experience will almost certainly vary, but AMD clearly believes all of the new GPUs can handle common games without a struggle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are more options if you value performance above portability. The new Radeon RX 6850M is only 7 percent faster than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6000m-gpus-gaming-laptops-030019422.html">the 6800M</a>, but the mid-range RX 6650M and 6650M XT are up to 20 percent faster than the 6600M. You&#39;ll also find starter RX 6300M and 6500M chips that are billed as 200 percent faster than NVIDIA&#39;s GeForce MX450, although we&#39;d expect that gap to narrow with the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2050-laptop-gpu-151030725.html">MX550 and MX570</a>.</p><p>You can expect a wave of laptops using these chips to be announced throughout CES 2022. Prices are bound to vary widely, but they should appear in the first quarter.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ee69cae0-6d73-11ec-aed9-b5628d22c5da" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="AMD Radeon RX 6500 XT desktop GPU" data-uuid="2d7cd064-6684-39b5-8f87-19a9c535ad29"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">AMD</div></figure><p>And yes, there&#39;s plenty for desktop gamers — including a long-awaited software feature. The Radeon RX 6500 XT rivals NVIDIA&#39;s GeForce GTX 1650 with a claimed 20 to 60 percent higher performance in 1080p games. And importantly, there&#39;s a new Radeon Super Resolution feature that better counters NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS upscaling. Enable it in &quot;thousands&quot; of games and you can use a lower internal resolution (like 1440p) to boost frame rates at 4K. The Adrenalin Edition software needed to enable RSR won&#39;t be available until later in the first quarter, but it will come with perks like an enhanced AMD Link (up to four friends can connect to your desktop) and an eye-tracking Privacy View.</p><p>The RX 6500 XT arrives January 19th for $199. That&#39;s a solid value if the performance claims hold up, although we&#39;d note that chronic GPU shortages could easily send that price skyward.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amd-radeon-rx-6000s-rx-6500-xt-gpu-154302946.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8fa29fb4-bd34-499e-a103-d772395ad7fa</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:43:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641310987</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T15:43:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c6602570-6d6f-11ec-ba7e-74d300cf092c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c6602570-6d6f-11ec-ba7e-74d300cf092c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AMD]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AMD Radeon RX 6000S laptop GPU]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AMD Radeon RX 6000S laptop GPU]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TP-Link’s new WiFi 6E router has motorized antennas that follow your devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Optimizing a router for your space can be a pain, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tp-link/">TP-Link</a> is looking to take some of the sting out of that with a wild new router. The Archer AXE200 Omni is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/wi-fi%206e/">WiFi 6E</a> model with four mechanical antennas that rotate automatically.

It says the device can provide WiFi speeds of up to 16Gbps. Having more bands could reduce network congestion. You can set up a dedicated band, which should be useful for things like online gaming if your console or PC is too far away from the router to connect it via Ethernet.</p><p>In addition, the company’s latest flagship mesh system is the Deco XE200. With the help of WiFi 6E, TP-Link claims it can deliver speeds of up to 11Gbps. A two-pack should cover up to 6,500 square feet and connect more than 200 devices.</p><p>All three of these router systems will come with TP-Link HomeShield to provide owners with full control of their network as well as a degree of security. The company announced several other WiFi 6E products at CES, including the Deco Voice X50, which has a built-in smart speaker, and a unit designed to extend a mesh network outdoors. All of these routers should be available in 2022.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tp-link-router-antennas-automatically-move-wifi-6e-151032290.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5155b4b4-0cd5-4dd7-8c1e-c04a63fb10f7</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:10:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641312316</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T16:05:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/041d3990-6d78-11ec-bfbe-819cb6d7cfa5" width="1047" height="740" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/041d3990-6d78-11ec-bfbe-819cb6d7cfa5" width="1047" height="740" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TP-Link]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The TP-Link Archer AXE200 Omni router against a white background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Archer AXE200 Omni]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's 2022 Quantum Dot OLED TVs can tweak quality settings using a camera]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony thinks it knows how to counter the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-g2-c2-annoucement-020045964.html">latest OLED</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2022-qled-microled-8k-4k-tv-020046596.html">mini-LED</a> TVs from its rivals: add a dash of intelligence. Its 2022 A-series 4K OLED TVs, plus its Z- (8K) and X-series (4K) mini-LED and basic LCD models, can use a new Bravia Cam (the &#39;bump&#39; shown at top) for video chat, gesture control and even optimizing the picture and sound quality. They can tweak the brightness, voice emphasis and sound balance based on your viewing distance and direction. You can also have the picture dim when you leave the room, or display a warning when your kids get too close to the screen.</p><p>The camera is bundled with the flagship <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/televisions/all-tvs/p/xr65a95k">A95K</a> and <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/tv-video/televisions/all-tvs/p/xr75z9k">Z9K</a> models, and is optional for Sony&#39;s other 2022 sets. You&#39;ll need a firmware update to unlock more than video chat, but the company hasn&#39;t said when that might arrive. And yes, Sony is aware of privacy concerns. There&#39;s a hardware switch to disable the camera, and neither the camera nor the TV will store private data.

The A95K uses a new Quantum Dot OLED panel to reproduce a larger color range at wider viewing angles, while the Z9K and X95K have smarter backlighting that reduces mini-LED&#39;s characteristic light blooming without lowering brightness. A Netflix Adaptive Calibrated Mode adjusts output based on ambient light, while Bravia Core Calibrated Mode alters quality to match a director&#39;s &quot;original vision.&quot; And yes, there&#39;s tight integration with other Sony products — they can harmonize with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-preorder-163641637.html">higher-end soundbars</a> and speakers (the built-in speakers are also richer), while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html">PlayStation 5</a> owners can take advantage of both automatic picture mode switching as well as auto HDR tone mapping.</p><p>Other improvements include a switch to the unified, media-centric <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chromecast-with-google-tv-review-163024220.html">Google TV</a> interface and smaller, simpler remotes that add backlighting and a find-my-remote feature. A95K uses also have a stand that can sit at the front or back to suit your viewing environment.</p><p>Sony won&#39;t provide pricing and ship dates until the spring, but it&#39;s using a familiar size strategy. The Z9K is unsurprisingly limited to 8K-friendly 75- and 85-inch sizes, while the A95K sits in the sweet spot with 55- and 65-inch variants. The A90K is built for gamers&#39; desks and dorm rooms with 42- and 48-inch sizes (and an optional high position stand), while the &#39;entry&#39; A80K courts the mainstream with 55-, 65- and 77-inch panels. The X95K comes in 65-, 75- and 85-inch flavors, while the full array LED-lit X90K comes in 55-, 65-, 75- and 85-inch versions. The X80K and X85K have &#39;just&#39; direct LED backlighting, but are available in a wide range of sizes from 43 inches through to 85 inches.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-2022-oled-mini-led-google-tv-lineup-150041942.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dc33959c-9b6a-47c0-9cc4-7b2e36673af3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641307825</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T14:50:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e24eaec0-6d63-11ec-ad8d-7d72c1737289" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e24eaec0-6d63-11ec-ad8d-7d72c1737289" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony Bravia A95K OLED TV with camera]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony Bravia A95K OLED TV with camera]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony is bringing 360-degree sound mapping to its latest soundbars]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Sony debuted its premium home theater gear for 2021, the company&#39;s pricey <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html">HT-A9 speaker set</a> had a key feature that its soundbars didn&#39;t. It&#39;s called 360 Spatial Sound Mapping and it creates &quot;phantom speakers&quot; to help the actual speakers produce room-filling sound. Today at CES, Sony announced that it will offer an upgrade to both the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html">HT-A7000</a> (7.1.2) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a5000-soundbar-announced-specs-price-availability-140034265.html">HT-A5000</a> (5.1.2) soundbars that adds the 360-degree audio mapping later this spring.&nbsp;</p><p>360 Spatial Sound Mapping first uses a combination of Sound Field Optimization tech and built-in microphones to measure the height and position of both a soundbar and rear speakers. Once that&#39;s done, the setup creates virtual speakers by positioning sound waves based on the collected location information. Sony says the result is a &quot;wide spatial sound field&quot; capable of filling a room and it promises that everyone will get &quot;the same sound experience&quot; no matter where they&#39;re sitting. The company also reminded us that an Acoustic Center Sync feature on Bravia XR TVs will work with the sound mapping to become a center speaker that enhances dialogue. Both the A7000 and A5000 already support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-360-reality-audio-ces-2021-130027671.html">Sony&#39;s 360 Reality Audio</a> for more immersive music listening.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/72b05150-6d03-11ec-aeaf-cceeaae020f2" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="Sony SA-RS5 speakers" data-uuid="03615776-e7af-3557-857c-5df45308b64c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>To help you make the most out of the soundbars&#39; new ability, Sony is debuting a new set of wireless rear speakers. Unlike most rear satellites that connect wirelessly but rely on a cord for power, <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/soundbars/all-soundbars/p/sars5">the new SA-RS5 speakers</a> are totally wireless and can be charged out of sight. The company says you can expect up to 10 hours of use when they&#39;re fully charged and 10 minutes will give you 90 minutes of play time if you forget to replenish the batteries. They also feature up-firing speakers, wide directional woofers, dome tweeters and dual passive radiators for a more robust soundstage and better clarity. The SA-RS5 can run Sony&#39;s Sound Field Optimization with the press of a button so they&#39;re easily calibrated with your soundbar each time you reposition them. Lastly, the cylindrical speakers have a flat back side so they&#39;ll sit nicely against a wall.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll need a set of rear speakers to employ the forthcoming 360 Spatial Sound Mapping upgrade on the aforementioned soundbars — hence the new model. If you can live without all the bells and whistles of the SA-RS5, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html">SA-RS3S</a> is also compatible. They&#39;re a plain ol&#39; set of two-way rear satellite speakers in comparison, but they&#39;ll save you some money over the upcoming model at $350. And <a href="https://www.engadget.com/home-entertainment-gift-ideas-143038506.html">based on my experience</a>, they should get the job done just fine.&nbsp;</p><p>The new SA-RS5 wireless rear speakers will be available this spring for $600. That&#39;s $250 more than the SA-RS3S that debuted alongside the HT-A7000 last year.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-360-spatial-sound-mapping-update-ht-a7000-ht-a5000-150035957.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97f90428-b87f-4750-b202-a37848794198</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 15:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641265431</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T03:03:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cff960a0-e904-11eb-a7ff-cc0e36ef054f" width="1200" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cff960a0-e904-11eb-a7ff-cc0e36ef054f" width="1200" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony HT-A7000 soundbar, SA-SW5 subwoofer, SA-SW3 subwoofer and SA-RS3S speakers.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony HT-A7000 soundbar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's Mac Mini M1 is $50 off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While we saw the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Mac Mini M1" href="https://amzn.to/3JFEqMj">Mac Mini M1</a> drop in price during the holiday shopping season, you have another chance to grab the desktop for less right now.

It has a 6.52-inch display at 1,600 x 720 resolution and up to 90Hz refresh rate. With a 4,500mAh battery, it runs on one of Mediatek’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mediatek-5g-nr-dimensity-820-processor-070036831.html">Dimensity chips</a>, the Dimensity 700, which have been designed to work better with AI tasks like image processing.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Talking of images, there’s a triple camera system, but no need to get too excited. There’s a depth sensor and a 2-megapixel camera, meaning that most of the work will be done by the single 13-megapixel main camera sensor. It’ll be able to record video up to 1080p – another reminder that these are affordable phones first, impressive specs are less of a priority. Much less.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b7ff7a60-6d44-11ec-bd7f-b614bba4a971" style="height:1496;width:2120;" alt="TCL 30 series 2022" data-uuid="0dedf598-33b6-30ba-8c22-158de1c5bab5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p>The TCL 30 V has a bigger 6.67-inch display, running at 1,080 x 2,400 resolution. That’s more pixels than the 30 XE, but lacks the 90Hz refresh rate. Compromises! It runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 480 chip — again different to the XE – with a more substantial 50-megapixel primary camera working alongside a 5MP super-wide shooter and a 2MP macro lens. Unlike the notched front-facing camera of the 30 XE, the bigger 30 V has a pinhole in the screen for its 16MP selfie cam. It also has a 4,500mAh battery which should ensure it lasts the day, given the lightweight specs of the device. Both devices are coming exclusively to the US, but on different carriers. The TCL 30 XE 5G launches on T Mobile – date TBC – while the 30 V is landing on Verizon.</p><p>Adoption from two US carriers will make TCL&#39;s phones a more realistic option than in previous years.  However, we’re missing one big piece of the puzzle: how affordable they actually are. Expect to hear pricing in the coming weeks. If you’re looking for bigger specs (and prices, possibly), TCL is teasing more 30 series news at MWC in Barcelona later this year.</p><p></p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tcl-30-series-ces-2022-smartphones-launch-date-price-140051967.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">56c6ca9c-594a-40e2-823c-f38ad7251898</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 14:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641295343</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T11:22:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b8017630-6d44-11ec-9e7f-170f0b0e36eb" width="2126" height="1500" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b8017630-6d44-11ec-9e7f-170f0b0e36eb" width="2126" height="1500" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TCL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TCL 30 series 2022]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TCL 30 series 2022]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Seoul Robotics' autonomous 'Control Tower' remotely manages self-driving vehicle fleets]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Despite Tesla&#39;s ambitious claims of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">its vehicles&#39; Full Self-Driving capabilities</a>, today&#39;s autonomous navigation technology generally tops out at <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/automotive/autonomous-driving-levels.html">Level 2</a>. More advanced self-driving systems are in development but likely still years away from being safe and cost-effective enough for everyday use. Seoul Robotics, however, has developed a mesh network that reportedly imparts Level 5 autonomy to vehicle fleets, if only for the &quot;last mile.&quot;</p><p>The company&#39;s Level 5 Control Tower system sidesteps some technical challenges of self-driving technology by embedding sensors in the surrounding infrastructure — traffic lights, nearby buildings, freeway overpasses, etc — rather than on the vehicles themselves.

That system utilizes Seoul Robotics&#39; SENSR software and a network of hundreds of LiDAR sensors embedded around the facility to autonomously move newly-constructed vehicles across the factory floor.

The biggest was comfort, both for eye-strain and the problem of resting a 130 gram (4.5oz) piece of hardware on your nose. Thankfully, it looks as if TCL has sought to address that issue with its second model, the TCL Nxtwear Air.</p><p>Essentially, the TCL Nxtwear Air takes many of the same components from the first one, but has managed to shave off around a third of the weight. The glasses now weigh 75 grams, and look to be a lot more stylish than the first model, including interchangeable fascias to customize the glasses to your style. As much as I’d loathe adding more weight to my face, I do quite like the look of the faux-Wayfarer panel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Far as I can tell, the displays remain the same: Two 1080p Micro OLED panels designed to replicate the feel of a 140-inch screen. The press release does, however, say that color reproduction has been improved, since the pictures on the first model were occasionally washed out. You’ll also get spatial audio, and given the speakers are sited in the arms, that sounds like a smart improvement for movie watching.</p><p>Naturally, TCL isn’t talking about when we can get our hands on one, or how much it’ll cost when we actually do. But if it’s less than the frankly outrageous prices you had to fork out for the first model, it’ll be a good start.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtwear-air-ces-2022-140023313.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">09278745-1081-4a21-993b-28e62b72ab0e</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 14:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641299620</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T12:33:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/38ee6560-6d58-11ec-bdb5-9c1e65b5e71d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/38ee6560-6d58-11ec-bdb5-9c1e65b5e71d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TCL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TCL Nxtwear Air (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TCL Nxtwear Air]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TCL's first laptop is the $349 Book 14 Go]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TCL, which is mostly known for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-update-fixes-google-tv-performance-issues-103044084.html">TVs</a> and other electronics, has launched its very first laptop called the Book 14 Go. It&#39;s a 14.1-inch Windows 11 laptop that&#39;s powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon chip, with a 12-hour battery life and 4G LTE connectivity. While Snapdragon laptops are traditionally on the pricier side, the Book 14 Go will only set you back $349 when it launches in select regions in the second quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>The company was likely able to keep its price down, in part because it&#39;s powered by Qualcomm&#39;s affordable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-7c-gen-2-165508430.html">Snapdragon 7c</a> platform meant for use with entry-level PCs and Chromebooks. Snapdragon 7c enables both LTE connectivity and lengthy battery life for laptops meant to be always switched on. TCL designed the Book 14 Go to be portable, with a depth of 13.95 mm and a body that weighs 2.9 pounds.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to its first laptop, TCL has also announced its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tcl-nxtpaper-tablet-lcd-paper-color-video-price-specs-availability-tab-10s-5g-160025391.html">NXTPAPER tablet</a>, the 10s. The NXTPAPER 10s features the brand&#39;s full color paper-like display technology, which is a low-power reflective LCD that doesn&#39;t need backlighting. It has an anti-glare finish that allows you see what&#39;s playing from any angle and reduces blue light by over 50 percent. TCL says the display&#39;s attributes make looking at the screen more comfortable, thereby making it ideal for studying and for taking notes with its accompanying T Pen stylus. The NXTPAPER 10s will initially be available later this month in Europe and China for $249.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1bdf7c20-6d5d-11ec-9f64-9b602c62318c" alt="TCL" data-uuid="76e4af6a-8b2d-30ed-86e1-bd26047e2528"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p>TCL will also release a pair of budget tablets, the $129 TAB 8 4G and the $99 TAB 10L, in the first quarter. If you&#39;re looking for even cheaper tablets for kids, it will release the $89 MINI, $149 MID and $119 MAX tablets in the same quarter for select markets, as well. All new tablets will come with support for the TCL Kids service that&#39;s launching in the second quarter to give subscribers access to a child-friendly library of educational and entertainment videos, storybooks and apps for $4 a month.

In 2019, the company took a big step forward with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-skydio-2-review.html">Skydio 2</a>, releasing a UAV that had one of the best obstacle avoidance systems we had seen up to that point. With CES 2022 underway, it’s back with an updated model of that drone called the Skydio 2 Plus that adds both hardware and software enhancements.</p><p>The new model features two additional antennas compared to the Skydio 2, allowing you to fly it up to 6 kilometers away in any one direction. By contrast, its predecessor had a range of 3.5 kilometers. Additionally, Skydio claims an improvement in battery life extends the new model’s flying time by 20 percent. The company has also updated its Beacon remote to extend its range to 3 kilometers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Alongside the Plus model, Skydio introduced KeyFrame, an AI-powered feature the company says will allow “anyone” to “design impossible camera motion that is smooth, precise and repeatable.” As the name suggests, you select a handful of keyframes you want the drone to capture, the software then links them together in one continuous motion. Compared to DJI, Skydio hasn’t had the most expansive or robust set of camera modes, so the addition of KeyFrame is an important one for the company.</p><p>The Skydio 2 Plus is available today starting at $1099. The KeyFrame feature is also available today on both Skydio 2 and 2 Plus drones.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/skydio-2-plus-annoucement-140001073.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3af7a653-6b5f-4bb3-b1eb-af8375f5e1d7</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 14:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641221543</ingested><modified>2022-01-03T14:52:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c34145e0-6432-11ec-9fa6-47f8be4e665c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c34145e0-6432-11ec-9fa6-47f8be4e665c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Skydio]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Skydio 2+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Skydio 2+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[JBL's first gaming microphone is the USB 'Quantum Stream']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:JBL" href="https://fave.co/3eP7ToN">JBL</a> has expanded its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-jbl-quantum-gaming-headphones-speaker.html">Quantum</a> gaming line with new products, including its first USB microphone aimed at  streamers and podcasters.

The wireless earbuds can connect to a mobile device via Bluetooth, but they also come with a USB-C dongle for low latency connection to PCs, the PlayStation and the Nintendo Switch.

At CES 2022, luxury audio brand <a href="https://www.marklevinson.com/">Mark Levinson</a> would like a word. The Harman-owned company (which also owns AKG, JBL and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Harman Kardon" href="https://fave.co/3sUTM9L">Harman Kardon</a>, and is itself <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-14-samsung-buys-harmon-auto-audio.html">a Samsung subsidiary</a>) mostly known for its high-end home and car audio systems has announced its first wireless headphones: the No. 5909. While they offer everything you&#39;d expect from a premium set, they have a nearly $1,000 price tag that only a select few might commit to.&nbsp;</p><p>The over-ear No. 5909 packs 40mm Beryllium drivers &quot;expertly tuned to the Harman curve.&quot; The company explains that &quot;the Harman curve&quot; is acoustic response that it says has taken decades of research to construct. The result here is &quot;incredible acoustic performance&quot; in a set of &quot;reference class&quot; wireless headphones. Mark Levinson says that audio performance meets the guidelines for Hi-Res Audio certification thanks to 24-bit/96kHz signal processing and 40kHz acoustic response. The No. 5909 supports LDAC, AAC and aptX Adaptive wireless codecs via Bluetooth 5.1.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Mark Levinson promises you&#39;ll hear details you haven&#39;t before, like &quot;the slightest breath an artist takes&quot; or &quot;a hidden harmony.&quot; The company explains that the same &quot;world-class sound engineers&quot; that built the luxury brand&#39;s amps, turntables and streaming players are behind the tuning of the ultra pricey No. 5909.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9a00d660-6cfb-11ec-adeb-cb245e3c0565" alt="Mark Levinson No. 5909" data-uuid="f771396c-63a4-3ce1-aa37-5d997b52d8ba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mark Levinson/Harman</div></figure><p>Sound quality isn&#39;t the only consideration though. The No. 5909 has adaptive active noise cancellation (ANC) with three modes &quot;for premium sound isolation&quot; and an Ambient Aware feature that lets you tune into your surroundings as needed. The company also packed in four microphones for calls that are equipped with a so-called Smart Wind Adaption feature. The materials used to make the headphones are also better than the mostly plastic sets we typically see. The No. 5909 is built with an aluminum frame, painted metallic earcups, leather headband and replaceable leather ear cushions. An included hard shell travel case comes stocked with a USB-C charging cable, USB-C to USB-A adaptor, two USB-C to 3.5mm cables, 3.5mm to 6.3mm adaptor, airplane adaptor and a polishing cloth. Basically, it&#39;s everything you&#39;d need to use the headphones on any setup — wired, wireless or while traveling.&nbsp;</p><p>Mark Levinson says you can expect up to 30 hours of use with adaptive ANC active and up to 34 hours with the feature disabled. A quick-charge feature will give you up to six hours of play time in 15 minutes. Via an app for Android and iOS, you&#39;ll get some control over the headphones, but the company didn&#39;t go into specifics there.&nbsp;</p><p>The No. 5909 will be available in black, pewter and red color options starting today for $999.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mark-levinson-5909-headphones-announced-price-specs-130056543.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f15e4641-f202-40a5-bdec-e72b9a1736da</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 13:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641302864</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T13:27:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/63064510-6cd2-11ec-bffb-5e01fa94904b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/63064510-6cd2-11ec-bffb-5e01fa94904b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JBL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JBL Mark Levinson 5909 headphones]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JBL Mark Levinson 5909]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
