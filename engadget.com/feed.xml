It’s not a mic, but the effect is about the same. Google’s chief of hardware had just shown me a demo of the company’s latest feature: computational processing for video that will debut on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. The feature was only possible with Google’s own mobile processor, which it’s announcing today.</p><p>He’s understandably proud and excited to share the news. The chip is called Tensor, and it’s the first system-on-chip (SoC) designed by Google. The company has “been at this about five years,” he said, though CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a statement that Tensor “has been four years in the making and builds off of two decades of Google’s computing experience.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That software expertise is something Google has come to be known for. It led the way in computational photography <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-14-google-pixel-night-sight-launch-sample-photos-comparison.html">with its Night Sight mode for low light shots</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-11-google-duplex-ai-tough-questions-answers-now.html">weirded out</a> the world with how successfully its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-google-duplex-ai-phone-call.html">conversational AI Duplex</a> was able to mimic human speech — right down to the “ums and ahs.” Tensor both leverages Google’s machine learning prowess and enables the company to bring AI experiences to smartphones that it couldn’t before.</p><p>Holding a diet Coke in one hand and gesturing animatedly with the other, Osterloh threw around hyperbolic marketing language like “We’re transforming the computing experience” and “It’ll be what we consider to be a pretty dramatic transformation overall.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a6bfa10-f282-11eb-bbdf-ac92842b242f" alt="Six Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro devices laying on a grey surface at various angles, perpendicular to each other." data-uuid="8088beeb-d9d8-3961-b9c9-9f34e121454a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>He’s alluding to Tensor enabling experiences that previous chips (the company’s mostly used Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors in its prior phones) couldn’t deliver. Things like being able to run multiple AI-intensive tasks simultaneously without a phone overheating, or having enough power to apply computational processing to videos as they’re being captured.</p><p>That belief in Tensor’s significance is part of why Google chose to announce it today ahead of the Pixel 6’s actual launch in the fall. The company isn’t giving away all the details about the processor yet, nor is it sharing specific information about its latest flagships now. But “there&#39;s a lot of new stuff here, and we wanted to make sure people had context,” Osterloh said. “We think it’s a really big change, so that’s why we want to start early.”</p><p>Plus, there’s an added benefit. “Information gets out,” Osterloh added. “Nowadays it’s like, stuff leaks.”</p><h2>A new chip design with AI infused</h2><p>Thanks to those leaks, though, we’ve heard plenty of rumors about Google’s efforts to make its <a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-readies-its-own-chip-for-future-pixels-chromebooks-e5f8479e-4a38-485c-a264-9ef9cf68908c.html">own mobile processor for a while</a>, under the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-silicon-whitechapel-pixel-6-170200955.html">code name Project Whitechapel</a>. While the company won’t publicly discuss code names, it’s clear that work on Tensor has been going on for a long time.</p><p>The chip’s name is an obvious nod to the company’s open-source platform for machine learning, TensorFlow, Osterloh said, and that should tell you how big a role AI plays in this processor. Though Google isn’t ready to share the full details about Tensor yet, Osterloh did explain that the SoC is an ARM chip designed around a TPU, or Tensor Processing Unit. The mobile chip was co-designed with Google’s AI researchers and the TPU is based on their larger versions in the company’s data centers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/266992b0-f284-11eb-bd19-aa5a81c1ac61" alt="A rendering of Google&#39;s Tensor mobile chip with words on it saying " data-uuid="7f6473b5-534f-39c9-9006-df79555438e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>It’s not just designed to speed up machine learning tasks on your phone, either. Osterloh said they’ve also redesigned the image signal processor, or ISP. Specifically, he said there are a “few points in the ISP where we can actually insert machine learning, which is new.”</p><p>Google also reconstructed the memory architecture to make it easier to access RAM, and allow for data manipulation while processing images. There are also a few places where Osterloh said they’ve directly encoded their image processing algorithms into the hardware. He says this allows Google to do “stuff that was previously impossible to do on standard SoCs,” though he didn’t share specific details on what Tensor now enables that previous SoCs couldn’t.</p><p>Of course, with this being Google’s first mobile chip, Osterloh concedes people might see the company as unproven. Though he did push back by saying, “I think people are pretty aware of Google’s overall capability.”</p><p>It’s natural to wonder if the company can compete in areas like power efficiency and heat management. Osterloh said they’ve designed Tensor to perform some tasks more power efficiently than previous processors they’ve used while staying within a thermal threshold. Similar to existing processors, Osterloh said “the system has a bunch of different subsystems, [and] we can use the most power efficient element of it for the task at hand.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/48a10890-f284-11eb-b597-5fa79b144805" alt="Side view of the peach/gold Pixel 6 Pro." data-uuid="73539ec3-e8f6-3e31-95e3-4c242eef56df"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Though there’s an ongoing global chip shortage, Osterloh is confident that Google can manage demand. “Everyone’s affected by this, no doubt,” he said. “The positive thing about this is it’s under our control, we’re making this and we’re responsible for it. So we think we should be okay.”</p><h2>Why make Tensor?</h2><p>So what can Tensor do that other mobile processors can’t? Google is saving most of the juicy bits for the Pixel 6’s launch in the fall. But, it did offer two examples of areas that would see dramatic improvement: Photography and voice recognition (and processing). At our meeting, Osterloh showed off some demos of new Tensor-enabled features on the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro, which also gives us our first look at the phones. The handsets feature a distinctive new look and bright color options. They also have a horizontal camera bump that spans the width of the rear, which is “a very intentional part of the design,” Osterloh notes. &quot;We’ve really been known for photography, [so] we wanted to really emphasize this.”</p><p>Google’s upgraded the cameras themselves, but the promised photography improvements aren’t just from optical hardware. Tensor is behind some of it. With previous chips, the company kept running into limits when trying to improve photography on its phones. “These weren’t designed for machine learning, or AI, and certainly not designed to optimize for where Google’s headed,” he said.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/05ad8eb0-f283-11eb-bff7-d139a54bce0d" alt="Three Pixel 6 phones. From left to right, their color schemes are black/black, green/blue and red/peach." data-uuid="21fe90d2-f119-3daa-a3c2-c853a4dee4f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>So where is Google headed? Towards a world <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-15-google-nest-smart-home-fix-plan.html">of “ambient computing,”</a> a vision that Osterloh and many of his colleagues have touted in the past. They see a future where all the devices and sensors we’re surrounded by can communicate with Google (sometimes via the Assistant) or the internet. But Osterloh knows that for most people, the most important device is still going to be the smartphone. “We see the mobile phone as the center of that.”</p><p>So when Google wanted to improve beyond the limits of contemporary processors, it had to do something different. “What we&#39;ve done in the past, when we encountered these kinds of engineering, constraints and technical constraints, is we take on the problem ourselves,” Osterloh said.</p><h2>Upgrading photo and video processing</h2><p>With Tensor, the Pixel 6 can do things like concurrently capture images from two sensors, with the main one recording at normal exposure and the wide-angle running at a much faster shutter speed. Osterloh said the system runs a number of different machine learning models in real time to help figure out stuff about the scene, like whether there’s a face and is the device moving or shaking. The Pixel 6 will then combine all that info and use it to process photos so that if you’re trying to capture a hyperactive puppy or toddler, you’ll be less likely to get a blurry shot.</p><p>Tensor will also let Google perform computationally intensive tasks while you’re shooting video. Osterloh said that in the past the company hasn’t been able to apply a lot of machine learning to video, since it would be too taxing for a phone processor. But “that all changes with Tensor,” he said. One thing they’ve been able to run is an HDRnet model on videos, which drastically improves quality in tricky situations like when the camera is pointing at the sun.</p><p>Osterloh showed me demos of how the Pixel 6 did both these things, including a before-and-after example of a blurry photo of an active child and video comparisons of a campground at sunset. While there was a clear difference, I unfortunately can’t show you the results. Besides, these were controlled demos from Google. I can’t really gauge how impressive and useful these features are until we get to test them in the real world.</p><h2>Improvements in voice and speech</h2><p>I did get to see a more telling preview, though. Osterloh also showed me how voice dictation will work in the Pixel 6 on GBoard. On the upcoming phone, you’ll be able to hit the microphone button in the compose field, narrate your message and use hotwords like “Send” or “Clear” to trigger actions. You can also edit typos via the onscreen keyboard while the mic is still listening for your dictation.</p><p>This all works via a new Speech On Device API, and I was impressed that the system was smart enough to distinguish between when you say “Send” in “I will send the kids to school” versus when you’re telling it to send the message. Osterloh told me the algorithm is looking not just for the hotword but also your tone of voice and delivery before it triggers the action.</p><p>Finally, there are a couple more things that Osterloh showed me: Live Caption with Translate, as well as Android 12’s Material You design. Thanks to Tensor, Android’s Live Caption feature, which provides subtitles for anything playing through your device’s sound system, will be able to translate what’s being said in real time as well. This all happens on device, so the next time you’re watching a foreign-language TED Talk or your favorite international TV show, it won’t matter if they don’t have subtitles — Tensor will provide.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/017c9f10-b8c3-11eb-9d45-51b82cbc3318" alt="Android 12 Beta" data-uuid="1ff5cf9e-bbb9-30db-9806-e6ac39ca0e98"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><h2>A look at Material You</h2><p>Meanwhile, Material You, which Google first unveiled at I/O this year, is what Osterloh called the biggest UI change in Android maybe since the beginning. I’ve been waiting to see the feature in the Android 12 public beta, but it’s still not available there. At our meeting, Osterloh showed me how it works — he changed the wallpaper of a Pixel 6 from something more rosy hued to a scene of a body of water, and the system’s icons and highlights quickly updated to match. App icons were painted to match as well, but something new I learned from this demo was that if you’re like me and prefer your icons to keep their original colors, you can opt to leave them untouched.</p><p>We’ve gotten a really good look at what’s coming in the fall, though Google is still keeping plenty of details under wraps. We don’t know yet if it plans to say if it had help from other manufacturers in coming up with Tensor, and details about CPU and GPU cores, clock speeds and other components will be shared later this year. But with the new chip, Google’s been able to realize a years-long dream.</p><p>“We kind of see this as The Google Phone,” he said. “This is what we set out to build several years ago and we’re finally here.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">75b90b61-1229-4618-88c8-85112803ae09</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 16:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627917699</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T15:21:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc7dc2f0-f283-11eb-9d38-3989c4f60031" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc7dc2f0-f283-11eb-9d38-3989c4f60031" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A rendering of Google's Tensor chip.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Tensor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google’s Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will use AI everywhere]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Smartphone launch season is typically in the fall, but Google has unexpectedly early news to share today. The company just announced that not only is the Pixel 6 coming this fall, but it’ll feature the very first system-on-chip designed by Google. The chip is called Tensor and it leverages the company’s AI expertise to enable more powerful and better integrated machine learning on devices. At a demo event to show off Tensor’s prowess, I was able to check out the Pixel 6 with the company’s chief of hardware Rick Osterloh. I wasn’t allowed to take pictures or video, and Google hasn’t shared all of the phones’ specs, but I can tell you about a few new features.</p><p>First, there will be two lines: Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. Google hasn’t shared the actual dimensions yet, but the Pro, which is larger, felt similar in size to a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. They both look like <a href="https://www.frontpagetech.com/2021/07/08/exclusive-full-final-specifications-for-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro/">the leaked renders we’ve seen</a>, except shinier and three-dimensional. There’s a band about an inch tall on the rear in black, lime green or peachy red, and below that sits a horizontal camera bump that stretches across the case. According to Google&#39;s blog post, the sensors and lenses were improved and &quot;are now too big to fit into the traditional square.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yes, when you place the Pixel 6 on a table there’s still a slope because of the bar, but since it’s not off to a corner like on prior Pixels (or Galaxy phones or iPhones), the phone won’t wobble from side to side. The rest of the back is black, pastel green or pastel peach correspondingly.</p><p>For the Pro line, the colors are more subtle with less contrast between the sections, but they have what Osterloh called “high gloss metal accents” along the edges. The camera bump also gets this shiny treatment on the Pros, which come in black, white and sort of a light orange. The regular Pixel 6 has a matte finish on its sides. All the phones I saw appeared to have glass on their backs, with screens that are slightly curved along the edges. Google also moved the selfie camera from the top left corner to the middle of the display.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/05ad8eb0-f283-11eb-bff7-d139a54bce0d" alt="Three Pixel 6 phones. From left to right, their color schemes are black/black, green/blue and red/peach." data-uuid="21fe90d2-f119-3daa-a3c2-c853a4dee4f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>I loved the peachy pastel version of the Pixel 6, though the mostly black version would suit those who prefer something less flashy. (Google doesn’t have names for the colors yet, though Osterloh said their marketing team has fun with them.)</p><p>More importantly, Google’s upgraded the cameras themselves. It’s not sharing specific megapixel or sensor size information yet, but did say these are sharper and larger sensors than before. Osterloh said the Pixel 6’s main camera will let in about 150% more light than previous Pixels. There’s also an ultrawide lens for both models, and the Pro gets an extra telephoto option as well with 4x optical zoom.</p><p>In addition to the actual camera hardware improvements, the Pixel 6s promise better photo processing thanks to Tensor. At our meeting, Osterloh highlighted changes coming in how Google will process images and videos for clearer, better exposed images of moving subjects. The company was also able to apply things like an HDRNet to video as it’s recording a scene to ease tricky situations like shooting a campsite with the phone pointed at the sun.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/3a661be0-f283-11eb-8ebf-11a88cc103bd" alt="A trio of Pixel 6 Pros. From left to right, their color schemes are: Black/black, Gold/yellow and Grey/silver." data-uuid="116553b4-3a08-320c-aea2-0cde70db847f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google also redesigned its speech software, with a new platform called SODA (Speech On Device API) that lets apps leverage Tensor for data-center-level speech recognition. Better yet, Osterloh said this all runs at half the power it used to on prior Pixels. He showed me a new Live Caption with Translate feature that subtitles all audio playing through your phone’s sound system. With Tensor, the device can both transcribe and translate what’s playing at the same (ish) time, without needing to use the cloud for processing.</p><p>Dictation is also getting some major upgrades. In GBoard on the Pixel 6, you’ll be able to hit the microphone button in the compose field, narrate your message and use hotwords like “Send” or “Clear” to trigger actions. You can also edit typos via the onscreen keyboard while the mic is still listening for your dictation.</p><p>We don’t have all the details on CPU and GPU cores or clock speeds, RAM and battery life yet — those will come later. But Osterloh did say Google knows “users expect to get a day’s worth of battery life,” and that it’s aiming for that mark but to also “offer them a lot more capability in that period of time.” The devices will also support 5G, which “in the US means supporting all the different bands we have here,” Osterloh said. He declined to name any brands of 5G modems, though.</p><p>Though it’s not an official launch for the Pixel 6, this preview has shown us a lot. There will be new cameras, new design, new UI (in Android 12) and a new chip, among other things. Osterloh said he’s excited about the launch. “We kind of see this as The Google Phone,” he said. “This is what we set out to build several years ago and we’re finally here.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9027784a-8270-49e0-a68f-14a5282dec20</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 16:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627917461</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T15:17:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a6bfa10-f282-11eb-bbdf-ac92842b242f" width="1600" height="942" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9a6bfa10-f282-11eb-bbdf-ac92842b242f" width="1600" height="942" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Six Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro devices laying on a grey surface at various angles, perpendicular to each other.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[R2-D2 is now a Tamagotchi you’ll forget about]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>R2-D2 might be the most beloved character in the entire <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/star%20wars">Star Wars</a> universe.

The newly introduced L75ms doesn&#39;t have a catchy name, but it combines a slick-looking walnut wood cabinet with a higher-end speaker system that includes both a 32-bit/192kHz DAC and modern streaming audio conveniences. While you can&#39;t really use the built-in Bluetooth for lossless sound, you can use the Ethernet and other wired connections to stream top-tier audio, including through AirPlay 2 and Chromecast.</p><p>The company even offers a 90-day <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-qobuz-drops-lossy-music-streaming.html">Qobuz</a> trial to help sell you on the concept.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This could be a sweet-sounding system regardless of the audio source. The L75ms includes a pair of 1-inch titanium dome tweeters with wave guides, two 5.25-inch white cone woofers and a 4-inch mid-range driver, all of them with dedicated channels for amp and DSP tuning.  They sit on a &quot;multi-angled&quot; baffle, too. On top of the networking, you&#39;l find a 3.5mm input, a vinyl-friendly moving magnet phono stage and ARC-capable HDMI for connecting to your TV. You can connect an external subwoofer if you need deeper, separated bass.</p><p>The L75ms won&#39;t ship until the fourth quarter of the year, and it won&#39;t be a trivial expense at $1,500. However, it&#39;s also a rare combination of high-res audio, streaming support and a relatively compact design that would look right at home in many living rooms. You might not need much else to get the most out of a premium music service.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jbl-l75ms-hifi-streaming-speaker-145857987.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3d7a2705-5972-49a8-baee-f513c48eed23</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 14:58:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627916339</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T14:59:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d1b01e00-f39c-11eb-bf67-f839fce2061c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d1b01e00-f39c-11eb-bf67-f839fce2061c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JBL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JBL L75ms HiFi speaker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[JBL L75ms HiFi speaker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Apple TV bug is muting some purchased and rented movies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some folks who buy or rent movies on Apple TV are running into a major issue when they watch films through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-app-playstation-4-5-launch-availability-113246540.html">the app</a>.

It&#39;s not as mystical as it sounds, but it could lead to a major change in military and government operations.</p><p>The machine learning-based system observes changes in raw, real-time data that hint at possible trouble. If <a href="https://www.engadget.com/space-xs-next-starlink-launch-will-help-improve-satellite-imagery-of-the-earth-130033228.html">satellite imagery</a> shows signs that a rival nation&#39;s submarine is preparing to leave port, for instance, the AI could flag that mobilization knowing the vessel will likely leave soon. Military analysts can take hours or even days to comb through this information — GIDE technology could send an alert within &quot;seconds,&quot; VanHerck said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The most recent dry run, GIDE 3, was the most expansive yet. It saw all 11 US commands and the broader Defense Department use a mix of military and civilian sensors to address scenarios where &quot;contested logistics&quot; (such as communications in the Panama Canal) might pose a problem. The technology involved wasn&#39;t strictly new, the General said, but the military &quot;stitched everything together.&quot;</p><p>The platform could be put into real-world use relatively soon. VanHerck believed the military was &quot;ready to field&quot; the software, and could validate it at the next Globally Integrated Exercise in spring 2022.</p><p>The advantages of this predictive AI are fairly clear. Instead of merely reacting to events or relying on outdated info, the Pentagon could take proactive steps like deploying forces or ramping up defenses. It could also provide an &quot;opportunity&quot; for the civilian  government, VanHerck added. He didn&#39;t provide examples, but this could help politicians call out acts of aggression while they&#39;re still in the early stages.</p><p>There are still limitations. The AI is looking for out-of-the-ordinary clues, such as a greater number of parked cars or aircraft. It can&#39;t say for certain what&#39;s happening — humans will still be heavily involved. Even so, the tech could be worthwhile if it prevents a &#39;surprise&#39; attack or leads to negotiations instead of conflict.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pentagon-ai-predicts-days-in-advance-135509604.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ccea19f-9ca5-4b16-a40f-4e459cf18d59</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 13:55:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627912407</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T13:53:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Military & Defense]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/073b94a0-f1c4-11e9-8f5b-2c0832cca481" width="2900" height="1537" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/073b94a0-f1c4-11e9-8f5b-2c0832cca481" width="2900" height="1537" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[icholakov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US pentagon building aerial view at sunset]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US Pentagon at sunset]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Klipsch T5 II ANC earbuds use Bragi AI to let you answer calls by nodding]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Klipsch&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/klipsch-t5-ii-t5-ii-sport-true-wireless-earbuds-specs-price-availability-110014906.html">redesigned T5 II</a> true wireless earbuds are a big improvement over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-06-klipsch-t5-true-wireless-earbuds-review.html">the T5</a> that debuted in 2019. However, the company&#39;s 2020 models didn&#39;t offer active noise cancellation (ANC) and only the pricier Sport version had wireless charging. Today, Klipsch is making both of those standard features with <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/t5-ii-true-wireless-anc-earphones">the T5 II ANC</a>, plus it&#39;s throwing in AI-powered features from true wireless pioneer Bragi and Dirac HD Sound. All of the additions make this model a true flagship, right down to the premium price of $299.&nbsp;</p><p>The T5 II ANC has the same design for both the earbuds and the case as the T5 II. The buds were retooled after the original T5 to make them more comfortable. Klipsch still includes six sets of oval silicon ear tips to help you find the best fit, but the T5 II ANC is only IPX4 rated water resistant (compared to the T5 II&#39;s IP67). Inside, the company uses a redesigned 5.8mm driver with a thinner diaphragm that it says improves sound quality across all frequencies.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Klipsch takes the audio profile a step further with some help from Dirac&#39;s HD Sound technology. Dirac is known for its &quot;digital audio optimization,&quot; and in 2020 the company announced plans to both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-dirac-headphone-audio-correction-dsp.html">recalibrate your headphones</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dirac-spatial-audio-headphone-bluetooth-chips-130017379.html">integrate its sound tech directly inside future products</a>. For the T5 II ANC, Klipsch says HD Sound will improve staging, clarity, voice and bass while still allowing you to apply custom EQ settings at you see fit.&nbsp;</p><p>Another key element of the T5 II ANC are the hands-free gestures called Bragi Moves. Bragi was one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-20-bragi-dash-review.html">first companies to build true wireless earbuds</a>, long before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-01-apple-airpods-best-selling-true-wireless-earbuds.html">Apple helped popularize</a> the product category. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-16-bragis-dash-pro-earbuds-ai.html">Dash line of earbuds</a> not only worked better than many of the early options, but they were also packed with more tech: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-02-bragi-dash-update-kinetic-siri-wireless-earbuds.html">gesture controls</a>, on-board music storage, fitness tracking, real-time translation and more. In 2019, Bragi announced that it had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-01-bragi-sells-off-hardware-business.html">sold its hardware business to focus on software and AI</a>. Klipsch is one of the first to integrate the company&#39;s gesture controls, including the ability to answer calls by nodding or to skip tracks by shaking your head. Bragi&#39;s tech will also enable Sidekicks or automated processes like turning on ANC when you listen to music or activating transparency mode when you get a call. Klipsch and Bragi said more features will be available in the future.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4cbde4c0-f33d-11eb-9a7f-a6b8cd3d5e4a" alt="Klipsch T5 II ANC McLaren Edition" data-uuid="401a11af-e932-3b73-a067-2ac248c466ec"><figcaption>Klipsch T5 II ANC McLaren Edition</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Klipsch</div></figure><p>The noise-cancelling setup on the T5 II ANC employs dual microphones on each earbud (feedforward and feedback) to catch as much external distraction as possible. Like the T5, this model also includes a transparency mode so you can tune into your surroundings when needed. Klipsch promises &quot;loud and clear&quot; calls as well, with six beamforming microphones and automatic noise suppression.&nbsp;</p><p>All of those new features led to less battery life. With ANC on, Klipsch says you can muster five hours of listening on the buds themselves. That&#39;s down from eight on the T5 II and T5 II Sport. When you disable the noise-cancelling feature, the company says you can expect two more hours of use. The included case holds 21 additional hours (three full charges) and Qi-compatible wireless charging is on board.&nbsp;</p><p>Like it did with the T5 II Sport, Klipsch is offering <a href="https://www.klipsch.com/products/t5-ii-true-wireless-anc-mclaren-edition-earphones">a McLaren Edition</a> of the T5 II ANC. The company is a sponsor for McLaren&#39;s Formula 1 team, so it&#39;s bringing papaya orange, carbon fiber and a tire tread pattern from the track to your earbuds. This special version carries all of the same features of the regular T5 II ANC, but it comes with a wireless charging pad and it&#39;s equipped with NuCurrent charging tech.

You can currently get the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB model" href="https://amzn.to/37fhSjq">512GB model</a> for $799 at Amazon, or $100 off the normal $899 price. The deal brings the desktop down to just below the record low we saw in March and April. It also means you&#39;re only paying $100 more for double the storage of the $699 base model.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Mac Mini M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $799" href="https://amzn.to/37fhSjq">Buy Mac Mini M1 (512GB) at Amazon - $799</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That should come in handy if you plan to take full advantage of the Mac Mini&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">M1 chip</a>. As we&#39;ve <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">previously</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">noted</a>, Apple&#39;s in-house silicon is a powerhouse that makes quick work of most tasks, be it browsing bloated websites or opening creative editing software. Inside the desktop, you&#39;ll find an 8-core CPU with four performance cores and four efficiency cores and a 16-core Neural Engine. Unlike with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">iMac</a>, you&#39;ll also need your own display and peripherals like a keyboard and mouse.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a few caveats, however. The Mac Mini&#39;s RAM and storage aren&#39;t upgradeable and the two rear Thunderbolt ports won&#39;t please those who need extra monitors and faster connectivity. Apple also offers 16GB unified memory, up to 2TB SSD storage and 10 Gigabit Ethernet support at a cost. In fact, the true top-of-the line Mac Mini will set you back $1,799. Saying that, the specs available on this deal model should please most casual users.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-deal-123413396.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47481a7f-ad42-4da6-ae91-e4a3c9650059</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 12:34:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627907657</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T12:34:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dcba6960-f38b-11eb-bc7f-bf7d76504fdd" width="2880" height="1620" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dcba6960-f38b-11eb-bc7f-bf7d76504fdd" width="2880" height="1620" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Mac Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Mac Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube trials a cheaper 'Premium Lite' subscription that only removes ads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a bid to boost YouTube Premium sign-ups, Google has offered everything from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-mini-youtube-premium-giveaway-143245422.html">free hardware</a> to access to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tubes-experimental-features-now-require-a-paid-premium-account-092633439.html">unique features</a>. Now, it&#39;s going back to basics. The company is testing a lower-priced subscription plan in parts of Europe that gives you ad-free viewing without offline downloads, YouTube Music and background playback. A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/so-youtube-premium-lite-ad-free-sub-is-a-thing-now-in-select-countries.465198/">Resetera user</a> first spotted the new YouTube Premium Lite tier in Netherlands, Finland and Sweden while trying to cancel the paid-for service.&nbsp;</p><p>The plan costs €6.99 ($8.32) per month, the same as the student tier, whereas the normal price is €11.99 ($14.26).

As part of the breakthrough, researchers witnessed and captured the light from the back of a supermassive black hole 800 million light years away.&nbsp;</p><p>The latest breakthrough is a &quot;key part of the puzzle to understanding&quot; how the universe came to be, according to Stanford astrophysicist Dan Wilkins.

An international group of scientists witnessed the echoes using the European Space Agency&#39;s XMM-Newton and NASA’s NuSTAR space telescopes.

Prices in the category can range from $80 to $800 for extras including app-based controls, compatibility with smart assistants like Alexa, access to more data and customization. As part of its first stab at a smart air purifier, IKEA is looking to break into the market by sticking to its hallmarks: Affordability and minimalism.&nbsp;</p><p>The Swedish flatpack giant is releasing two &quot;Starkvind&quot; devices, a floor-standalone air purifier and a side table model, which cost $129 and $189, respectively.

Both IKEA purifiers are identical inside: They contain a three-filter system designed to capture bigger particles like hair and dust; 99.5 percent of smaller airborne particles that measure less than 2.5 micrometers (or one 400th of a millimeter) and dust and pollen; and pollutants like formaldehyde and even bad odors.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/11603c90-ef94-11eb-beff-ad88b5a0ca35" alt="IKEA air purifier" data-uuid="21c79b6a-2c32-3f57-9b5b-95f27372b5db"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure><p>The Starkvind also has five different fan speeds that can be used on their own or controlled and scheduled from the IKEA Home app in conjunction with its TRÅDFRI smart home hub.

Multiple Sky videos reportedly violated rules denying the existence of the new coronavirus or claiming that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were effective treatments.</p><p>The clips didn&#39;t provide &quot;sufficient countervailing context&quot; to indicate the claims were false, YouTube told <em>The Guardian</em>. YouTube warned there was the potential for &quot;real-world harm&quot; from these videos. This just one &quot;strike&quot; against Sky — two more would lead to a permanent channel ban.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sky said it found older videos that broke YouTube&#39;s rules, but rejected claims that any of its hosts denied COVID-19&#39;s existence. The broadcaster&#39;s digital editor alleged that YouTube was threatening free thought, although YouTube is notably focusing on demonstrable facts, not opinions.</p><p>The TV network has come under fire for its stance on COVID-19, particularly from host Alan Jones. He falsely claimed the SARS-CoV-2 virus was &quot;not a pandemic&quot; in 2020, and in July incorrectly maintained that the virus&#39; Delta variant was neither dangerous nor affected by vaccines. An uproar over those last statements prompted Sky to make a formal apology on July 19th, removing the relevant video at the same time.</p><p>The suspension won&#39;t dramatically damage Sky&#39;s Australian revenue. It&#39;s still rare for YouTube to take that kind of action against a major media network, though. The move also sends a signal — large outlets can&#39;t count on their size to shield them against YouTube crackdowns.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-sky-news-australia-ban-covid-misinformation-213810128.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3333b100-94c4-4f83-a01f-550665d4d898</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 21:38:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627853892</ingested><modified>2021-08-01T21:38:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/3604f560-f426-11e9-af36-2c4361ae4716" width="5315" height="3533" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/3604f560-f426-11e9-af36-2c4361ae4716" width="5315" height="3533" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - JUNE 4: Detail of the YouTube logo outside the YouTube Space studios in London, taken on June 4, 2019.

The preliminary settlement also requires tougher security measures, such as warning about participants with third-party apps and offering special privacy-oriented training to Zoom staff.</p><p>Judge Lucy Koh said the company was largely protected against zoombombing claims thanks to the Communications Decency Act&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html">Section 230</a> safeguards against liability for users&#39; actions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The settlement could also lead to payouts if the lawsuit achieves a proposed class action status, but don&#39;t expect a windfall. Subscribers would receive a refund of either 15 percent or $25, whichever was larger, while everyone else would receive as much as $15. Lawyers intended to collect up to $21.25 million in legal costs.</p><p>In a statement, Zoom denied doing anything wrong and said that privacy and security were &quot;top priorities.&quot; The company previously agreed to settle a Federal Trade Commission complaint over similar privacy issues, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-zoom-will-remove-server-behind-mac-security-hole.html">permanent web server</a> it installed on Macs.</p><p>Zoom <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-02-zoom-user-trust-privacy-security-review.html">scrambled to bolster security</a> for its video chats after a surge in pandemic-related use drew attention to vulnerabilities in its software and services.  It started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-rollout-183517995.html">rolling out end-to-end encryption</a> in October 2020, conducted reviews and made zoombombing more difficult.

However, it does mark a rare instance of Google cutting off basic functionality for older Android versions, not just OS updates or Play Services features. Think of this as Google setting a baseline — you&#39;ll need a device updated within the last decade to receive at least rudimentary support.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-ends-sign-in-support-for-old-android-versions-193130157.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c1f143b-3987-4d73-be2c-c77b5fd8533e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 19:31:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627846295</ingested><modified>2021-08-01T19:31:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd178780-f2f6-11eb-bfeb-1599d11a478b" width="3499" height="2331" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd178780-f2f6-11eb-bfeb-1599d11a478b" width="3499" height="2331" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[- via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mario Queiroz, Vice President of Product Management for Google, holds up the Nexus One smartphone running on the Google Android platform, the first mobile phone the internet company will sell directly to consumers, during a news conference at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California on January 5, 2010.

It likely made a small number of titanium Apple Watches and stopped production &quot;months ago&quot; in anticipation of switching focus to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">Series 7</a>, according to Gurman, but ran out prematurely as sales remained relatively strong.

The tech giant has frequently shaken up its Watch Edition strategy, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-07-apple-killed-off-its-super-expensive-gold-edition-watches.html">ditching its solid gold originals</a> in favor of more affordable ceramic and, eventually, titanium. It might decide that the costs of manufacturing upscale watches doesn&#39;t justify the comparatively meager sales. There&#39;s always the Hermès models if you want to splurge. At the same time, though, titanium versions don&#39;t cost that much more in practice — and they might serve as halo watches that attract conventional watch enthusiasts as well as the wealthy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-edition-titanium-unavailable-152716696.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea95d0cd-7e81-4496-8f1d-7a6bbae80495</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 15:27:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627831638</ingested><modified>2021-08-01T15:27:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4fb75f00-f2d7-11eb-87d6-2bc8adbc1d28" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4fb75f00-f2d7-11eb-87d6-2bc8adbc1d28" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Edition Series 6 in titanium]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Edition Series 6 in titanium]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Over 100 warship locations have been faked in one year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/police-get-google-location-data-george-floyd-protests-183114536.html">Abuses of location technology</a> might just result in hot political disputes. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fake-warships-ais-signals-russia-crimea/">According</a> to <em>Wired, </em>SkyWatch and Global Fishing Watch have <a href="https://skytruth.org/2021/07/systematic-data-analysis-reveals-false-vessel-tracks/">conducted</a> studies showing that over 100 warship locations have been faked since August 2020, including the British aircraft carrier <em>Queen Elizabeth</em> and the US destroyer <em>Roosevelt</em>. In some cases, the false data showed the vessels entering disputed waters or nearing other countries&#39; naval bases — movements that could spark international incidents.</p><p>The research team found the fakes by comparing uses of the automatic identification system (AIS, a GPS-based system to help prevent collisions) with verifiable position data by using an identifying pattern. All of the false info came from shore-based AIS receivers while satellites showed the real positions, for instance. Global Fishing Watch had been investigating fake AIS positions for years, but this was the first time it had seen falsified data for real ships.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not certain who&#39;s faking locations and why. However, analysts said the data was characteristic of a common perpetrator that might be Russia. Almost all of the affected warships were from European countries or NATO members, and the data included bogus incursions around Kaliningrad, the Black Sea, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-apple-to-review-disputed-borders-in-maps.html">Crimea</a> and other Russian interests. In theory, Russia could portray Europe and NATO as aggressors by falsely claiming those rivals sent warships into Russian seas.</p><p>Russia has historically denied hacking claims. It has a years-long history of using fake accounts and misinformation to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-25-russia-linked-facebook-ads-exploited-social-divisions.html">stoke political tensions</a> that further its own ends, though. And if Russia is connected, the faked warship locations might be a significant escalation of that strategy. Even though such an approach might not lead to shooting matches, it could get disconcertingly close.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/warship-fake-locations-221800228.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99a37a83-edd4-47d8-8fc4-88cdbf618195</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 22:18:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627906495</ingested><modified>2021-08-02T12:15:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/63697eb0-f247-11eb-bd7f-00dcafc086fa" width="4541" height="3027" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/63697eb0-f247-11eb-bd7f-00dcafc086fa" width="4541" height="3027" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Murad Sezer / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[U.S. Navy Arleigh-Burke class destroyer USS Roosevelt (DDG 80) sets sail in the Bosphorus, returning from the Black Sea, in Istanbul, Turkey October 2, 2020.

The <em>New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/science/lunar-rover-apollo-nasa.html">noted</a> that July 31st, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1421173756458831875">marks</a> the 50th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-across-the-airless-wilds-earl-smith-custom-house-153003777.html">Lunar Roving Vehicle&#39;s</a> first outing — and the first time people drove on the Moon. Apollo 15 astronauts Dave Scott and Jim Irwin took the car on a stint to collect samples and explore the lunar surface more effectively than they could on foot.</p><p>Scott and Irwin would eventually drive the rover two more times (for a total of three hours) before returning to Earth. The Apollo 16 and 17 missions each had an LRV of their own. There was also a fourth rover, but it was used for spare parts after the cancellation of Apollo 18 and further missions. All three serving models remained on the Moon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Early development was problematic, in no small part due to the lack of real-world testing conditions. They couldn&#39;t exactly conduct a real-world test drive, after all. The team eventually settled on a collapsible design with steel mesh wheels that could safely handle the Moon&#39;s low gravity, lack of atmosphere, extreme temperatures and soft soil.</p><p>The LRV was modest, with a 57-mile range, four 0.19kW motors and an official top speed of 8MPH. It was also expensive, with cost overruns bringing the price of four rovers to $38 million (about $249 million in 2021 dollars). It was key to improved scientific exploration during the later stages of the Apollo program, though, and it was also an early example of a practical electric vehicle — humans were using a battery-powered ride on the Moon decades before the technology became mainstream on Earth.</p><p>We wouldn&#39;t count on humans driving on the Moon any time soon, although that reflects the progress made in the 50 years since. NASA and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-17-china-yutu2-discovered-moon-mantle-material.html">other space agencies</a> are now focused on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-astrobotic-lunar-cube-rover-165307453.html">robotic rovers</a> that can explore the Moon without worries about crew safety. Those humans that do go on rides will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-gm-lockheed-martin-artemis-vehicle-131521711.html">likely use autonomous vehicles</a>.

Rivian has just one factory, a former Mitsubishi plant in Illinois, and it only just unveiled plans for a second American facility that might also produce batteries.

The UK intends to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-04-uk-ban-petrol-diesel-hybrid-cars-2035.html">ban sales of combustion engine cars</a> in 2035, and that means switching local production to EVs.
