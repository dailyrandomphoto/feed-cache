But now you can get one of Shark&#39;s most advanced models for the lowest price we&#39;ve seen. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum" href="https://amzn.to/3GxOMfs">Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum</a> with clean base is 47 percent off, bringing it down to $319. That&#39;s more than $280 off its normal price and the lowest we&#39;ve seen it — not to mention that also makes it even cheaper than most iRobot devices that come with clean bases, even when they&#39;ve been on sale.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GxOMfs" id="6372afd8974f4916b8e5ff731b09b34f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Shark IQ RV1001AE at Amazon - $319</a><p>We&#39;ve been fans of Shark&#39;s robot vacuums since one of its cheaper models made it into our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a>. Originally priced at $600, the RV1001AE is one of Shark&#39;s higher-end robo-vacs with powerful suction and a self-cleaning brush roll. The latter ensures that hair won&#39;t get tangled in the brush, making this vacuum a good pick for pet owners. In addition to Shark&#39;s IQ navigation, it also maps out your home as it cleans so you can tell it to only clean the living room or the kitchen by using the mobile app. And if you don&#39;t want to bother with manual cleanings, you can set a schedule in the mobile app, too, and let the robot do all the work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This robot vacuum also cleans itself — it&#39;ll automatically empty its bin into the clean base that comes with it. Yes, you&#39;ll have to empty the base once every month or so, but that&#39;s much more convenient than having to remember to dump out the robot&#39;s contents every time. Also, Shark&#39;s clean base is bagless, so you don&#39;t have to buy proprietary liners like you do with other robots that come with similar bases.</p><p>If you can live without the clean base, a few other <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark vacuums" href="https://amzn.to/3vWWPh5">Shark vacuums</a> — both robot and not — are on sale right now, too. Of note is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark IQ AV970" href="https://amzn.to/3BoERVK">Shark IQ AV970</a>, which is down to $250. That&#39;s $150 off its normal price and close to its all-time low of $230. It has many of the same features as the RV1001AE, including a self-cleaning brush roll, IQ navigation and Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Aside from the clean base, you&#39;ll have to forgo home mapping with this model, but you&#39;ll get an extra-large dust bin, which allows the robot to suck up more dirt and debris before you need to empty it.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3BoERVK" id="48ede0ab78f840b4a37e423b3a503408" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Shark IQ AV970 at Amazon - $250</a><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sharks-self-emptying-robot-vacuum-is-nearly-half-off-today-133007846.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cdeb78bd-041e-4ff6-b4e3-bce586036334</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 13:30:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635425424</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T12:50:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8c41330-37ec-11ec-b3f1-fb67d2b61a26" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8c41330-37ec-11ec-b3f1-fb67d2b61a26" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shark]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[McDonald's and IBM could bring AI-powered drive-thrus to more restaurants]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>McDonald&#39;s might not be the only restaurant experimenting with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-10-mcdonald-plans-to-bring-ai-voice-technology-to-its-drive-thrus.html">AI-based order taking</a> in the near future. <em>Restaurant Dive</em><a href="https://www.restaurantdive.com/news/mcdonalds-will-sell-mcd-tech-labs-to-ibm/608978/">reports</a> McDonald&#39;s is <a href="https://corporate.mcdonalds.com/corpmcd/en-us/our-stories/article/ourstories.IBM-McD-Tech-Labs.html">selling</a> its McD Tech Labs to IBM in order to &quot;further accelerate&quot; work on its automated voice ordering systems.

It&#39;s <a href="https://www.nikon.com/news/2021/1028_mirrorless_01.htm">Nikon&#39;s first camera</a> to use a stacked sensor with built in memory that allows for very fast readout speeds. In fact, Nikon is so confident in the electronic shutter that it has abandoned the mechanical shutter entirely, so the Z9 is the first high-end professional camera without one.</p><p>With that high-speed sensor (which has the same megapixel count as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikon-z7-ii-review-140054141.html">Z7 II</a>), the Z9 allows a flash sync of up to 1/200th of a second, which looks like the fastest sync speed ever for an electronic shutter. That should also make it very resistant to rolling shutter, which is crucial if the camera is to be used for sports or action photography.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The faster sensor allows JPEG burst shooting at up to 30 fps, or RAW photos at 20 fps. If you&#39;re willing to drop down to 11 megapixels, you can shoot photos at an astounding 120 fps. As with other stacked sensor cameras, the Nikon Z has much improved buffering, letting you capture up to 1,000 frames at once with either JPEG or the new HE (high efficiency) RAW compression algorithms.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9041d3a0-37ee-11ec-9d7f-3ffb91bd348b" alt="Nikon officially unveils the 45.7-megapixel Z9 with 8K video and 20 fps burst speeds" data-uuid="60437871-cff7-3b83-971e-066ba17897fe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>Nikon&#39;s autofocus (AF) system is also all-new, and makes even more extensive use of AI algorithms. Much like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canons-24-megapixel-eos-r-3-can-shoot-raw-photos-at-30-fps-100003365.html">Canon&#39;s EOS R3</a>, it can now track a wide range of subjects, including the eyes, faces and bodies of people, along with dogs, cats and birds, planes, trains, motorbike and bicycles. And unlike other AI cameras, there&#39;s no need to tell it what you&#39;re shooting — the camera will figure that out if you set it to &quot;Auto&quot; (or, you can set the subject type manually). It also offers a &quot;3D tracking&quot; system much like you can find on Nikon&#39;s DSLRs. All of this falls into line with the Z9&#39;s purpose as a sports/action/wildlife photography camera.</p><p>Nikon has also improved its in-body stabilization system (which it calls &quot;vibration reduction&quot; or VR). Now, it can combine in-body and lens stabilization system for steadier video or fewer blurry photos. This will only be available with several lenses to begin with, however, namely the Nikkor Z 70-200m F/2.8, Z MC 105mm f/2.8 VR and freshly announced Z 100-400mm F/4.5-5.6 VR S.&nbsp;</p><p>Video performance is equally impressive, as Nikon teased <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikons-z-9-with-8-k-video-capability-is-set-to-arrive-later-this-year-080539577.html">earlier this year</a>. The Z3 will be able to capture 8K at 30p at launch, along with oversampled 4K 30p from an 8K capture that should be incredibly sharp. If you don&#39;t mind pixel binning or line skipping, it will also be able to capture 4K at up to 120 fps.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="77040aec-9604-4f9c-8a84-61170e1f15d3"/><p>To start with, you&#39;ll be able to capture these formats at up to 10-bit with H.264 or H.265 long GOP codecs. On top of that, Nikon is offering the very useful option of capturing video with ProRes 422 HQ compression, which is much easier to edit straight out of the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Things will get even more interesting later on, though. Nikon plans to introduce a future firmware update that will enable 12-bit 8K 60fps capture in a new, proprietary N-RAW format or using Apple ProRes RAW HQ capture at 4K/60p. Nikon promises that you&#39;ll be able to capture the oversampled 4K/30p for more than two hours at &quot;normal&quot; temperatures.&nbsp;</p><p>The Z9 has a large pro-style body with controls about where you&#39;d expect them, other than a repositioned play button and AF button near the front. It uses dual CFexpress Type B slots (backward compatible with XQD) for maximum performance for video and burst photos. The new large, EN-EL18d battery is rated for up to 740 shots per charge with the LCD, or 700 shots with the EVF enabled.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/31f75680-37ee-11ec-bbf2-6c1cd8c748a7" alt="Nikon officially unveils the 45.7-megapixel Z9 with 8K video and 20 fps burst speeds" data-uuid="03854cbc-249c-311d-8db3-a17e8f5a5f10"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nikon</div></figure><p>It has a 3.69 million dot OLED viewfinder with just a 60 fps refresh rate, but Nikon said that it always delivers that speed and never downgrades it no matter what you&#39;re doing. It uses a multi-direction rear LCD and not a fully-articulating screen, but you can tilt t he screen up to face yourself.</p><p>With the Z9, Nikon has taken some of the best aspects of Canon&#39;s EOS R3 and the Sony A1 and married them into a single, large body. It falls a bit short of those models in terms of shooting speed, and the electronic viewfinder isn&#39;t too impressive on paper. However, Nikon seems to have vaulted ahead of both Sony and Canon in terms of video specs, particularly when the firmware update arrives — though we&#39;ll have to wait and see if video autofocus is up to snuff.

Its latest software update <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/27/tesla-launches-remote-sentry-mode-live-view-premium-connectivity-feature/">includes</a> a feature called Sentry Mode Live Camera Access, which will allow owners to remotely view their car&#39;s surroundings when parked. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-09-teslas-sentry-mode-has-already-caught-a-suspected-carjacker.html">Sentry Mode</a> is Tesla&#39;s integrated surveillance system that uses a 360 dash cam to record damage and any attempted break-in. It has resulted to arrests of people who attempted to steal Teslas in the past, but owners haven&#39;t been able to use it to view their car&#39;s current surroundings until now.</p><p>In its update notes, Tesla says the live camera function is end-to-end encrypted and cannot be accessed by the company. To enable or disable it, owners need to go under Safety &amp; Security in Controls. According to <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/27/tesla-launches-remote-sentry-mode-live-view-premium-connectivity-feature/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, however, owners must have an active <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-07-tesla-starts-charging-for-premium-connectivity.html">Premium Connectivity</a> subscription to activate live view. The subscription package gives them access to satellite maps and live traffic visualizations, as well as media streaming and web browsing on data. It does cost $10 a month, but owners can sign up for free trial before paying for the service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At this point in time, live camera is only available to iOS users who can view the footage around their cars via Tesla&#39;s app. The automaker has unfortunately yet to announce when its Android app will also get the capability.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-sentry-mode-live-view-091026473.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb29c7a7-e2d4-4aed-ab5c-28eaa3390aec</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 09:10:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635408644</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T08:10:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/38c3c450-0a2e-11ec-afef-cb72bb49b07f" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/38c3c450-0a2e-11ec-afef-cb72bb49b07f" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[winhorse via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hong Kong - August 13, 2021 : People walk past the Tesla official showroom in Queens Road East, Wan Chai, Hong Kong.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Showroom in Hong Kong]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony has sold 13.4 million PS5s]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony&#39;s PlayStation 5 sales remain relatively steady and strong, despite widespread supply shortages, with 3.3 million units sold in fiscal Q2 compared to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-ps5-10-million-sold-144729654.html">2.2 million last quarter</a>. That brought total sales up to 13.4 million units, Sony <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/archive.html">announced</a>. Game sales were also up significantly at 76.4 million units compared to 63.6 million in the previous quarter, due in large part to third-party sales.</p><p>All told, this amounted to a healthy 27 percent boost in gaming revenue to 645.4 billion yen ($5.68 billion). However, operating income of 82.7 billion yen ($728 million) was down compared to last quarter by 3.4 billion yen ($29 million). Sony&#39;s fiscal year ends on March 31, 2022.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So how can profit be lower when sales and revenue are up? While Sony did sell more games last quarter, first-party titles dropped very significantly, from 10.5 million last quarter to 7.6 million in Q2. That was offset in numbers by third-party games, but those don&#39;t tend to be as profitable. Both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-buys-zenimax-bethesda-id-arkane-131006192.html">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-19-sony-interactive-snaps-up-spider-man-developer-insomniac-games.html">Sony</a> have acquired gaming studios to boost their Xbox/PS first-party titles, but Microsoft has been more prolific in that regard.&nbsp;</p><p>And while PS5 sales were up, PS4 units dropped considerably, down to just 200,000 from a half a million the quarter before. Other factors that Sony mentioned are a &quot;loss resulting from strategic price points for PS5 hardware that were set lower than manufacturing costs.&quot; That means that Sony may have sold the PS5 with minimal or negative profits this quarter as it attempted to navigate around chip shortages. However, in August, the company said it was <a href="https://www.vg247.com/ps5-no-longer-selling-at-a-loss">no longer</a> selling the PS5 at a loss.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the drop in quarterly income, Sony&#39;s gaming division appears to be on pretty solid footing. In its August earnings call, Sony CFO Hiroki Totoki told investors that its PS5 sales target is set higher than the 14.8 million unit sales achieved by the PlayStation 4 in its first year. Based on today&#39;s figures, PS5 sales are closely tracking that trajectory.</p><p>The company also said at the time that it had secured enough components for 22.6 million units sold by March 2022. That would be enough to meet its sales projections, but if sales really explode during the holidays, it may not have a lot of margin for error — meaning shortages could continue through next year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-has-sold-134-million-ps5s-084114658.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2bab9ba0-b9da-4144-a72f-827bbb38dd55</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 08:41:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635420718</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T11:32:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/58115730-37c1-11ec-bfba-667c8280e1fd" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/58115730-37c1-11ec-bfba-667c8280e1fd" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony has sold 13.4 million PS5s]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony has sold 13.4 million PS5s]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Star Trek: Prodigy’ centers technology by focusing on those who don’t have it]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains moderate spoilers for the first episode and slight spoilers for episode two of ‘</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Star Trek: Prodigy" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/n12OYa"><em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em></a><em>.’</em></p><p>How do you make a series that can draw in newcomers while still appealing to long-time fans?

The idea is to keep Star Trek fans from dropping their subscriptions to Paramount+ during the downtime, something that was fairly common during <em>Discovery</em>’s first three seasons.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ef1a9730-3763-11ec-b5fe-7dc4933d8c37" style="height:1202;width:2910;" alt="Pictured: Environmental coverage of the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Prodigy .

And that’s where the deeper ties to Trek lore come in. Though Voyager spent seven years in the Delta Quadrant, the ship’s mission to get back to Federation space meant it couldn’t stick around in any one place too long, or return to previous locales. There’s a ton left to explore — as well as plenty of room for Prodigy’s creators, Dan and Kevin Hageman, to populate their own corner of the universe.</p><p>First, they have to introduce their main characters, and that’s what ‘Lost and Found’ is largely dedicated to doing. Our cast of misfits, led by Dal (voiced by Brett Gray), lives on a mining colony populated by prisoners and orphans. It’s the last place anyone would want to be, especially a Star Trek character, which is why the main drive is to just get off this bleak rock. But right away the series makes its point about being far from Federation space and technology, as the inhabitants can’t even talk to each other due to a lack of universal translators. That system has been how, for over 55 years, Star Trek has managed to populate its cast with aliens who all speak English. It’s the future! Different languages aren’t a problem!</p><div id="6ded429095d343f49f76765bc22e338f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y-1VLAt_UjU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Except here, they are. It keeps the characters from even knowing each other’s names, which makes the discovery of the <em>USS Protostar</em> and its built-in translator the perfect opportunity for everyone to re-introduce themselves to each other and thus, to the audience. And, when Dal and Rocktok discover a lost Starfleet ship buried under the surface of the planet, the ship itself may fill them with awe, but it’s the translator that truly elicits the most enthusiastic reaction: Rocktok calls it “magic.” It’s a rather fitting introduction to a franchise with a goal to “seek out new life and new civilizations,” in how it puts the connection between these disparate aliens up front.</p><p>When I saw the pilot at New York Comic Con <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-first-look-183049340.html">a few weeks ago</a>, I compared it to shows like <em>Clone Wars</em> and <em>Rebels</em>. The Star Wars influence that J.J. Abrams brought to the Star Trek franchise is still present in <em>Prodigy</em>, notably in its action sequences and score, the latter composed by frequent Michael Giacchino collaborator Nami Melumad. Giacchino is best known for his work on various Pixar and Star Trek films, and he also supplies the main theme for <em>Prodigy</em>. You can hear his influence on Melumad’s score, which does a great job of blending a quirky style with the signature Trek leitmotifs.</p><div id="5654405eac214090b0555ebfac963ae8"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bm9Zv8D70hA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The final action sequence feels like pure Star Wars, as the <em>USS Protostar</em> makes its way off the planet and Dal is trapped on its hull, battling the villainous Drednok. The bad guy’s insect-like cyborg body reminds me of General Grievous — if the general could turn into a giant gun, that is. It’s the kind of thing that works best in CG and, like <em>Lower Decks</em> before it, <em>Prodigy</em> seems more than willing to embrace the extra freedom offered by animation as a medium. We’re long past the clunky microfiche displays and <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Unnamed_non-humanoids_(23rd_century)#Alfa_177_canine">cosplaying dogs</a> of the original series.</p><p>That freedom is probably best illustrated in the character of hologram Captain Janeway, voiced by Kate Mulgrew (of course). It’s been over 20 years since <em>Voyager</em> last graced the small screen, and Mulgrew has kept busy on shows like <em>Warehouse 13</em> and <em>Orange is the New Black</em>. But in the Star Trek universe, it’s only been six years (though an exact date is never given on-screen in <em>Prodigy</em>). Animation means they can easily erase the decades from Janeway without resorting to the creepy live-action simulacrums seen in <em>Rogue One</em> of Moff Tarkin and Princess Leia.</p><div id="75b15dc6009244ccb45c9541f1791597"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lp2MfWFF2Wk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Hologram Janeway makes her debut at the end of today’s pilot episode, but she’ll make a much fuller appearance in next week’s ‘Starstruck.’ That’s where the new “cadets” get to explore the ship and learn more about the distant “Federation.” While there’s still plenty of banter and conflict between the characters, the real star of the second episode is the ship itself — what it looks like, and what it’s capable of. While there is a plot — which I won’t divulge details of — it serves as a showcase for all the different features of this new prototype ship. You can almost imagine Janeway as a car salesman, slapping the hood of the <em>Protostar</em> and saying “this baby’s warp core can travel to so many planets.”</p><p>Star Trek has always been a humanist franchise, devoted to exploring social themes and dilemmas. It also has a tendency to take its technology and the “post-scarcity utopia” for granted. <em>Prodigy</em> goes against the grain by showing from the start how technology can change lives.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-first-episode-lost-and-found-070033462.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28afb0c2-e566-46b9-b5b0-81b41cc36261</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 07:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635367336</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T20:42:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3509a530-3762-11ec-bfff-73234ee97e27" width="2910" height="1308" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3509a530-3762-11ec-bfff-73234ee97e27" width="2910" height="1308" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nickelodeon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pictured: Environmental coverage of the Paramount+ series Star Trek: Prodigy .

That&#39;s 10 percent higher from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-q3-2020-012410766.html">same period</a> last year. It also reported an operating profit of 15.82 trillion Korean won or U$13.5 billion, which is 26 percent higher than the previous quarter&#39;s.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the pandemic, the tech giant&#39;s semiconductor business posted 26.4 trillion won or US$22.6 billion in revenue, thanks to a strong demand for computers due to companies implementing work-from-home arrangements. Its DRAM sales, mainly for servers, continue to grow and is the leading factor for the division&#39;s stellar performance. Samsung says it was able to do business as usual despite the global shortage in chip components &quot;by flexibly operating its product mix.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to its chip business, Samsung&#39;s mobile division also contributed greatly to its record-breaking third quarter. It saw an improvement from the previous quarter, with its 28.42 trillion won or U$24.2 billion in revenue, thanks to strong sales of its mass-market lineup and its flagship models. The latter includes its new foldable devices, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-drops-to-850-at-amazon-samsung-week-deals-143712131.html">Galaxy Z Flip 3</a>, though the company admitted that the bigger marketing investments for its foldables affected the division&#39;s total profits.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s also thanks to the high demand for its phones that Samsung&#39;s display business was able to post 8.86 trillion won or US$7.5 billion in revenue. Display earnings were up from the previous quarter primarily due to the higher demand for small to medium OLED panels despite a sluggish demand for bigger panels.</p><p>Samsung remains optimistic for the fourth quarter, as well as for next year, but it didn&#39;t provide specific guidance for its chip business due to the ongoing component supply issue affecting various industries. It expects continued high demand for PCs and servers, nonetheless. For the fourth quarter specifically, it&#39;s expecting even higher earnings &quot;due to expanded supply of SoCs and related products for launches of new 5G smartphones in 2022.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-q3-earnings-chip-mobile-record-high-030342880.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83f6b95f-9f4c-4683-a1a2-39b51c55038d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 04:10:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635394309</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T04:11:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/11a79e70-d24b-11eb-be8f-cf4a23cb519b" width="4074" height="2716" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/11a79e70-d24b-11eb-be8f-cf4a23cb519b" width="4074" height="2716" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JHVEPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toronto, Canada - May 16, 2020: Samsung store at Eaton Centre in Toronto, Canada.

The newly <a href="https://media.mbusa.com/releases/release-e803d79216fbe40bc5b04c733e09d303-the-mercedes-benz-sustaineer-an-innovation-driver-for-sustainable-urban-mobility">unveiled</a> Sustaineer delivery van concept is fully electric, as you&#39;d guess, but it also improves the environment around it. Fine particulate filters on the front and underbody purify the air around the van no matter what its speed. It even uses cast iron, ceramic-coated disc brakes that both reduce the amount of dust in the air and limit brake wear.</p><p>The Sustaineer also has solar panels on its roof to extend range and  reduce the need for plug-in charging (this sometimes contributes to CO2 emissions). It can further power devices whether or not the van is running, such as tools and laptops. Solar power on electrified vehicles is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-12-26-fisker-raises-karma-plug-in-hybrid-base-price-to-95-900-brings.html">nothing new</a>, but Mercedes clearly hopes implementations like this would keep EVs as green as possible.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Other eco-conscious technology includes an energy-saving heating system that hews close to the body (including the seatbelt) and a heavy use of recycled materials. The filler is made from household waste, the cab partition is built from natural straw and the underbody includes recycled polypropylene and used tires. Mercedes lowers noise pollution, too, thanks to a quiet electric drivetrain, low rolling resistance tires and a hushed automatic delivery door.</p><p>Safety is a concern as well. A camera monitors road conditions to share reports of potholes and other hazards with cities, while digital mirrors provide a clearer field of view than you normally get with cargo vans. A &quot;biologically active&quot; light keeps the driver alert by filling the cab with illumination similar to daylight while maintaining a natural rhythm.</p><p>There are no mentions of plans to mass-produce the Sustaineer. With that said, Mercedes stressed that all the van&#39;s technology was crafted with large-scale production in mind. You might see this in other vans, not to mention other Mercedes vehicles. The company already has other green tech on the horizon, such as sustainable repairs for EV batteries in 2022, and Sustaineer is ultimately a logical extension of those plans.</p><div id="e505d0933d35491496070d00b00a7601"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K6jazJy425o?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-sustaineer-electric-delivery-van-concept-215050891.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">65ef94cb-fabc-489e-b6a9-df9aba6cef19</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 21:50:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635370266</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T21:31:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/58b71c70-3766-11ec-b9ff-5fb3824b8b74" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/58b71c70-3766-11ec-b9ff-5fb3824b8b74" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mercedes Sustaineer electric delivery van concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mercedes Sustaineer electric delivery van concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zelda-like 'Death's Door' heads to PlayStation and Switch on November 23rd]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Death&#39;s Door</em>, one of the best indie games to come out earlier this year, is heading to PlayStation consoles.

The automaker has <a href="https://www.volvogroup.com/en/news-and-media/news/2021/oct/news-4100018.html">unveiled</a> an autonomous wheel loader prototype, the LX03, that&#39;s based on a Lego model — 42081 Lego Technic Concept Wheel Loader Zeux, if you&#39;re looking for it.

Volvo can make &quot;just one or two changes&quot; to produce a larger or smaller loader to meet a customer&#39;s demands.

Specifically, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-zhurong-rover-selfie-photo-212920780.html">China&#39;s selfie-taking Zhurong rover</a>, which has been on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cnsa-zhurong-rover-095207429.html">Red Planet since May</a>, will try to shoot data over to the ESA&#39;s Mars Express Orbiter.&nbsp;</p><p>As the<a href="https://blogs.esa.int/mex/2021/10/27/mars-express-keeps-an-ear-out-for-chinese-rover/"> ESA explains</a>, Zhurong can&#39;t actually receive any communications from the Express Orbiter, due to a radio incompatibility. That means it can&#39;t hear the hail signal sent from the orbiter, which is typically what a rover waits for before it starts sending out data. Instead, next month Mars and the ESA will attempt a new method that&#39;s previously only been tested on Earth. During five tests, Zhurong will send a signal blindly into space, and the Mars Express will listen for that signal and any potential data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;If [Mars Express] detects the magic signal, the radio will lock on to it and begin recording any data,&quot; <a href="https://blogs.esa.int/mex/2021/10/27/mars-express-keeps-an-ear-out-for-chinese-rover/">ESA&#39;s Josh Tapley writes</a>. &quot;At the end of the communication window, the spacecraft will turn to face Earth and relay these data across space the same way it does for other scientific Mars missions. When the data arrive at ESOC, they will be forwarded on to the Zhurong team for processing and analysis.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s not unusual for rovers to send data to foreign orbiter — that&#39;s commonly been seen as a smart backup method — but this test opens the door for communication between incompatible systems. That&#39;ll be useful if China has any issues with its Tianwen-1 orbiter down the line, or if the US and other countries need help in turn.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/esa-mars-express-china-zhurong-rover-test-190629849.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a59b8ee-55f6-44c9-8f8e-6229a2011956</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 19:06:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635363064</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T19:31:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/036ed3c0-3757-11ec-bdb6-4770ac15da6d" width="1200" height="498" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/036ed3c0-3757-11ec-bdb6-4770ac15da6d" width="1200" height="498" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CNSA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[China's Zhurong rover and Tianwen-1 lander]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[China's Zhurong rover and Tianwen-1 lander]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Olympus cameras will be rebranded as OM System]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/olympus/"><ins>Olympus cameras</ins></a> are getting a new name.

The cost is lower too, at $1,400, compared with the Onewheel+ XR&#39;s starting price of $1,799. It&#39;s more expensive than the $950 Onewheel Pint.

The company designed the board from scratch, and it includes a new control system with a higher voltage. That, according to Future Motion, will deliver more power, torque and dynamic performance at all speeds. In fact, it&#39;s the first three-horsepower Onewheel.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2ba2ed00-3689-11ec-bdfb-639b04e51d09" alt="Onewheel GT" data-uuid="87885ac1-9ff9-3e20-853e-b12f4c60969f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Future Motion</div></figure><p>A new battery system will keep the Onewheel GT rolling for up to 32 miles on a single charge, the company claims. Elsewhere, Future Motion says the built-in Maghandle Pro and LED headlights are over 300 percent brighter than lighting in other models, so the GT might be more viable for nighttime rides. The footpads might be more comfortable too, since they&#39;re concave on both sides. In addition, there&#39;s a version with a treaded tire for increased traction.</p><p>The Onewheel GT is also available starting today, but a premium product means a higher price. It starts at $2,200. However, Future Motion is sweetening the deal for the first 48 hours with promotional offers such as bundle savings up to $275, free fenders and free priority shipping to the lower 48 states.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/onewheel-gt-pint-x-future-motion-180021707.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0e65bfb8-69e1-45a6-a571-7d4edf4c4dc8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 18:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635359514</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T18:31:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/598af0a0-3689-11ec-af7d-20caf4cdfc2d" width="5884" height="3393" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/598af0a0-3689-11ec-af7d-20caf4cdfc2d" width="5884" height="3393" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Motion]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Onewheel GT and Pint X]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Onewheel GT and Pint X]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US Copyright Office provides a path to allow for more device repairs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The right to repair movement just got a big boost from the US Copyright Office. Responding to proposals from a variety of organizations, including the <a href="https://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Right-to-Repair/Intro">iFixit</a>, the office on Wednesday recommended new exemptions to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1201">Section 1201</a> of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act as it relates to the repair of consumer electronics. The statute prohibits the circumvention of software copy protection and has been the target of right to repair advocates for years.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747310/us-copyright-office-dmca-section-1201-exemption-rulemaking-report"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the Copyright Office <a href="https://cdn.loc.gov/copyright/1201/2021/2021_Section_1201_Registers_Recommendation.pdf">recommends</a> additional protections for many consumer-facing devices that rely on software to function. As one example, it adopts a recommendation from Public Knowledge and iFixit that involves video game consoles. It says “the repair of software-enabled consumer devices is likely to be fair use, the Register finds that certain video game console repair is also likely fair use.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It notes consumers can access the firmware on their systems as long as it’s with the intention of fixing the device’s optical drive and they restore any protective measures afterward. The rulemaking stops short of protecting non-consumer devices. However, the Library of Congress has <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-23311.pdf">signed off on the recommendations</a>, paving the way for them to go into effect on October 28th. In a statement to Engadget, the EFF applauded the decision but said Congress needs to modify Section 1201.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The new rules enacted by the Librarian of Congress represent a victory for security research, accessibility, education, preservation, and repair. While the exemptions do continue to contain unnecessary and harmful limitations, we&#39;re pleased with the additional freedom to operate that the Librarian granted in this rulemaking. The largest disappointment, however, is that the agency failed to protect the public&#39;s ability to make non-infringing modifications of device software as we requested. This kind of user innovation has been a profoundly important driver of advances in technology and lets communities who are not served by a technology&#39;s default functions to customize them to their own needs. We are also mindful that the rulemaking process is inherently limited: while the Librarian can authorize people to engage in circumvention, they cannot create exemptions to the part of the law (Section 1201(a)(2)) that prohibits the dissemination of the technology needed to achieve circumvention. Congress needs to remove that restriction in order to give these legal rights to circumvent their full practical effect.</p></blockquote><p>iFixit had a similar take on the decision.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We&#39;re glad the Register of Copyrights finally agreed that copyright law shouldn&#39;t keep you from fixing your stuff — regardless of what &#39;type&#39; of device it is. A legal solution for repairing optical drives on Xboxes and PlayStations is long overdue, and will help put desperately needed bricked consoles back in service. Unfortunately, the new rules still maintain some absurd limitations — like excluding commercial devices and noninfringing modification of software-enabled devices (like changing the settings on a software-enabled cat litter box). Particularly troubling is the Register&#39;s reliance on potential service contracts with manufacturers in order to deny the exemption for repair of commercial or industrial equipment. If repair is non-infringing (which it is) then manufacturers&#39; monopoly-preserving service contracts shouldn&#39;t prevent the Office from granting anbear on the issuance of the exemption. Moreover, the Copyright Office&#39;s process has some fatal flaws: exemption proponents have to return every three years to argue that their exemptions be renewed (a process that is both time and resource intensive), and it doesn&#39;t address whether people can make or distribute repair tools that circumvent manufacturer&#39;s digital locks. Without access to those tools, the exemptions are largely academic. This is why Congress needs to step in an permanently exempt repair, and repair tools, from Section 1201. Copyright Law should never stand in the way of repair. Until Congress finally fixes Section 1201 and grants a permanent right to repair, we’re going to be stuck on this ferris wheel with the Copyright Office every three years.</p></blockquote><p>The decision will complement the efforts of the Biden administration on the same front. At the start of July, the president <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html">ordered the Federal Trade Commission</a> to draft new rules to empower consumers and businesses to repair their devices on their own and at independent shops. The executive order marked the first time a US president had ever weighed in on the right to repair movement. Later that same month, the FTC complied with the directive, voting unanimously to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-right-to-repair-policy-statement-203721173.html">tackle unlawful repair restrictions</a>. At the time, it said it would work with law enforcement and policymakers to update existing regulations to protect small businesses and companies that would prevent them from fixing their own products.</p><p><strong>Update 2:03PM ET</strong>: Added comment from the Electronic Frontier Foundation. We&#39;ve also changed the headline to better reflect the nature of the Copyright Office&#39;s rulemaking.</p><p><strong>Update 2:51PM ET</strong>: Added comment from iFixit.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-copyright-office-section-1203-exemptions-172514601.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94a8f974-13dc-42bd-b8fb-08a3cd143078</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:25:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635361057</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T18:57:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f0e0c00-3747-11ec-bfd3-bdafb5f07762" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f0e0c00-3747-11ec-bfd3-bdafb5f07762" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[aldarinho via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toronto, Canada - May, 23,2020: Close up of disassemble game controller repairing, cleaning or diagnostic.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Close up of disassemble game controller repairing, cleaning or diagnostic.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's own TVs will support AirPlay 2 and HomeKit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-2021-update-omni-fire-tv-4-series-130041393.html">first in-house TVs</a> may be showcases for Alexa, but that isn&#39;t precluding the company from supporting someone else&#39;s ecosystem. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747811/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-apple-airplay-2-homekit">According</a> to <em>The Verge</em>, Amazon has unveiled plans to add support for Apple&#39;s AirPlay 2 and HomeKit to both higher-end Omni and budget 4-series Fire TV sets now that they&#39;re available. You can use AirPlay 2 to cast content from your iPhone, iPad or Mac, but the HomeKit integration may be the most notable — yes, you can use Siri to control an Amazon TV as part of your wider smart home network. Amazon would only say the support was coming &quot;soon.&quot;</p><p>The TVs themselves start <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire TV 4-series" href="https://amzn.to/3jJyUgd">at $370</a> for the 4-series, which provide the usual Fire TV integrations along with 4K and HDR support in sizes ranging from 43 inches to 55 inches. Omni sets, meanwhile, deliver Alexa-friendly far-field microphones and (on the two largest models) Dolby Vision HDR. They start <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6DZ81T/">at $410</a> and range from 43 inches to 75 inches.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The expansion isn&#39;t a complete shock. Insignia- and Toshiba-made Fire TV Edition sets <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toshiba-insignia-fire-tv-airplay-2-homekit-update-013526800.html">received AirPlay and HomeKit support</a> in July. We&#39;d add that Apple and Amazon are relatively cozy. Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-14-apple-music-works-on-echo-speakers.html">Echo speakers have streamed Apple Music</a> since 2018, for instance, while Prime Video integrates with the Apple TV app. Amazon has a strong incentive to include AirPlay and HomeKit, if just to fend off competition from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-tv-update-features-from-google-tv-160004195.html">Android TV</a> and sets that rely on Google Assistant.</p><p>As <em>The Verge</em> observed, though, there&#39;s no mention of either Apple platform coming to add-on media players like the Fire TV Stick 4K Max. For now, you&#39;ll have to buy hardware like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">Apple TV</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-os-10-airplay-2-homekit-support-hd-devices-130003400.html">modern Roku devices</a> to bring AirPlay and HomeKit to TVs where they aren&#39;t built-in.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-omni-4-series-airplay-2-homekit-support-171505953.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bde172a4-c133-4022-9648-c748645b344c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:15:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635353597</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T16:53:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f5a0d50-3740-11ec-be3e-c8f57be2f9d0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f5a0d50-3740-11ec-be3e-c8f57be2f9d0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Omni]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire TV Omni]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to use SharePlay on iOS 15]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iOS 15.1 was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-group-workout-shareplay-available-now-170031703.html">released yesterday</a>, which means you can finally start checking out Apple&#39;s long-awaited <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-wwdc-2021-facetime-messages-notification-summary-live-text-172526551.html">SharePlay feature</a>. After seeing how buggy it was on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">the iOS 15 beta</a>, I was able to check out SharePlay this week during a briefing with Apple, and the experience was surprisingly smooth. Though SharePlay works with just <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1583059388">a small collection of apps</a> at the moment, it&#39;s also coming soon to Disney+, while the NBA and TikTok apps will be updated today to support it. I watched a few videos and a Milwaukee Bucks game via these apps on my demo, and beyond being impressed by how much more stable everything is since the beta, I also found some tips particularly useful.</p><h2>Setup and starting a SharePlay session</h2><p>First, make sure you and your friends all update your devices to iOS 15.1 or iPadOS 15.1. Just like we observed in the beta, you need to start a FaceTime call before you can SharePlay anything. Once you&#39;re on a call, open a supported app and you&#39;ll see an alert at the top of the screen asking if you want to stream your content. When you start a session, your callers will see a box pop up at the top of the screen to join you.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For the most part, everyone you&#39;re SharePlaying with will need to have the relevant apps installed (i.e. TikTok, HBO Max, Showtime, Paramount, Apple TV etc). In some cases, they&#39;ll also need to have a subscription or at least an account.&nbsp;</p><p>While you watch a show together, anyone on the call can pause, skip forward or rewind, and that will bring everyone to the same point on the stream. As you watch something, FaceTime will run in picture-in-picture mode on top of your display, and whoever on your call is talking will appear in that box.&nbsp;</p><h2>Share your screen</h2><p>If you want to share your screen instead of watching a show, though, you&#39;ll need to tap on the screen while on your FaceTime call to pull up the commands panel and press the button on the right that resembles a person in front of a rectangle.&nbsp;</p><p>While you&#39;re sharing your screen, your friend can pinch to zoom on what you&#39;re showing them. But during a screen share session, your alerts (or other notices that pop up) won&#39;t appear on their screen, in case there&#39;s sensitive info you don&#39;t want others seeing. The pill on the top left of your screen will also turn purple to let remind you you&#39;re screen-sharing.&nbsp;</p><p>When I was watching someone share their screen, by the way, I could still go back to my own phone and open another app. FaceTime&#39;s picture-in-picture tile showed my caller&#39;s screen with their face in an embedded picture-in-picture. Inception!</p><h2>Other features</h2><p>The controls box also lets you access the iMessage window for everyone on the call. You can continue to watch a game on the NBA app with your family without your camera or mic on, and send texts instead. That&#39;s particularly helpful when you need a toilet break when a game runs long.</p><p>Apple also built a feature called smart volume to automatically lower the streaming audio when you&#39;re speaking so everyone can hear you. This works best with AirPods, but it&#39;ll also work with your device&#39;s speaker.</p><p>Depending on each app&#39;s developers, other tools can be embedded to make them more useful. In Apple Music, for example, you can look at the song&#39;s lyrics as they play in real time, and tapping on a specific lyric will bring you and your callers to that point in the track. When you&#39;re all on TikTok together, each person can like the videos they want, too. The popular game Heads Up will also be coming to SharePlay so you can guess the word on your face while your friends act it out for you.&nbsp;</p><p>SharePlay works with iPhones, iPads and Apple TVs, and most playback features are the same across Apple&#39;s ecosystem. Those with Apple Watches will also be able to use this feature for group workouts or meditations on Fitness+ with up to 32 callers. So far, SharePlay works with just a few apps, but as more developers integrate it, iOS users could find more ways to socialize and digitally gather with loved ones soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/shareplay-on-ios-15-hands-on-how-to-guide-170020600.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74c073cf-7de1-44c1-88d7-ad4eb826e218</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635353980</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T16:59:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/91f1f5e0-3744-11ec-bea7-46a0fa6a73ae" width="3900" height="2310" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/91f1f5e0-3744-11ec-bea7-46a0fa6a73ae" width="3900" height="2310" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A composite of three images showing how SharePlay on iOS 15 works.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SharePlay on iOS 15]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google is giving Android on tablets another shot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In case there wasn&#39;t enough news this week, Google is revealing a new version of Android that&#39;s designed for larger screens like tablets and foldables. It&#39;s called Android 12L, and is really just a set of new features for the existing OS that are optimized for big screens. The developer preview is available today as an SDK <a href="https://developer.android.com/">on Google&#39;s site</a> so app makers can begin taking in some of the new features that should make for a more cohesive experience on devices with bigger displays. The public version of 12L will arrive early next year, &quot;in time for the next wave of Android 12 tablets and foldables,&quot; the company said. The preview will also be &quot;coming soon to the Lenovo P12 Pro.&quot;</p><p>While Android already supports a sort of multi-window experience, there are still areas of the interface that feel more like a blown up version of a phone OS, rather than something that makes better use of the increased space. One of the things coming to Android 12L is a two-column layout for the notification shade and lockscreen when the system detects that the screen is above <a href="https://material.io/design/layout/pixel-density.html#pixel-density">600dps</a> wide. Google said other system surfaces and apps will adopt this look too, though it didn&#39;t specify which yet.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Android 12L will also feature a taskbar at the bottom of larger screens that will let you more easily open apps. This will also simplify the process of launching things in split-screen mode: just drag and drop an icon from the taskbar. Google is also enabling all apps to run in split screen, regardless of whether they are resizable.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b044ea20-373a-11ec-97ce-94d84a270f05" alt="An animation showing how to drag and drop icons from the new task bar on Android 12L to launch an app in split screen." data-uuid="502dde2b-0193-37bf-8e27-f4e35398c566"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Cosmetically, Google is also adding tools that let developers make their apps look better in various windows or views. They&#39;ll be able to use custom letterbox colors or treatments, apply custom rounded corners and adjust the position of inset windows.&nbsp;</p><p>The above features are already available for preview in the developer software, but there are also changes coming that app creators have to apply for users to experience them. Google recommends that developers create versions of their UI tailored to the window size class of each device, and it&#39;s added reference devices for programmers to see their layouts across phones, tablets, foldable&#39;s larger internal displays and desktops.&nbsp;</p><p>For devices that can fold, Android 12L will offer an API that will allow developers to make their apps aware of hinges or other boundaries, and use them &quot;as natural separators.&quot; This means that when supported, you might be able to use an app like Kindle and have it show a two-column layout when your device is folded and expand to fullscreen when you open your phone completely flat.</p><p>Google is also adding ways to make adopting this easier for developers with a new Activity embedding tool and other updates in the Jetpack Window Manager library. The interface will be backward-compatible, so those using older versions of Android can still use apps that are optimized for 12L.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/79125420-36a9-11ec-afff-89ccaa22737b" alt="An animation showing the Messages app expand into a two-column layout when its screen is extended." data-uuid="a0620ac0-d661-3648-b9ce-57e07d5e6d4d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The company is also releasing its Material You design system to Jetpack Compose, so that developers can add the adaptive theming capabilities to their apps. This means that, when supported, third-party apps can also take on the color scheme that Google derived from your wallpaper, and buttons or menu highlight hues can reflect the palette for a more cohesive look throughout Android 12.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, to give developers a reason (or disincentive) to get their apps optimized for Android 12L, Google is updating the Play Store. It will check each app against its <a href="https://developer.android.com/docs/quality-guidelines/large-screens-app-quality">large screen app quality guidelines</a> and take the results into ranking and search listing considerations. It&#39;ll go even further by warning people on bigger devices with notices on an app&#39;s Play Store page if it&#39;s not been optimized for 12L.&nbsp;</p><p>Android has long faced criticism over being a poor OS for tablets and bigger displays, and 12L does appear promising. Google also announced some updates to make it easier for developers to code for WearOS, including offering Jetpack Compose support for the platform. It looks like the company is working hard to improve areas that it&#39;s been behind Apple on, and we&#39;ll have to see how developers take to these changes to know if Google&#39;s tablet, foldable and smartwatch dreams might succeed.</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-l-tablets-foldables-170002343.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c9443d30-d371-468b-b5a8-a37777773a6c</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 17:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635354372</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T17:06:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5a3bbc80-36a9-11ec-befe-f81a460fcf06" width="1600" height="848" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5a3bbc80-36a9-11ec-befe-f81a460fcf06" width="1600" height="848" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Examples of Google's Android 12L on four different devices: A phone, foldable, tablet and vertical tablet.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12L]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
