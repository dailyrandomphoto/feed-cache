As first reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776563/spacex-starlink-rectangular-dish-router-mounting-internet-satellites"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the company now offers a <a href="https://api.starlink.com/public-files/Accessories_Guide_Rectangular.pdf">rectangular option</a> (PDF) that&#39;s smaller and lighter than its original circular one. Users have to install that antenna on their rooftop or anywhere high up with a clear view of the sky to be able to access its satellite internet.&nbsp;</p><p>The original version is a standard dish that&#39;s 23-inch wide, but the rectangular version is only 12 inches wide and 19 inches long. It&#39;s also only 9.2 pounds, which is almost half the weight of its circular counterpart. The new terminal&#39;s smaller form factor could give users more options when it comes to potential locations where they can install it. In addition, the rectangular terminal comes with more accessory options, including a long pole users can simply stick in the ground so they no longer have to mount the antenna on their rooftop.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>SpaceX <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-internet-service-99-a-month-045831110.html">launched</a> Starlink as a beta service in late 2020 and offered customers access to its satellite internet for $99 a month. Users would have to pay $499 on top of that for its hardware kit, though, which includes the antenna, its stand, power supply and a WiFi router. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell <a href="https://sea.pcmag.com/networking/45600/spacex-prepares-to-cut-starlink-dish-cost-by-half-later-this-year">said</a> in August that the original dish cost $3,000 to produce, and while the company was able to get that down to $1,300, it was still selling the kit at a loss.&nbsp;</p><p>Shotwell also said at the time that the terminal it&#39;s releasing this year &quot;will cost roughly half&quot; of what its current user terminals cost and that the company may be able to cut that in half again. <em>The Verge notes</em>, however, that the hardware kit is still being sold for $499 even with the rectangular antenna, and SpaceX has yet to reveal whether it will be sold at a lower price in the future. Potential new customers who don&#39;t mind paying the same price for it can get the rectangular terminal when they order a kit, so long as they&#39;re in the US.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/starlink-rectangular-terminal-satellite-internet-112330512.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2c219776-a1ef-480d-a132-1e5fb8651523</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 11:23:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636716242</ingested><modified>2021-11-12T11:24:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/faedf590-43a0-11ec-bf5e-027e37078eee" width="1600" height="969" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/faedf590-43a0-11ec-bf5e-027e37078eee" width="1600" height="969" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Starlink]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Starlink]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Starlink]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sky Glass is a gilded cage you pay to be locked inside]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since the 1970s, the story of the television is one of conquest as it swallowed more and more space in our living rooms. Owning a set wasn’t good enough, we needed a VCR, BetaMax or LaserDisc player to lurk on a nearby shelf. A decade later, a console or home computer would take its place in the orbit of the TV, followed not long after by the cable box. And, in the DVD age, people would take advantage of the affordability of rudimentary 5.1 surround sound to add in an AV Receiver, or Amp, to that ever-growing TV cabinet. And, as TVs got flatter and wider, their integral speakers stopped being up to the job so much that a dedicated sound bar was essential. Throw in a streaming stick or puck, and our TVs have become ecosystems of their own, no longer lurking but dominating our living rooms.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sky-smart-tv-glass-comcast-095543008.html">Sky Glass</a>, then, is a reaction against this sprawl, an all-in-one TV, set-top-box and soundbar that promises to eliminate the clutter. Hell, Sky Glass even has its own games pre-installed, although you’ll still need to bring your console along for the serious stuff. It’s also the first true-blue Sky device that doesn’t need a satellite dish for connection, instead delivering all of its content through the internet. That’s a long time coming, too, since Sky has been teasing and promising the launch of a Sky-branded internet-only TV platform <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-26-sky-q-no-satellite-dish-2018.html">for years now</a> (distinct from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-14-now-tv-smart-box-review.html">Now</a>, at least).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In many ways, Sky Glass is the logical end point for the smart TV industry, a set that bakes in everything you need, and keeps you there. It’s also the final step on a long road for content producers as they regain control over what you can watch, and when.</p><p><strong>Hardware</strong></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5d78d570-4236-11ec-b9db-f9889ed68aab" alt="Image of Sky Glass in green on a white table" data-uuid="23c93e09-a668-3042-b00d-4960dd36f008"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sky</div></figure><p>Sky loaned me the 55-inch Glass model in black for two weeks with access to a press account which included Sky Ultimate. It ships in a cardboard box, free from single use plastic as part of the company’s commitment to building a greener device. It ships with a stand that can pull double-duty as a wall mount should you require, which is fiddlier to build than I would have liked. The instructions, printed on the box, are ambiguous enough that I made at least one mistake that led to me disassembling the whole thing and starting again. For the sake of your backs, get help to lift the thing, because it was a feat worthy of a medal just to hoik this thing up and onto my TV table alone.</p><p>Most flat-screen TVs try to minimise their bulk, tapering out beyond the area where the power, mainboard and connectivity is sited. That’s not the situation with Sky Glass which is designed as a solid cuboid, lest the cut-out for mounting the stand. This thing looks and feels like an iMac G5 if Jonathan Ive suddenly discovered a penchant for making everything feel solid and immovable. In part, this is because this unit is bigger than the 43-inch TV I own, but it’s more down to the solidity in its design and the built-in soundbar which means that, by default, the hardware suffocates the space that it’s in. Not to brag, but my living room is much bigger than the UK’s average and I’ve caught myself thinking “woof, that is a big TV” several times already.</p><p>Getting the thing to work, meanwhile, takes about as long as typing your WiFi password. Once a very quick update is applied, you can be kicking back and watching the box in five minutes.</p><p>The system inside Glass is driven by a quad-core AmLogic ARM A55 system-on-chip which only occasionally slows down or stutters. Some of this, I’m sure, is down to being tied to your internet connection for all of your viewing than it is the hardware’s limitations. When watching live football in UHD, I got the odd stutter and black screen, which is something Sky says is a teething issue with the new platform. But don’t be surprised if, when watching on-demand content, rewinding and fast-forwarding video brings a little stutter or two of its very own.</p><p>Despite the fact that Sky Glass is designed not to have too many additional components hitched to it, it does pack a trio of HDMI 2.1 ports with support for CEC. One of the ports supports eARC for audio passthrough, but given the system has a soundbar built in it’s unlikely most will need this. In addition, the unit supports Bluetooth 5.0, has a 10/100 Mbps Ethernet port and WiFi 6. A USB-C port lurking round back is for charging only, but will deliver up to 15W should you need to connect a smart device to juice.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/201f8800-4235-11ec-be6b-77cc42dbaa0e" alt="Rendered image of Sky Glass&#39; Stream Puck and the corresponding Glass Remote" data-uuid="5df024bc-851c-325d-8711-a1af132e6195"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sky</div></figure><p>It’s worth noting that Sky offers a “Whole Home” package to accompany Sky Glass, letting you watch TV in other rooms. For that, you will need to pick up a Sky Stream Puck, which costs £50 per unit (plus an additional £10 per-month to enable the feature). Sky didn’t send me a Stream Puck so I can’t say how well it works.</p><p>Sky Glass requires a minimum home broadband speed of 15Mbps, a generous (or nonexistent) data cap and a further 5Mbps per Sky Stream Puck you install, up to a maximum of six. Sadly, despite running a maxed out internet service, my viewing was interrupted on one more than one occasion. I had several stutters when watching one football game, and all attempts to watch the Manchester Derby live in 4K were met with a black screen and a message to “Please wait for your programme to load.” When it does work, live sports run about half a minute behind the feed on a standard satellite connection.</p><p><strong>Sound and Vision</strong></p><p>Every Sky Glass model houses a TP-Vision made, 4K UHD (3,840 x 2,160) Quantum Dot display with a 60Hz refresh rate. It is available in 43- 55-, and 65-inch sizes, and supports HDR 10, Dolby Vision, Hybrid Log Gamma (HLG) and 10-bit color. The first set Sky sent me had some backlight issues, but since its replacement arrived, I’ve had no complaints about the picture quality here, especially when watching gorgeous movies in broad daylight or dark environments. It seems, to me, that you’re getting the best experience you can from a screen like this without making the leap up to an OLED display, which wouldn’t be affordable at this sort of price anyway. The 60Hz panel may give some pause to gamers, as the latest consoles from Sony and Microsoft support 120Hz. There’s also no dedicated ‘game mode’ to reduce latency as you’d find on most regular TVs.</p><p>Sky Glass comes with a sextet of speakers buried inside its chassis offering support for 2.1 Stereo, as well as Dolby Atmos and Dolby Digital. There are three forward-firing speakers, two upward-firers as well as a single subwoofer. The company says that the total output of all six is around 215 Watts and promises support for enhanced speech modes. Honestly, in those rare moments when you feel you can indulge your passion for cinema and turn the volume up high, the sound coming out of this thing is plenty good enough for a living room. Sadly, much of the glitz with systems like this is only audible at the sort of volumes that’ll get you knifed by your nearest neighbor. But, overall, the integral soundbar is more than enough to make me wish all TVs had half-decent audio again.</p><p><strong>User Interface</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-29-sky-q-review.html">When Sky launched Q in 2016</a>, it was with the explicit aim of putting a crowbar between you and live television. No longer would you aimlessly scroll through the company’s near-infinite EPG looking for something to watch. After it had time enough to understand the sort of thing you liked, it would be able to serve that up on the home screen whenever you turned your TV on. Now, while Sky Q can already interface and search through third-party apps like Netflix, there was still a church-and-state-like divide between Sky’s content and those from third-parties. With Sky Glass, that line has been dissolved, and the new software can index content from almost all of its partners.</p><p>Essentially, this is Sky’s way of masking the balkanization that takes place very frequently with the same show on multiple broadcasters and streaming platforms. Because I have small kids, the best examples I can think of are from children’s TV, but this applies to plenty of others as well. For instance, Sky’s own on-demand platform has a selection of episodes of <em>Blue’s Clues and You</em> available from the show’s three seasons. But since the first season is also available complete on Netflix, Sky Glass fills in the gaps with the Netflix-hosted episodes where it can. Similarly, <em>Bluey</em> is broadcast by the BBC in the UK but only offers a handful of episodes from the show’s first season on demand. Disney+ (which I do not yet subscribe to) has both seasons in their entirety, and I can see what I <em>can</em> and <em>can’t</em> access within a single menu.</p><p>At launch, Sky will index content from BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub, All 4, Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime Video. Shortly after the hardware was announced, Sky’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-22-comcast-to-acquire-sky.html">parent company Comcast</a> announced that it had signed a deal to bring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-app-comcast-xfinity-sky-150136639.html">Apple’s TV app to its platforms</a> in the US and UK. As well as those content providers, Sky Glass can access YouTube, play music from Spotify, stream live exercise classes from Peloton and mobile games from the Play.Works stable. Unlike a smart TV or external streaming puck, however, you cannot add in additional apps unless Sky chooses to enable them. (Although, to be fair, it’s not as if companies like Amazon and Roku can guarantee that either, given <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-05-google-blocking-youtube-on-amazon-echo-show-fire-tv.html">their</a> prior <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-google-youtube-tv-app-preferential-treatment-140612500.html">skirmishes</a> with YouTube.)</p><p>The UI itself is very much an evolution of the template Sky laid down in 2016, with the linear, live TV menu not the first thing you have access to. Instead, you open with the curated “Top Picks For You” section which pulls from all of the services that you have access to. Because this is a loaned TV with a press account, these recommendations were all fairly generic and tied to Sky’s big-name shows but I’m sure they would improve over time. The menu now takes up a lot more verticality than before, mirroring a trend you see more and more online, where every website you visit requires at least one scroll before you get to the items of interest.</p><p>Scroll down and you’ll get a run of lozenge-buttons that break out various categories of content — TV Shows, Movies, Sport, Kids and the like. (Aside, YouTube really did remove the need for linear music television didn’t it? I haven’t looked at a satellite TV music channel for years but the “Music” button reveals only a handful of remaining channels.) Then you’ll get the linear TV menu, or at least what’s on BBC One and Two — you’ll need to click in to get access to the full TV guide. This has been given a graphical spit-and-polish to take advantage of the screen but is mostly the same as before. There’s a greater emphasis on artwork and good visuals, but Sky has mercifully opted not to fix what wasn’t broken.</p><p>Beyond the main TV guide, you get your “Playlist,” which is what Sky has created to replace the idea of a recording. After that, you’ll get a Top 10 list of shows pulled from every Sky user across every one of Sky’s platforms, a banner showing off Sky’s own original and exclusive programming, and a list of Play.Works games. These games are little more than mobile crapware titles — complete with pre-roll ads — that you’ll try once, realize are a waste of your time, and never play again. If there’s one irritation, it’s that the main settings menu is buried at the very bottom of this page, and takes several long presses to reach if you’re in a hurry.</p><p><strong>Remote</strong></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7cd8d340-4234-11ec-bddb-a2668bff909c" alt="A trio of Sky Remotes (Sorry I couldn&#39;t find the original Q remote in my cupboard to round out the lineup)" data-uuid="0b8c8d14-0528-3786-ad2d-58b3026d21ec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>I’d say most people have an intimate relationship with their remote controls, so often we use them throughout the day. The map of their buttons is laid indelibly onto our subconscious to the point where I think I could probably navigate mine blindfolded. Sky’s remotes are historically best in class for both ergonomics and <em>thumbfeel</em>, but the Glass remote (pictured, right) is a culture shock. Now, I’m averse to saying that just because something is different it is inherently bad, but the process to unlearn half a decades’ worth of training has been a challenge.</p><p>Part of this is because Sky has pulled several well-used buttons off the remote to simplify how it works. Some of those functions are now available in an on-screen menu triggered by the remote control equivalent of a hamburger button. Others, Sky would argue, have been replaced by the unit’s automatic curation and voice control features. But it means that things that were previously directly accessible in two seconds now take significantly longer. It is this drive for efficiency that, in some cases, makes things less efficient overall.</p><p>Since the days of the Sky+ remote, there has always been a Volume rocker on the left hip of the device and a Channel Up/Down rocker on the right. But, this time around, Sky has ditched the channel Up/Down rocker, and moved the volume rocker over to the opposite side. Similarly, the dedicated transport controls which used to circle the clickpad have also been snipped. Both of those jobs are now the exclusive domain of the clickpad — another chunk of unlearning you’ll need to do if you’re coming from another Sky product.</p><p>One consequence of these removals is that there’s now no easy way to Page Up/Down through the EPG like you could with the Channel Up/Down rocker. And you can’t push forward 24 hours using the Fast Forward button like you used to. Now, one of my weekly rituals is to look for which episodes of <em>Columbo</em> — a show I fell in love with during the pandemic — are being broadcast each Sunday. But whereas I could page down and across to find Sunday’s schedule in about 10 seconds with Sky Q, now you have to long press on the click pad. And it takes forever.</p><p>Now, my irritations with the button layout notwithstanding, the Glass remote is a very savvy upgrade. The hardware is now coated in a matte rubber that will hopefully not scratch as easily as the previous gloss models did. The overall layout is cleaner, I will admit, and the removal of the text buttons from the number pad — while annoying — makes everything look nicer. Not to mention that the buttons now light up when in use, which helps you in low-light situations and, you know, generally looks pretty cool.</p><p><strong>Voice</strong></p><p>Sky has been offering voice search for years, but now you can simply bark “Hello Sky” at your TV for it to turn on. Hell, the thing has a motion sensor, and will spring into life if it detects movement in front of it after a long period of stillness (except at night). It’s clear that Sky wants you to use Glass more like a piece of smart home gear than as an old-fashioned TV. And it works most of the time, although my feeling is that it takes two good tries before it understands exactly what you’re saying. When you speak (while there’s something already playing) it’ll often mute the speakers and ask you to go again in order to get a better shot of hearing what’s going on.</p><p>Honestly, the ability to just say “Hello Sky” as you walk into a room to turn the TV on (if it hasn’t yet detected your movement) is pretty cool. But we are not, <em>not entirely</em>, at the point where you can rely upon this search functionality as a complete replacement for old-fashioned text search. It doesn’t help that you have to revert back to the remote after your initial query to do anything you actually want to do. So, at this point, it straddles that awkward gulf between a novelty you use only to show off to your neighbours and an everyday essential.</p><p><strong>Playlist</strong></p><div id="c6a48bcbc730447da224e97461c52d91"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SUwved9OFlw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>There has always been an awkward relationship between those who make and sell movies and TV shows, and those who consume it. The former wants absolute control over how material is distributed and the total profit maximization that ensues. End users, meanwhile, may feel that if they’ve already paid to watch something, they don’t want to be nickeled and dimed into paying again. But between DVDs, and now streaming, the balance of power has been handed in its entirety back to the producers. Sky Glass, if it was possible, goes a step further, stripping you of all of your rights to engage with broadcast material on your own terms.</p><p>Doomy thesis statements aside, Sky Glass does not have the ability to locally record broadcast content. In fact, it doesn’t even use the word “record” in the 17-page document sent to reviewers, because it’s no longer a thing. Instead, you have access to your own “Playlist” to which you can add content that you’d like to watch. For on-demand content that is already neatly packaged on a server, either in Sky’s HQ, or Netflix’s, Or Amazon’s, Or the BBC’s, that’s fine. It’s when it comes time to save something that isn’t easily made available on-demand that the real issues start to become apparent. Sky added that there isn’t a storage limit per-se, since all of it is stored on a server somewhere anyway.</p><p>Put simply, Sky has a series of digital recorders chopping up and saving programs from live TV as they are broadcast. But, for various obvious legal and contractual reasons, it can’t simply let you access those recordings willy-nilly no matter how much you pay Sky per month. Sadly, the only way you’re going to be able to access any of that material is if you had the foresight to add that particular broadcast to your Playlist ahead of time. But, alas, even if that is the case, you’re not actually going to get the right to watch and “keep” that recording in “perpetuity” like you can with Sky Q.</p><p><em>Match of the Day</em>, as a good example, broadcasts edited highlights of the weekend’s Premier League games on Saturday and Sunday nights. On Sky Q, or any other recording system, I can record the show and watch it at my leisure a day, or a month after the first broadcast. Sky Glass, however, doesn’t let you record the show, but instead directs you to the version available to catch up through BBC iPlayer. Now, because of the Premier League’s close control of its rights, that instalment is pulled a week after first broadcast.</p><p>In fact, even things that are recorded via Sky’s cloud recording system are only available for you for twelve months before they are removed.</p><p>An even better example comes with reruns of <em>Frasier</em>, which air at 9am on weekday mornings. Even if I set the series to my playlist in good time, none of the episodes are available to watch after the fact because the on-demand rights are blocked. Because the recording is taking place in a server room at a Sky facility somewhere in the UK, it’s no longer under your control. And this is the problem with ceding any and all control back to the content providers, because it comes at the expense of any form of convenience. (Paramount+, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-europe-launch-145633779.html">coming to the UK at some point in 2022</a>, and will be available on Sky Glass.) I’d like to remind you at this point that if you max out your Sky subscription, you’ll pay more than a hundred pounds a month for this lack of service.</p><p>Reading the <a href="https://helpforum.sky.com/t5/Sky-Glass/Playlist-FAQ-Q-amp-A/td-p/3814207/page/2">user forums</a> on Sky’s website has been instructive here, and some of the earliest Sky Glass adopters aren’t thrilled at the fudge. Certainly, there’s nothing in the TV Guide to let you know that a playlisted show isn’t available to watch afterward. Hell, add <em>Frasier</em> to your own playlist and after broadcast it’ll just show a blank tile, click on that and you’ll be shown a list of episodes broadcasting live that week. And there’s no way ahead of time to know if this is the situation that will greet you when you get home from a long day at work.</p><p>One thing that I hope Sky Glass will do is force every broadcaster and streaming platform to audit their metadata. There is nothing worse than looking for a show on-demand, selecting it, and then learning that actually the content included does not match the description. After all, if we’re going to be searching for these things on-demand a lot more frequently, it’s not going to be good enough to simply dump your content online and hope the descriptions are right.</p><p><strong>Economics</strong></p><p>Sky Glass is available in five colors: Ocean Blue, Dusky Pink, Racing Green, Ceramic White and Anthracite Black. As a standalone purchase, Sky Glass costs £649, £849 and £1,049 for the 43-, 55- and 65-inch models, respectively. But Sky is betting that users would much prefer to fold in that cost to their monthly TV subscription, paying a token figure up-front and spreading the cost over 24, or 48 months interest-free. Users then need to work out which package they want to add to it, with the cheapest being the Sky Ultimate TV bundle (which includes a basic Netflix sub) for £26 a month. It’s £5 extra per month for HDR and Dolby Atmos content, £25 for Sky Sports, £11 for Sky Cinema, and £5 for Sky Kids. (Users can also pay for BT Sport, for an additional £30 per month, with all of these Sky TV packages running on a 31-day rolling contract.) In addition, it appears that after the first year, users will also need to pony up an additional £5 per-month to be able to <a href="https://helpforum.sky.com/t5/Sky-Glass/Playlist-FAQ-Q-amp-A/td-p/3814207">skip ads</a> from inside the ITV Hub, STV Player and All4 apps.</p><p>Here’s an easier breakdown of the prices and what you can expect to shell out, both for your TV and for the content to fuel it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9a7f0bc0-4235-11ec-b6ff-f15cca0a6c9d" alt="Image of Sky&#39;s Plans" data-uuid="f0e43260-6940-3083-b60f-c9ae08c25900"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sky</div></figure><p>The one problem is that it’s tricky to quantify what sort of rival TVs we should compare this to, if any. After all, most regular TVs require dedicated soundbars and a set-top-box so it would be unfair to run this side-by-side with a standard set of panels at these dimensions. But I can set myself a budget there, or thereabouts, and see what sort of goodies I can turn up.</p><p>Panel-wise, Hisense’s A7-series is a good place to start, since you can get a 43-, 55- and 65-inch panel depending on your need. Each one is a Quantum Dot 4K set including HDR 10+, Dolby Vision, a 60Hz refresh rate and voice control through Google Assistant or Alexa. Depending on the panel size you go for, this will set you back <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9452965">£399</a>, <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9452989?clickSR=slp:term:hisense%20a7%2055:2:11:1">£499</a> or <a href="https://www.argos.co.uk/product/9452927?clickSR=slp:term:hisense%20a7%2065:2:5:1">£699</a>, which gives you headroom enough to find a half-decent soundbar. Sadly, the cheapest Dolby Atmos-equipped soundbar I could find was JBL’s Bar 5.0, which sets you back <a href="https://www.currys.co.uk/gbuk/tv-and-home-entertainment/dvd-blu-ray-and-home-cinema/home-cinema-systems-and-sound-bars/jbl-bar-5-0-compact-sound-bar-with-dolby-atmos-black-10221777-pdt.html">£249</a>. Thankfully, Sky Q’s cheap, so there is a chance you could avoid being locked into this new content dystopia for some time yet.</p><p>Now, if you so choose to buy Sky Glass and then not continue with your Sky subscription (once Glass is paid for, or bought outright), then it’ll still work. The company says that the three HDMI ports and built-in soundbar will all work fine, and the app will still enable you to access third-party apps. The only friction you’ll apparently notice is that you’ll need to re-sign in to all of the apps that you’re using on the system. You can also watch Digital Terrestrial TV by plugging in the requisite aerial and setting it up as required.</p><p><strong>Should you buy it?</strong></p><p>The one downside of making any sort of pronouncement about a Sky product is that Sky Glass’ proliferation is almost inevitable. After all, history shows that Sky is happy to gently reduce the price of its hardware products to help get its services into more homes. I have no doubt that while, for now, Sky Glass is a pricey option, in a year or two it’ll be discounted enough that it’s impossible to ignore.</p><p>And I wouldn’t blame you if you wanted one purely because it offers a level of simplicity and elegance that you simply don’t get with most regular TVs. Banishing the bulk of the sprawl and ensuring that your TV corner stops looking like a server room is something to aspire toward. Certainly, Sky Glass — on paper — is a fantastic idea, and the execution is pretty good in almost every regard.</p><p>It’s just that buying Sky Glass ensures you are forever yoked to the devil’s bargain of being reminded, constantly, that you have no control. The sharp elbows of the content licensing giants means that things you wanted to record at your convenience can now not be relied upon. If a media giant in California doesn’t think you deserve to watch a daytime TV show when you get in from work, then you don’t get that opportunity.</p><p>There’s a very reasonable solution to this problem, of course, which is that Sky should throw in a HDD into this hardware. I don’t believe for a moment that there isn’t the space, and there should be no technical limitations as to why you can’t with this system on chip. For the majority of shows, you can watch them on-demand without any fuss, and for everything else, you can have a local recording free from the clutches of content licensing restrictions.</p><p>If you’ve rolled your eyes at the back half of this review, and honestly see no need to worry and fuss about access to recordings, then Sky Glass is for you. But if you’re even a little bit concerned about the lack of freedom that such a system brings, I’d say hold fire for now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sky-glass-tv-review-103031952.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03b36a47-3395-4496-a3db-c0d1571c6ace</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 10:30:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636709691</ingested><modified>2021-11-12T09:35:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/72b088a0-4233-11ec-8f7b-203cccbad02a" width="1800" height="1219" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/72b088a0-4233-11ec-8f7b-203cccbad02a" width="1800" height="1219" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of Sky Glass sat on my TV stand (which is an IKEA Hack)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sky Glass]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Biden signs law blocking Huawei and ZTE from receiving FCC licenses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>US President Joe Biden has signed into law the Secure Equipment Act that blocks companies like Huawei and ZTE from receiving network licenses. The new rules mean the FCC (Federal Communications Commission) can no longer consider any applications for network equipment that may pose a national security threat, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/biden-signs-legislation-tighten-us-restrictions-huawei-zte-2021-11-11/"><em>Reuters</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>With the measure, the FCC can no longer issue or review licenses to companies on the FCC&#39;s &quot;Covered Equipment or Services List.&quot; It was passed by a 420-4 House vote and approved unanimously by the US Senate <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-lawmakers-vote-tighten-restrictions-huawei-zte-2021-10-28/">last month</a>. &quot;We have already determined that this gear poses an unacceptable risk to our national security, so closing what I have called the ‘Huawei loophole’ is an appropriate action for us to take,&quot; said FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>We have already determined that this gear poses an unacceptable risk to our national security, so closing what I have called the ‘Huawei loophole’ is an appropriate action for us to take.</p></blockquote><p>The FCC formally designated ZTE and Huawei as national security threats last year, finding that the companies had close ties to Chinese Communist Party. However, they were still able to apply for licenses as long as no federal funds were involved. To that end, Carr has been pushing legislators to pass the Secure Equipment Act.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Once we have determined that Huawei or other gear poses an unacceptable national security risk, it makes no sense to allow that exact same equipment to be purchased and inserted into our communications networks as long as federal dollars are not involved. The presence of these insecure devices in our networks is the threat, not the source of funding used to purchase them,&quot; Carr said back in March.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, the FCC launched a $1.9 billion &quot;rip and replace&quot; program to help US telecoms replace Huawei and ZTE equipment they may be using. House member Steve Scalise last last week that &quot;Huawei and ZTE &quot;are probably the two most prominent companies that still have a lot of equipment out there where Americans’ data runs across those networks.&quot;</p><p>Huawei has yet to comment on the legislation, but last summer called the FCC&#39;s proposed revision &quot;misguided and unnecessarily punitive.&quot; Joe Biden is expected to speak with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in in a &quot;virtual summit&quot; tentatively set for next Monday.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/biden-signs-law-blocking-huawei-and-zte-from-fcc-licenses-081513515.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed182262-79bf-4f9e-aef8-c8f58df734c7</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 08:15:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636702292</ingested><modified>2021-11-12T07:31:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3407f1d0-4385-11ec-9ff7-9d0f30515bc1" width="4934" height="3421" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3407f1d0-4385-11ec-9ff7-9d0f30515bc1" width="4934" height="3421" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barcroft Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SHANGHAI, CHINA - OCTOBER 12, 2021 - Huawei's flagship store is seen in Shanghai, China, On Oct. 12, 2021.

Now, it has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CWHL67OPk_H/">introduced</a> two features already widely popular on TikTok, perhaps in hopes that they can convert those who&#39;ve been hesitating to use Reels due to their absence.

They then have to choose between the two available voice options before posting their video. While text-to-speech will make Reels more accessible, it&#39;s also popular on TikTok just because some find a robotic voice narrating their activities a funny addition to their content.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/13ff2650-4386-11ec-bd67-100dfc4d383e" style="height:780;width:640;" alt="Instagram" data-uuid="48b33c86-5992-366b-955b-bac3bb4edaa3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Instagram</div></figure><p>In addition to Text-to-Speech, Instagram has also rolled out Voice Effects for Reels. With this feature, creators can change their voice as they see fit, and choose from the several options available. They can change their voice to sound like they inhaled some helium or to sound like a giant. They can also choose to sound like an announcer, a robot or a vocalist. Instagram has rolled out both audio tools, so users can now give them a try.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-text-to-speech-voice-effects-reels-071547265.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b71bb65e-98ea-456a-9986-b9d2542b72a1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 12 Nov 2021 07:15:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636701379</ingested><modified>2021-11-12T07:16:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8bb73cb0-8cab-11eb-97ff-90c6c5088a4e" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8bb73cb0-8cab-11eb-97ff-90c6c5088a4e" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wachiwit via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bangkok, Thailand - February 15, 2021 : iPhone 7 showing its screen with popular social networking applications which are Clubhouse, Instagram and Facebook.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Clubhouse and popular social networking applications]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch now allows recurring subscriptions on iOS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since 2019, Twitch has offered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-18-twitch-ios-subscriptions.html"><ins>Sub Tokens</ins></a> as a way for iOS users to support their favorite streamers. They offer the same benefits of subscribing on desktop, including access to ad-free viewing and sub-only chat, but they’re a one-time purchase you can redeem when you want. However, Twitch is now doing away with that mechanism in favor of a more straightforward approach.</p><p>Once you update to the latest version of the Twitch iOS app, you’ll find the option to purchase recurring subscriptions. It’s a change the company says it’s making based on user feedback. “We learned from the community that non-renewing Sub Tokens on iOS can prevent them from consistently enjoying subscriber benefits and supporting their favorite creators,” the company said in a <a href="https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2021/11/11/available-now-monthly-recurring-subs-on-ios/?utm_referrer=https://t.co/"><ins>blog post</ins></a>. With the tweak, you don’t have to worry about losing access to your subscriber benefits or missing a sub streak.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sub Tokens aren’t disappearing, at least not immediately. Twitch will continue to sell them until December 1st. At that point, you can continue to redeem until January 10th, 2022. After that date, any remaining Sub Tokens you have left on your account will be refunded by Apple. All told, it’s a chance that should make it easier for Twitch users to support their favorite streamers, particularly if they primarily use an iOS device to watch them.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-reccuring-subscriptions-ios-215938996.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f1e47e9a-f3a2-4cd1-8420-eea8c9a37d83</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 21:59:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636667981</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T21:59:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/0f612e20-072a-11eb-8ebf-8c1f3d1cc752" width="4039" height="2693" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/0f612e20-072a-11eb-8ebf-8c1f3d1cc752" width="4039" height="2693" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thomas Trutschel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - OCTOBER 11: In this photo illustration the logo of live streaming video platform Twitch is displayed on a smartphone on October 11, 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

Starting today, you can order household items, including snacks and cleaning supplies, from more than 9,000 Dollar General locations across the US. DoorDash claims it will deliver most orders in under an hour. Additionally, it won’t employ time slots and there’s no minimum you need to spend to get something delivered to you.</p><p>Compared to a CVS or Walgreens, Dollar General is more of an unusual partner for DoorDash. The chain has built its reputation on affordable prices. Adding a delivery fee to a purchase from one of its stores feels counterintuitive. It has also built stores in places that don’t have nearby access to supermarkets and Walmarts. In that way, it’s hard to see the delivery option appealing to either frequent Dollar General or DoorDash customers, but at least it’s an option for those who want it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/doordash-dollar-general-partnership-201907762.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee44ac9a-2455-4055-be3c-93a63272f57b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 20:19:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636661951</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T20:19:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a153c840-432b-11ec-bd7d-2a88dc88a7a0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a153c840-432b-11ec-bd7d-2a88dc88a7a0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DoorDash / Dollar General]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dollar General]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dollar General]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[David Fincher's Netflix documentary series 'VOIR' debuts on December 6th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>VOIR</em>, the latest Netflix series from <em>Zodiac</em> and <em>Fight Club</em> director David Fincher, will debut on December 6th.

The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en_US/games/detail/twitch-switch/">free app</a> offers the same core functionality as Twitch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-26-twitch-ps4-app-overhaul.html">on other consoles</a>, including on-demand videos. However, the Switch&#39;s nature might give it an edge — you can watch docked if you want the largest screen possible, or handheld if you have the itch to tune in from bed.</p><p>There is a potential hitch in the Switch version, though.

While Nintendo hasn&#39;t been adamantly opposed to Twitch, former president Reggie Fils-Aime told <em>Polygon</em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/6/12/5802560/nintendos-fils-aime-wii-u-wont-get-twitch-gameplay-streaming-because">in 2014</a> that the company preferred more focused video sharing instead of simply streaming whatever you happened to be playing. The video game pioneer also has a long history of trying to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-27-nintendo-planning-youtube-revenue-splitting-affiliate-program.html">control online videos</a> and share profits from video producers&#39; work. Although Nintendo has softened its stance since then, it&#39;s not exactly in a rush to make Twitch a two-way affair.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitch-app-nintendo-switch-190506686.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3fc6a3c9-830b-4fcd-97ad-62109403bc92</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 19:05:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636657277</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T19:01:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/79c176b0-431c-11ec-9b0f-7d52b3a9f14a" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/79c176b0-431c-11ec-9b0f-7d52b3a9f14a" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitch]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitch app for Nintendo Switch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitch app for Nintendo Switch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Panic's Playdate handheld is delayed until 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-delayed-february-2022-195957878.html"><ins>Steam Deck</ins></a> isn’t the only handheld that won’t ship in 2021.

GM Defense president Steve duMont <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/gm-plans-to-produce-military-vehicle-based-on-hummer-ev-in-2022.html">told <em>CNBC</em></a> the company planned to build a military vehicle prototype based on the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmcs-newly-unveiled-hummer-ev-suv-is-830-hp-of-electric-supertruck-220323684.html">Hummer EV</a>. The eLRV, or electric Light Reconnaissance Vehicle, would modify the Hummer&#39;s frame, motors and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-reveals-the-ultium-motors-that-are-key-to-its-all-electric-shift-120029040.html">Ultium batteries</a> to suit US military requirements.</p><p>The prototype should be ready sometime in 2022. There&#39;s no guarantee American armed forces will use the eLRV, however. The Army is still exploring the viability of EVs like this, and GM will have to meet formal requirements (along with a rival manufacturer) if and when they exist. A choice is due sometime in the mid-2020s.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Any military EV faces logistical challenges, at least for machines on the front lines. Soldiers couldn&#39;t just find a charging station on the battlefield, for starters — they&#39;d need transportable charging systems that aren&#39;t dependent on a working electrical grid. DuMont said GM could provide combustion-powered charging systems. We&#39;d add that temperatures significantly affect EV range, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gogoro-launches-its-battery-swapping-tech-in-china-080359215.html">swappable batteries</a> (important for quick turnarounds and repairs) are still in their relative infancy.</p><p>There could be advantages to military EV adoption. They might improve overall emissions, even if the need for combustion-based chargers partly offset that advantage. EVs generally require less maintenance due to fewer moving parts. And their quiet operation could be extremely useful for recon and stealth missions where conventional rides would be too noisy. The challenge is to make the most of these advantages while minimizing drawbacks that could hurt operational speeds.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-hummer-ev-military-vehicle-elrv-181909646.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c5f97825-8418-4b7a-8319-b6d93ce77088</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 18:19:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636667525</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T21:52:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Military & Defense]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d2190f20-4313-11ec-bffe-3dc7aa709d1c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d2190f20-4313-11ec-bffe-3dc7aa709d1c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Fecht for GM Defense]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GM Defense President Steve duMont talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks Monday, Nov. 8, 2021 at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GM Defense President Steve duMont talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Discord pauses NFT plans following community backlash]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Discord doesn’t have impending plans to add NFT integrations, according to CEO Jason Citron. The clarification came on Wednesday following days of unrest stemming from a tweet Citron shared on November 8th. Replying to a message from investor Packy McCormick, the executive <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1457841222995693570?s=20"><ins>posted a screenshot</ins></a> of an unreleased Discord build with integrations to MetaMask and WalletConnect, two cryptocurrency wallet apps. “Probably nothing,” he said at the time. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/10/discord-nfts-crypto-jason-citron/"><em><ins>TechCrunch </ins></em><ins>points out</ins></a>, that’s shorthand in the NFT community for something that’s about to be a big deal.

The backlash was such that by Wednesday Citron and Discord were forced to issue a response. “Thanks for all the perspectives everyone,” he <a href="https://twitter.com/jasoncitron/status/1458607550677405699?s=20"><ins>said on Twitter</ins></a>. “We have no current plans to ship this internal concept.”</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, Discord shared an additional clarification:</p><blockquote><p>“We appreciate all the perspectives we’ve been hearing in response to the internal concept you may have seen in a tweet earlier this week and want to clarify we have no plans to ship it at this time. We’re excited about the potential for web3 technology and the positive ways these communities are coming together on Discord, especially those organized around environmentally friendly, creator-focused projects. However, we also recognize there are some problems we need to work through. For now we&#39;re focused on protecting users from spams, scams and fraud.”</p></blockquote><p>Uproar over a potential change is nothing new to the app space, but how loudly Discord users protested the company’s plans to integrate cryptocurrency wallets speaks to just how much those individuals love the platform. Discord <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-rebranding-151953314.html"><ins>grew by leaps and bounds</ins></a> during the pandemic in part because it offered a safe space for people to stay in touch with their friends while the world shut down.

In 2018, Google released the Pixel Slate, its attempt to jumpstart the market, but poorly optimized software and expensive hardware <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-30-google-pixel-slate-review.html">made the device a non-starter </a>for most people. Since then, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-20-google-is-giving-up-on-tablets.html">stopped making tablets entirely</a>, while most manufacturers making Chrome OS devices have also stuck with more traditional designs.</p><p>That started to change last year, when Lenovo built an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-150018759.html">inexpensive but useful Chrome OS tablet</a>, the Chromebook Duet. This year, HP has followed a similar pattern with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP Chromebook X2" href="https://fave.co/31MYhaR">HP Chromebook X2</a>, an 11-inch tablet that’s pricier and higher-end than Lenovo’s Duet (the model I’m reviewing costs $600). But, like the Duet, it uses a mobile processor (in this case, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c) and includes a keyboard and pen at no extra charge. Based purely on specs and design, the Chromebook X2 should be a fine performer — but is its convertible form factor worth the premium over a more standard laptop?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><h2></h2><p>We’ll get into how useful Chrome OS tablets are soon, but based purely on hardware alone, HP’s Chromebook X2 makes a great first impression. The tablet itself is a metal-clad slap that feels sturdy and well built. There’s a small camera bump on the back, along with metallic HP and Chrome logos, but overall it’s a simple device with few adornments. The device has squared-off sides with rounded corners, much like the iPad Pro and iPad Air, but it feels different enough from those devices despite the fact there are only so many ways to make a tablet.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a25a051-423e-11ec-8ebf-9cb08ad67941" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="5eade824-2648-3bfb-af4e-bf772055466f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>When looking at the front, you’ll notice a small camera on the top bezel, with stereo speakers positioned near the top of the screen. On the left side edge you’ll find two USB-C ports and a volume rocker. In the top left corner there’s a multi-function power button with a fingerprint reader. When you’re using the Chromebook X2 with a keyboard attached, pressing the power button shows options to shut down, log out or lock the device. When you’re using it as a tablet, though, the button has the more standard “lock the device and turn off the screen” function. The fingerprint scanner is easy to set up, and I wish that more Chromebooks had them.</p><p>The right side of the tablet is basically unadorned, aside from a mark that shows where you can magnetically attach the Chromebook X2’s pen to its side for easy access. The iPad Pro and various Microsoft Surface devices also let you magnetically attach a stylus, so this isn’t really a big innovation — but it’s still nice to have.</p><p>When I reviewed the Pixel Slate back in 2018, my main takeaway was that Chrome OS still required a keyboard. As such, I was glad to find that the Chromebook X2 had one included. To turn the X2 from a tablet into a functional laptop, HP designed a two-piece case. The keyboard cover goes on the front, much like Microsoft’s Surface Keyboard. But instead of having a built-in kickstand, the X2 has a second cover that serves as a kickstand which magnetically snaps on to the back. Once you have that set, the X2 is basically identical to the Microsoft Surface Go, at least in looks.</p><p>The Chromebook X2’s keyboard is pretty good considering it has to fit a relatively small device. The keys have solid travel and are quite responsive, though they’re a little bit loud. It feels a little cramped, but not any worse than the Surface Go’s keyboard. But it definitely feels more cramped than the Magic Keyboard I use with my 11-inch iPad Pro. (That’s a $300 accessory, though, so it really should be better than a keyboard HP includes with every X2.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a23cb90-423e-11ec-b7ed-4ae9258f1117" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="23095154-2083-32b7-bd67-31f697e0ad0a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>The main issue with the X2 keyboard is that it’s not ideal for using on your lap. As I’ve noticed with some other keyboard folios, applying just a little pressure on palm rests often causes the trackpad to register a click, which can be infuriating when you’re, say, typing a review and keep getting interrupted. It’s much better on a desk, where the keyboard is more stable. Microsoft’s Type Cover for the Surface lineup doesn’t have this problem, so it’s just a matter of build quality in the end. And for a small, light device meant to be used on the go, having a keyboard that only works on a hard, flat surface is less than ideal.</p><p>Despite occasional accidental clicks, the X2 trackpad is pretty good. It’s larger than the one on the iPad Pro’s Magic Keyboard and as well as the Surface Go’s keyboard, and it’s fast and responsive for both single-finger and multi-finger gestures. It’s still pretty small, though, so you might prefer an external mouse for extended work sessions.</p><p>The Chromebook X2 may be a small machine, but its 11-inch touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio is a standout. It’s a high-resolution display, coming in at 2,160 x 1,440, and the taller aspect ratio makes it feel a lot less cramped for work than a 16:9 screen would, especially at this smaller size. It’s also a very bright screen, almost painfully so — even when working in a sunny office, I rarely turned brightness up higher than halfway.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, HP included a stylus with the Chromebook X2. I’m no visual artist, so I’m not qualified to really judge its performance — but there’s no question stylus performance on this device lags behind Microsoft&#39;s Surface Go 3 and any iPad I’ve tried. But again, HP included a stylus for free, whereas Microsoft and Apple charge extra for it. That doesn’t make performance better, but at least you’re not shelling out additional cash for a sub-par experience. The pen might be fine for quick sketches or notes, but it doesn’t feel like something I’d want to use for very long.</p><h2>Tablet mode</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a25ee70-423e-11ec-853e-c4ee762ff3d1" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="a5f74fbd-9f1f-3c7e-b1a6-4a2f7d6f668a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Even though there aren’t many Chrome OS tablets, Google has made improvements to the OS’s tablet mode over the years. It’s quite a bit more stable and user-friendly than it was when the Pixel Slate came out in 2018; the main UI concepts are a mix of what you’ll find on iPadOS and Windows. Apps automatically launch in full screen, and the home screen is a grid of all the apps you have installed. Swiping up when you’re using an app brings you back to the home screen, and a more deliberate swipe from the bottom shows the Chrome OS dock. Finally, you can run two apps in  split-screen mode when you want to multitask.</p><p>I haven’t used the Chrome OS tablet mode in a while. I’ve reviewed a ton of Chromebooks with 360-degree hinges that can be used in tablet mode, but they’re usually too heavy for that. But the Chromebook X2 feels great in the hand;  with its 11-inch screen and a weight of 1.23 pounds, it’s not too big or heavy to be used as a tablet. The main issue with Chrome OS on a tablet is familiar to anyone who has used Android tablets: there just isn’t much software optimized for a large screen. That said, using the X2 to casually browse the web, watch videos and play the occasional game worked well. HP knows that this isn’t the primary way anyone should use a Chrome OS device, hence the included keyboard — but for casual couch browsing or watching a movie on a plan, the X2 does the trick.</p><h2>As a laptop</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a23cb90-423e-11ec-adfe-c09450ee5aaf" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="2f09af69-415a-3a62-90fa-37698c53fd7d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>The main way I used the Chromebook X2 was as a laptop, with the included keyboard attached. The biggest question I had was whether the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c processor was enough for my normal workflow. The answer was “more or less.” The X2 ran better than I expected, and I could usually have most of my normal apps running at all times. That means a couple Chrome windows with a handful of tabs in each, plus Chrome apps for Slack, Todoist, Keep, Trello and Tweetdeck. I also often had the Android version of Spotify running for music.</p><p>This all ran acceptably, but it definitely wasn’t the fastest — particularly if I had too many Chrome tabs going. The X2 that I tested has 8GB of RAM, and that helped keep most of my programs running without the need to refresh when I switched between them, but I ended up instinctively limiting how many tabs I had going at any given time to avoid pushing the X2 too hard. I also didn’t play music directly from the X2 much when I was running a lot of other apps, as I eventually would run into slowdowns or low memory skips if I had too much going on.</p><p>While I wish performance was a little better, it’s important to look at it in the context of how HP designed the device. Given its small size, I thought of it more as a secondary or travel computer rather than something most people would sit down and use for hours on end every single day. The display is certainly too small and performance not quite robust enough for me to use it that way, anyway.</p><p>One advantage of using a Snapdragon processor is that the Chromebook X2 had excellent battery life. While it’s too small of a computer for me to comfortably use all day long, I routinely got around eight hours of work when I used it as my primary machine, and still had charge left at the end of the day. It also performed extremely well in our battery drain test, which loops an HD video with the screen set at 50 percent brightness. The X2 lasted about 11 and a half hours in that test, which means this device should be a solid movie-watching companion if you’re on a long flight.</p><p>At only 1.23 pounds as a tablet and a little over 2.25 pounds with the keyboard and kickstand attached, the Chromebook X2 is an extremely portable computer for when you don’t need the full size and power that you get in a larger laptop. It again reminds me of Microsoft’s Surface Go 3, not just in the way it looks. Both devices are a bit underpowered, and I wouldn’t recommend either be someone’s primary computer. But, they can be great secondary computers if you’re aware of their limitations.</p><h2>Pricing and the competition</h2><h2></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a23f2a0-423e-11ec-bd9f-744075de96a9" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="3b1cdf7d-b4e0-38f2-b189-5e65f76033d5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Of course, price is a big part of the equation. That was probably the biggest problem with the Surface Go 3 when I reviewed it recently: The kit I tested cost $860, and for that money it should be powerful enough to use as your only computer. But the Chromebook X2 is cheaper; the model I reviewed costs $600. That gets you the aforementioned Snapdragon 7c processor, 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, the keyboard and pen. And the X2 has already been on sale numerous times at Best Buy for only $400. At that price, it’s a pretty great portable secondary computer.</p><p>At $600, it’s a little pricey for what you get, though. That’s mostly because you can buy a larger, more powerful Chromebook for a little more money. Both the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 and Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 cost $700 and come with faster Intel chips, better keyboards and larger displays. You have to be really committed to the tablet form factor to not give those computers a look instead. Or, you can get Lenovo’s Flex 5 Chromebook for only $300 on Amazon as of this writing; you’ll save yourself money and have a better overall experience. If you can find the Chromebook X2 on sale for $400, it’s a much more compelling buy, but it’s still not the best Chromebook in that price range.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a25a050-423e-11ec-ba7f-43d9bb8191f3" alt="HP&#39;s Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop." data-uuid="01c7b7d1-201b-3d42-a16b-b37a1fc438e0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><h2></h2><p>The main issue with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Chromebook X2" href="https://fave.co/31MYhaR">Chromebook X2</a> is neither its price nor its performance. It’s the fact that most people will be better served with a standard, laptop-style Chromebook. Sure, most Chromebooks are a little bigger and heavier than the X2, but they’re also generally more powerful and have better keyboards. The X2 only makes sense if you value portability and battery life over performance. If you can find the X2 for $400, it’s worth considering if you’re a Chrome OS user looking for a secondary computer that you can take with you anywhere. Otherwise, you’re probably better off considering one of the many other Chromebooks on the market.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hp-chromebook-x2-review-162005261.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">739ab1d7-972c-49aa-aa7a-c569491e2f58</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 16:20:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636651615</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T17:27:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tablets]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a268ab0-423e-11ec-bbff-816c3abcb4d2" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8a268ab0-423e-11ec-bbff-816c3abcb4d2" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HP's Chromebook X2 is a 2-in-1 convertible that works as both a tablet and a laptop.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HP Chromebook X2 review photos]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Radiohead's virtual 'Kid A Mnesia' exhibit is available November 18th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;ll soon have the chance to visit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/radiohead-and-epic-games-team-up-for-the-kid-a-mnesia-exhibit-215738766.html">Radiohead&#39;s virtual exhibition</a>. The band and Epic Games are releasing <em>Kid A Mnesia Exhibition</em> for free on November 18th for PS5, Windows PC and Mac. You can wishlist it on the <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/kid-a-mnesia-exhibition">Epic Games Store</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003085/">PlayStation Store</a>. As you can see from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkqVeyhdLYI">trailer</a>, the finished project is just what you&#39;d expect — it&#39;s a trippy 3D art gallery that blends <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-20-radiohead-public-library-and-rarities.html">Radiohead&#39;s music</a> from <em>Kid A</em> and <em>Amnesiac</em> (including new sound design from Nigel Godrich) with the unsettling artwork of Thom Yorke and Stanley Donwood.</p><p>The exhibit was originally meant to be physical, but a combination of &quot;laws of zoning and physics and COVID-19&quot; (according to Epic) pushed it to the digital realm. Radiohead, Godrich and Donwood teamed with Namethemachine, Arbitrarily Good Productions, artist Sean Evans and theater set designer Christine Jones to create the exhibition. Epic is publishing the end result.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is clearly a plug for the <em>Kid A Mnesia</em> album that includes both albums and a string of previously unreleased material. At the same time, it might be worthwhile even if you&#39;re only casually familiar with Radiohead&#39;s tunes.

Beaumont added that Microsoft is continuing to improve the app&#39;s performance, including &quot;making it more reliable to download and play your games.&quot; The team&#39;s also trying to make it easier for developers to add features like cross-saves and achievements.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/windows-store-xbox-game-pass-update-install-folder-154724715.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2d3fb0e6-1212-4828-b382-3e55a63db2ca</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 15:47:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636645219</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T15:40:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ce81d1e0-4303-11ec-bbda-97b144a99fce" width="1155" height="665" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ce81d1e0-4303-11ec-bbda-97b144a99fce" width="1155" height="665" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot of the Xbox app on Windows 10, including a tile promoting Forza Horizon 5.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The Windows Xbox app]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[All the 'fun' gifts our grown-up staff would like to receive]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We at Engadget spend a lot of time thinking about the best tech gifts for anyone and everyone in your life.

When I was eventually given one, I spent hours doting on my virtual pet, doing my best to keep it alive and happy. Even now, a couple of decades and the addition of one cat later, there remains a soft spot in my heart for Bandai’s egg-shaped toy. Although I’d probably have less patience now for a beeping Tamagotchi in distress, I’d be overjoyed if someone dropped one onto my doorstep like a proverbial stork with a baby basket. Part of me wants to see how long I can keep the thing alive, and part of me wants to once again experience that childlike wonder inspired by a new toy that will, inevitably, suck up time that I don’t have to spare. <em>— Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3mp2nN7" id="d42f90e390a047308edded0afcf71e1a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Tamagotchi at Amazon - $20</a><h2>Dyson V11 Animal cordless vacuum</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3276ffb0-2ddb-11ec-8fbd-2b79a53aa66d" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide." data-uuid="d7fe8e56-336c-3861-870d-9a0bf2dd0bb0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dyson </div></figure><p>One of the ways you know you’re a full-fledged adult is when a new vacuum excites you.

It is, without a doubt, the best vacuum I’ve ever owned even if it’s slightly less convenient than a robot vacuum that I can set and forget. The suction power is remarkable — it captures cat hair that I can’t even see around my apartment — and the various adapters that it comes with lets me clean my couch, cushions and even hard to reach areas like baseboards and room corners. It has three cleaning modes with various suction levels and battery lives, but I’ve never had to stop mid-cleaning to charge it.</p><p>But you may struggle to find the V11 Torque right now.

A prime example is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-oled-notebooks-proart-zenbook-vivobook-160009335.html">Studiobook 16 OLED H5600 laptop</a>, tempting artists with high performance, a beautiful 16-inch 4K OLED display, and an “ASUS dial” for video or photo editing.</p><p>ASUS’s previous ProArt laptops like the StudioBook One were workstation-like creator devices with expensive parts like NVIDIA Quadro 6000 GPUs. With this model, ASUS is focusing more on bang-for-the buck with components like an RTX 3070 GPU and AMD Ryzen 9 eight-core CPU. (The more expensive <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:StudioBook 16 Pro" href="https://fave.co/3kuNUyZ">StudioBook 16 Pro</a> models offer Xeon processors and Quadro GPUs.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The question is, can a reasonably priced laptop like this keep up with more expensive models or even high-end gaming laptops when it comes to performance? To find out, I got a hold of a well-specced but modestly priced Studiobook 16 OLED model and put it to work on some photo and video editing jobs.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5c977582-7e9e-4c34-a794-a198f15b01cc"/><p>A key feature of all the Studiobook devices is the businesslike looks that are far away from ASUS’s gaming designs. To that end, it has a basic black, square-edged body with the only noticeable design touch being the subtle ProArt logo on top. It has bezels that are reasonably small but not what I’d call thin, and isn’t the lightest or smallest 16-inch laptop out there. Still, with a .77-inch thickness and 5.28 pound heft, it’s relatively compact — especially considering that it offers “military-grade durability” (MIL-STD 810H), according to ASUS.</p><p>ASUS has developed an “IceCool Pro” thermal solution that’s supposed to boost airflow by up to 16 percent, while keeping noise levels below 40 dbA in standard cooling mode. It does that through the use of dual 102-blade fans, six heat pipes and multiple ducts.</p><p>If you need more punch, you can switch to performance mode which boosts power to 95 watts, or up to 135 watts in “full-speed” mode. Fan noise is still reasonable in performance mode unless you’re doing GPU/CPU intensive chores, but the full-speed setting can get very loud indeed. Still, it could be a handy mode if you’re planning to leave the room while doing a render. Overall, heat and noise are very well managed.</p><p>The headline feature on this laptop is the 3,480 x 2,400 16:10 OLED display, the first on a 16-inch laptop, ASUS claims. As you’d expect, it’s sharp, vibrant and beautiful in person — by far the best laptop display I’ve ever seen in terms of fidelity and “wow” factor.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04dfdc50-4241-11ec-bfff-96ac54a6957d" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="4e23971a-03e8-3e33-adda-d789a9ce9a7f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The panel is factory-calibrated to Pantone and Calman color accuracy, with a delta E of less than two, a fact that I confirmed with my X-Rite i1 Display Pro calibrator. I used it with a $4,000 ASUS mini-LED ProArt monitor and despite the display technology differences, they matched very closely to my eyes, color wise.</p><p>The true 10-bit panel offers 100 percent DCI-P3 color coverage, in workstation laptop territory and well beyond rivals like the MacBook Pro (78 percent) and Dell’s XPS 15 (85 percent). Along with the color accuracy, that allows for precise color correction controls in apps like DaVinci Resolve and Adobe Lightroom Classic. The 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio with inky OLED blacks also makes it ideal for content creation, with a side benefit that it’s the best entertainment laptop I’ve ever used.</p><p>Given that the display is suitable for color correction, ASUS should have perhaps included a way to easily change the color profile for video editing ( Rec.709, DCI-P3 and so on) or photos (AdobeRGB, sRGB). That could be a handy setting in the Creator Hub, for example, or at least as an .icm profile for Windows Color Management.</p><p>You can crank the brightness up to 550 nits in HDR mode, so it conforms to VESA’s DisplayHDR <a href="https://displayhdr.org/#tab-true-black-500">True Black 500</a> standard for OLED displays — very bright indeed for a laptop display. However, it’s well short of the 1,600 nits peak brightness available on the latest MacBook Pros, which use mini-LED displays. That raises the question of whether OLED or mini-LED is more desirable on a creator laptop, but personally, I’d take the superior OLED blacks over eye-scorching brightness and haloing.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04cb1bd0-4241-11ec-a776-ac799f77b799" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="adae389f-a276-36c5-be1b-92cc798b4ba2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The other attention-grabbing feature is the ProArt Dial. I wouldn’t blame you for thinking it’s a gimmick, as it takes up space and adds complexity. Also, similar control surfaces can look cool but often end up in drawers, never to be used.</p><p>This one has a few things in its favor, though. It feels nice thanks to the textured grip, smooth rotation and clicky detents. Mainly, though, it’s just convenient as it’s located directly below the keyboard. In that way, it makes more sense than something like Microsoft’s Surface Dial or an external <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-10-palette-video-editing-controls-hands-on.html">control surface</a>, as those are usually placed outside easy grabbing distance.</p><p>With no apps loaded, you can use the dial to turn up the sound or increase monitor brightness more easily than using the function keys. To make the most of it, though, you really need Adobe’s Creative Cloud suite. With Photoshop open, pressing the dial launches a dedicated pie chart-like menu with “slices” for brush options, layer zoom, and so on. Pressing it again on the brush menu, for instance, opens sub-options for hardness, flow, opacity and more. Premiere and After Effects have similar custom menus.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04caf4c1-4241-11ec-ba59-871681a7807c" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="94ca8ad6-7681-331d-9e20-2d010ee888f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>If the stock menus won’t do, you can go into the ASUS ProArt Creator Hub software. There, you can reprogram the functions the way you’d prefer via drop-down menus. As it stands now, the dial only supports four Adobe apps: Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects and Lightroom Classic. As someone who uses other apps, particularly DaVinci Resolve, I’m hoping ASUS will add more down the road.</p><p>I’ve used control surfaces in the past as part of my former video editor career, but I haven’t been a big fan of them on PCs. However, after trying the ASUS dial with Photoshop and Premiere Pro, I got used to it pretty fast. It was natural to keep one hand on the keyboard and the other on the dial to jog video, swap tools and so on. Before long, it was second nature and sped up my workflow.</p><p>Moving to the front of the laptop, the trackpad is smooth, responsive and sports not just two, but three buttons — taking me back to the 2000s when all PC mice had this. The third one adds an extra control that could be useful for 3D or CAD apps, video editing to mark “in” points and so on. It’s also the first laptop touchpad from ASUS that supports styluses using the MPP 1.51 standard, which includes its own. That allows artists to use the touchpad as a precise drawing tablet. I wasn’t able to make use of this functionality myself (I can’t really draw), but it’s nice to have it there.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04ff4b32-4241-11ec-b96b-ee865275a588" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="d44f6703-5900-327a-b305-201ac0acfdbc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The keyboard has decent travel and a nice amount of spring back, and offers a separate number pad that’s nice to have. However, the entire keyboard is shifted upwards more than usual and the keys are perhaps a touch small, because the ASUS dial effectively increases the space between the touchpad and keyboard. I got used to it pretty quickly, though, and it was never bothersome.</p><p>Port-wise, it’s well-equipped with two fast USB-C 3.2 gen2 10Gbps connections, two USB-A 3.2 gen 2, HDMI 2.1, an audio jack and RJ45 ethernet. The HDMI 2.1 jack is nice, as it allows you to connect, say, a supported TV and get 4K at up to 120 fps. It’s good that one of the USB-C ports supports DisplayPort, because a lot of monitors only work with that standard. However, given that creators often connect tons of gadgets, I would have liked to see an extra USB-A port or two, though.</p><p>It’s nice that ASUS incorporated a bleeding edge SD Express card slot that can read data from supported cards at an awesome 985 MB/s. There’s a rather huge problem, though. If you insert an SD UHS II card used by tons of cameras, the StudioBook will only read it at UHS-I speeds — 100 MB/s instead of 300 MB/s. Since no cameras support SD Express yet, I’d rather have seen a standard UHS-II slot. (Hopefully that will change, as Sony, Nikon and Canon are part of the SD Express consortium.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04b549e0-4241-11ec-aa6b-cad7c4674536" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="c6801961-64ec-3d2a-90ee-30afa69d2f6f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>For sound, ASUS incorporated an audiophile-grade ESS Sabre DAC, promising lower distortion and expanded dynamic range. There are only a pair of speakers rather than four or more like on some recent laptops. However, they’re well above average for a laptop like this, with decent mid-range sound and acceptable bottom end. Other features include a fingerprint reader on the power button along with a top-mounted IR HD webcam with Windows Hello support and a privacy shutter.</p><p>Now, let’s talk about performance. The top-end ProArt StudioBook OLED 16 I’m testing uses the RTX 3070 mobile GPU, rather than the top-end RTX 3080. I don’t have a problem with that, as an RTX 3080 wouldn’t speed up creative apps much and adds cost and heat. Everything else is high-end, though. It’s got AMD’s top mobile 8-core Ryzen 5900HX chip, 32GB of RAM, and two terabytes of NVME storage in Raid 0. It currently comes with Windows 10 Pro, but ASUS will offer Windows 11 upgrades early next year.</p><p>I ran the ProArt StudioBook through our usual battery of performance tests, including PCMark 10 for productivity, 3DMark’s Time Spy for 3D performance, Atto’s diskbench and others.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p>None</p></td><td><p>PCMark 10</p></td><td><p>3DMark (TimeSpy Extreme)</p></td><td><p>Geekbench 5</p></td><td><p>ATTO (top reads/writes)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS ProArt StudioBook 16 OLED H5600 (Ryzen 5900HX, NVIDIA RTX 3070)</p></td><td><p>6,954</p></td><td><p>4,604</p></td><td><p>1,499/9,053</p></td><td><p>5.61 GB/s / 5.35 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus G15 (AMD Ryzen 9 5900HS, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>6,881</p></td><td><p>4,530</p></td><td><p>1,426/7,267</p></td><td><p>3.3 GB/s / 2.85 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>MSI GS66 Stealth (2021, Intel i7-10870H, NVIDIA RTX 3080 Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,369</p></td><td><p>4,538</p></td><td><p>1,247/6,505</p></td><td><p>3.1 GB/s / 2.9 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Gigabyte Aero 17 HDR XB (Intel i7-10875H, NVIDIA RTX 2070 Super Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,155</p></td><td><p>3,495</p></td><td><p>1,137/5,681</p></td><td><p>2.93 GB/s / 2.59 GB/s</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>ASUS Zephyrus Duo 15 (Intel i9-10980HK, NVIDIA RTX 2080 Super Max-Q)</p></td><td><p>5,616</p></td><td><p>3,680</p></td><td><p>1,365/8,055</p></td><td><p>3 GB/s / 3.24 GB/s</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="" style="margin-bottom:10px;color:rgb(32, 43, 51);">It performed near the top in all of them, as shown in the chart above, particularly the disk speeds. With the RAID 0 NVMe storage, disk speeds are stupendously fast, with reads at 5.6 GB/s and writes at 5.35 GB/s. It can’t be overstated how much that helps disk-intensive apps like Premiere Pro.</p><p>I also ran tests more geared to content creation, like Maxon&#39;s Cinebench R23 and Puget Systems’ <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/">PugetBench</a> for Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Davinci Resolve. The PugetBench tests offer decent real-world results, as they automatically loop a series of functions that test effects, encoding, playback and so on. Again, I saw top-notch results compared to other recent creative and gaming laptops.</p><p>For instance, it hit 938 on the <a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/PugetBench-for-DaVinci-Resolve-1523/">PugetBench DaVinci Resolve</a> extended overall test, a result that stacked up with many desktop machines. Other scores included a 981 on PugetBench Photoshop 22 CC, compared to 781 for the Dell XPS 15 OLED and 998 for Lenovo’s ThinkPad P15 Gen 2. Like most other laptops, though, it was handily bested by Apple’s M1 Max MacBook Pro, scoring 698 on the PugetBench Premiere Pro Standard test, compared to 821 for the MacBook.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04cacdb0-4241-11ec-8ffb-107313e4fd0d" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="89baf665-f6c8-31bd-91de-0e5c35e4e93c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Gaming is not this laptop’s <em>raison d’être</em>, but I did some anyway, and it acquitted itself beautifully with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Destiny 2</em> and other titles. Frame rates were decent for 4K laptop gaming, though I needed to knock the detail settings well back. The 4K screen is a limiting factor, of course, because of the 60Hz refresh rate.</p><p>Synthetic benchmarks and gaming are fine, but creativity laptops need to prove themselves at work, too. To that end, I edited a camera review video for the laptop using DaVinci Resolve 17.2, and this video on the latest version of Premiere Pro. I also dipped into Photoshop, After Effects and Lightroom.</p><p>Again, the ProArt Studiobook acquitted itself with honors, offering fluid 4K editing, even with GPU-intensive camera codecs. I was able to export 4K videos at nearly 300 percent real-time speed in Resolve (NVIDIA encoder, MP4, 4K, 12,000 Kbps max data rate), with color correction, text and other light effects on nearly every shot.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04ff4b30-4241-11ec-b75e-21677d6a7cb2" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="d6948c7e-6955-3c6a-8500-ffd4cdcf8b3a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>For a desktop-replacement laptop that will often run off wall power, the StudioBook has surprisingly good battery life. It ran for 6 hours and 20 minutes in our 1080p video loop rundown test and even longer for normal browsing and work chores — excellent considering the 4K display. The AMD Ryzen 9 chip’s efficiency likely helps a lot here.</p><p>That beats most 4K PC laptops, with the exception of Dell’s XPS 15 OLED model that could go over 9 hours between charges. However, it gets stomped by the $2,500 16-inch MacBook Pro M1 Max, which lasted a ridiculous 16 hours and 34 minutes in our tests. Yes, that model has slightly lower screen resolution, but it lasted over 2.5 times longer.</p><p>The StudioBook 16 OLED was relatively quiet during all these chores as well, with the fan only kicking in on complex scenes or exports. Even then, it was considerably quieter than my Gigabyte Aero 15X laptop. If you need maximum rendering performance and don’t need to stay in the room, you can select the “full-speed” setting that cranks the fans to the maximum speed.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/04ff2421-4241-11ec-9fdd-b8427b984d60" alt="ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop" data-uuid="7c4e1191-0346-3262-9f86-56f7aa3a5230"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>In the end, is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16" href="https://fave.co/3kuNUyZ">ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16</a> OLED laptop worth getting over rival creative models or a comparably equipped gaming laptop? Without a doubt.</p><p>It’s not just fast, but smooth and reliable across creative chores — and the “reliable” part is key for production-oriented laptops. It handles 4K editing and large photos without getting overly hot and noisy. It’s not even a bad gaming machine, though the 60Hz 4K screen isn’t ideal for that.</p><p>For the cost of the OLED model, you really get a lot. The model I’m working with will run around $3,000, though ASUS still hasn’t nailed down the final pricing yet. It also offers a better spec list than any rival creative laptops unless you’re willing to go way up in price. And don’t forget that the StudioBook has features not found on any laptop, creative or otherwise, like the 16-inch 4K OLED display and ProArt dial.</p><p>The MacBook Pro models with the M1 Pro and M1 Max CPUs are making things more interesting for potential creative laptop buyers. They’re much more competitive than the Intel MacBook Pros, as they’re faster, quieter and have longer battery life. However, as Engadget has discovered in testing, the new MacBooks are better than PC laptops like the Studiobook 16 in some ways (battery and video playback) and worse in others (rendering, GPU performance in general). More on that soon in an upcoming Upscaled.</p><p>Still, for the money, the ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED is the best Windows 10 content creation laptop you can get right now. I haven’t been excited about too many laptops lately, but I can’t recommend this model enough.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-pro-art-studiobook-16-oled-review-the-best-windows-creator-laptop-150041474.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">56911ecd-f0dc-44b5-ac88-c5585a977947</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 15:00:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636643338</ingested><modified>2021-11-11T15:09:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/708a1340-4240-11ec-bdfb-225011f29bb8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/708a1340-4240-11ec-bdfb-225011f29bb8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ProArt Studiobook 16 OLED review: The best Windows creator laptop]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rittenhouse defense incorrectly claims iPad pinch-to-zoom modifies footage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A lack of technical knowledge may have just influenced an important court case. <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/us/kyle-rittenhouse-video-zoom.html">reports</a> the defense for shooter Kyle Rittenhouse incorrectly claimed that an iPad&#39;s pinch-to-zoom function could modify footage of the incident, &quot;creating what it thinks is there, not what necessarily is there.&quot; That sparked a debate between lawyers and Judge Schroeder, who maintained the burden was on the prosecution to show the imagery remained in its &quot;virginal state,&quot; not on the defense to prove manipulation.</p><p>The judge may have accepted the argument. He denied the prosecution&#39;s request for an adjournment and instead called for a 15-minute recess, suggesting the team could find an expert to support their claim in that space of time.

The half-mask design means it’s easy to get on and off without messing with your helmet, and the built in ear flaps keep it in place while keeping your ears nice and toasty. I started wearing mine last year when many resorts were requiring guests to mask up in lift lines due to COVID-19. I wasn’t disappointed: the fleece was way more comfortable than the standard cloth or surgical mask, which are pretty miserable in cold or wet conditions. But after wearing it for an entire season, I’m ready to ditch all my other ski masks for good and keep this in my ski bag for seasons to come.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2X48b5W" id="7e7279ad7a1142efbc0bfdb17c2ecfab" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy half face mask at Amazon - $11</a><h2>Ministry of Supply Mercury jacket</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/427f5b61-2dc6-11ec-adfb-963db2da7847" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide" data-uuid="627d1c59-799b-3d1d-b563-6f69f92a4e44"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ministry of Supply </div></figure><p>At $500, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Ministry of Supply&#x002019;s Mercury Jacket" href="https://fave.co/3lBkccM">Ministry of Supply’s Mercury Jacket</a> is definitely one of the pricier pieces of outerwear you can buy, but it’s much more than just a jacket. The Mercury has three, strategically placed carbon fiber heating elements woven into the lining of the jacket.

That may not sound like something you need every day, but the Mercury is surprisingly versatile. It’s insulated and looks good enough on its own that you can wear it on warmer days, but the heater means you can keep it on even when conditions get colder.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3lBkccM" id="cdbe5ca6bc2744579166e67082ffb2bc" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Ministry of Supply;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Mercury jacket at Ministry of Supply - $500</a><h2>Outdoor Research Gripper gloves</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/427f0d40-2dc6-11ec-95fe-ddebb43acacd" alt="Items for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide" data-uuid="99c321ce-8591-39ad-bf6a-9c358e68c749"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Outdoor Research</div></figure><p>If you’re looking for a high-performance winter glove, it doesn’t get any better than the wind and waterproof Gore-Tex.
