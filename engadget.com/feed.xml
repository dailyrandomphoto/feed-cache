With people stuck at home last year, services saw millions of new subscribers — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html">Netflix attracted 16 million customers in just three months</a>, alone. The early part of 2021 continued that trend, but as the year draws to a close, it appears <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/disney-netflix-and-other-streaming-services-subs-arpu-q3-2021.html">the growth is slowing down across the board</a>. This suggests that as restrictions ease around the world, people might be returning to pre-pandemic norms.</p><p>But on the whole, 2021 was still a pretty big year for streaming. Netflix now has <a href="https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/netflix-now-has-214-million-global-subscribers/">214 million global subscribers</a>, and services like Disney+ and HBO Max lured customers with exclusive TV shows and movies. US platforms, like Peacock, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peacock-uk-ireland-sky-now-tv-streaming-164859612.html">expanded internationally</a> and online-only programming was well-represented at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-beats-all-studios-with-seven-oscars-064216443.html">multiple award shows</a>. Titles exclusive to streaming, such as <em>Squid Game</em> and <em>WandaVision</em>, became part of the cultural landscape. A slow year or not, it’s clear that this is how most of us watch our shows now. Here are some of the biggest stories in streaming this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/efcc47a0-5efa-11ec-bfdd-2e3905269833" alt="Squid Game" data-uuid="a652d448-7ba3-3d4d-bfef-0b741805a14f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Netflix</div></figure><h3>Netflix continues to dominate</h3><p>As mentioned above, Netflix is the undisputed leader in streaming with over 214 million subscribers worldwide. Sure, it’s faced a few challenges from rivals like Disney+ and Amazon Prime, but Netflix is still holding strong. Part of that is due to the company’s strategy of investing in original content that you can’t get anywhere else, like <em>Stranger Things</em> and <em>The Crown</em>.</p><p>And of course, there’s <em>Squid Game</em> which is undoubtedly the number one TV show of the year. Netflix has said that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-142-million-households-squid-game-070044407.html">around 142 million households</a> watched the Korean-language show, making it the most-viewed new show in Netflix history. There’s also the recently released <em>Red Notice</em>, which became <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/red-notice-netflix-all-time-most-popular-movie-1235118477/">the service’s most-watched movie</a> in its first 28 days of release, with around 328.8 million viewing hours in that time span. That tops the previous record held by <em>Bird Box</em>, which had 282 million viewing hours back in 2018.</p><p>Things don’t seem to be slowing down, either. Netflix has signed multi-year deals with big names like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-kevin-hart-agree-to-a-multiyear-film-deal-231147872.html">Kevin Hart</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steven-spielberg-netflix-ambiln-175031862.html">Steven Spielberg</a>, it has exclusive rights for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-exclusive-rights-universal-animated-films-105446842.html">Universal animated films</a> and it purchased <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-reportedly-purchasing-the-rights-to-roald-dahls-entire-catalog-091947985.html">the rights to Roald Dahl’s entire catalog</a>. this phenomenon</p><p>Still, 2021 wasn’t without its hiccups. The largest one by far is when Netflix employees <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/business/media/netflix-dave-chappelle-employee-walkout.html">staged a protest</a> over the CEO’s remarks defending Dave Chappelle’s standup special, which was heavily criticized for its transphobic content. CEO Ed Sarandos has since said he “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-ceo-says-he-screwed-up-internal-communication-over-dave-chappelle-special-080412118.html">screwed up</a>” on the messaging, but has not rescinded his defense.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d61bda60-5ef9-11ec-bfbd-1813cc4e3f80" alt="Loki" data-uuid="c1462c7d-056a-3e8f-a51a-2882e662904f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Disney</div></figure><h3>Disney+ proves it’s a serious contender</h3><p>Disney+, on the other hand, currently has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-q4-2021-earnings-subscribers-215350017.html">118.1 million</a> paid subscribers worldwide, which doesn’t quite compare to Netflix. But the service still gained ground in 2021, with <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1095372/disney-plus-number-of-subscribers-us/">around 43 million more subscribers</a> compared to last year. A lot of that can be attributed to Disney’s powerhouse brands such as Pixar, Star Wars and, especially in 2021, Marvel.</p><p>2021 was when the Marvel Cinematic Universe released four different TV shows, all exclusively on Disney+: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html"><em>WandaVision</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-first-episode-marvel-universe-153051805.html"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-loki-finale-episode-six-163019038.html"><em>Loki</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-hawkeye-trailer-premiere-date-clint-barton-kate-bishop-hailee-steinfeld-140006373.html"><em>Hawkeye</em></a>. This is a big deal, as Marvel has said that these TV series are key to the MCU’s “Phase Four” chapter, indicating that fans will likely want to watch them in order to understand the context behind upcoming movies set in the same universe.</p><p>But there was more to these shows that made them required viewing. As the first out the gate, <em>WandaVision</em> set the tone. The episodes were meant to be watched weekly, as each one spurred so-called “water cooler” discussions in-person and online. This felt a lot like “anti-binging” TV, as much of the appeal of these shows lay in the anticipation of what would happen next. At the very least, it showed that Disney+’s slate of original content — which also includes <em>The Mandalorian</em> and the upcoming <em>The Book of Boba Fett</em> — could hold its own against that of more established platforms.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/98823320-5ef9-11ec-bb6b-355061f8bb40" alt="Wonder Woman 1984" data-uuid="506c6720-7300-393d-9af3-636095e4481a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. </div></figure><h3>The direct-to-streaming revolution that wasn’t</h3><p>During the thick of the pandemic, many movies eschewed theatrical releases for direct-to-streaming debuts. Examples include <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-22-paramount-the-lovebirds-direct-to-netflix.html"><em>The Lovebirds</em></a>, <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/g31871914/movies-streaming-early-coronavirus/"><em>Borat Subsequent Movie Film</em>,</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-mulan-date-232629863.html"><em>Mulan</em></a> (via paid Premier Access), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-pixar-soul-224512241.html"><em>Soul</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wonder-woman-hbo-max-december-25-234420280.html"><em>Wonder Woman 1984</em></a>. That carried into this year as well, with Disney+ continuing its paid Premier Access model with <em>Cruella</em>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-184407477.html"><em>Black Widow</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-rock-jungle-cruise-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-170319455.html"><em>Jungle Cruise</em></a> (<em>Luca</em>, however, did not have Premier Access release).</p><p>The biggest move, however, was when Warner Bros. announced that every single one of its movies in 2021 would have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/every-2021-warner-bros-film-will-simulcast-on-hbo-max-and-in-theaters-184336206.html">one month exclusive access period on HBO Max</a> concurrent with the film’s domestic release. This meant that big blockbuster movies like <em>Suicide Squad</em>, <em>Dune</em> and <em>Matrix 4</em> would be available on HBO Max on the same day they debuted in theaters <em>for an entire year</em>.</p><p>While some may have heralded this phenomenon as the future of entertainment, it looks to be short-lived. Disney revealed a few months ago that all of its remaining 2021 movies will get a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html">45-day head start</a> in theaters. This could be due to strong responses to titles like <em>Free Guy</em> and <em>Shang-Chi</em>, but Disney might also want to avoid lawsuits like the one <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-settles-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit-black-widow-024836370.html">Scarlett Johansson filed</a> for breach of contract over shortened theatrical releases. Warner Bros. also said that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming-2022-161147104.html">it’s going back to theater-first releases in 2022</a>. It looks like the direct-to-streaming revolution isn’t quite here just yet.</p><h3>Other notable streaming news</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/paramount-plus-launch-date-161702061.html">Paramount+ replaces CBS All Access</a>, which essentially opens up the service to other ViacomCBS channels, such as Comedy Central and VH1, plus Paramount’s existing movie library.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/discovery-plus-now-available-roku-amazon-fire-181032400.html">Discovery+ makes its debut</a>. The service features content from HGTV, Food Network, Animal Planet, TLC, the Magnolia Network, and Discovery.</p></li><li><p>AT&amp;T spun off its WarnerMedia division and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/att-spins-off-warner-media-in-a-merger-deal-with-discovery-123716979.html">merged it with Discovery</a> in a $43 billion deal. The new company will combine Warner’s film division, HBO Max and Discovery+.</p></li><li><p>Roku purchased Quibi’s shows and released some of them as “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-originals-quibi-may-20th-streaming-day-130016440.html">Roku Originals</a>.”</p></li><li><p>Roku <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-removes-youtube-tv-google-contract-dispute-143232936.html">pulled YouTube TV</a> from its channel store amid a contract dispute with Google. The latter apparently requested priority placement in search results and wanted to block results from other providers while the app was in use. As of December 8th, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-is-finally-coming-back-to-roku-after-after-a-protracted-feud-140010882.html">both parties have finally agreed</a> to a multi-year extension.</p></li><li><p>In other notable YouTube TV news, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-loses-access-to-disney-channels-083536190.html">the service recently lost access to all of Disney&#39;s channels</a>, which includes ESPN, ABC and FX, as Google and Disney had failed to strike a deal. After just a couple of days, however, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-disney-channels-back-espn-abc-213518747.html">two companies reconciled and reached an agreement</a>, thus restoring all of the aforementioned channels. When YouTube TV initially lost those channels, Google had dropped the price of the service by $15 (from $65 to $50 in the basic package). Now the price is back to normal. However, if users had already initiated the cancellation process, Google will still honor the one-time $15 credit if they resume their membership.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/wwe-network-peacock-exclusive-streaming-us-155406623.html">WWE Network</a> ceased operations as most of its content moved to Peacock.</p></li><li><p>Peacock aired multiple live <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wwe-network-peacock-exclusive-streaming-us-155406623.html">Olympics</a> sporting events as well as the opening and closing ceremonies.</p></li><li><p>Universal made a deal where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wwe-network-peacock-exclusive-streaming-us-155406623.html">Peacock</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-video-universal-pictures-movies-peacock-183143573.html">Amazon Prime Video</a> would have some streaming rights for its live-action movies after their theatrical run. They would air on Peacock for four months, then on Prime Video for 10 months, and then back to Peacock for at least another four months. This kicks into effect in 2022.</p></li><li><p>Netflix gained <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-netflix-exclusive-deal-182221930.html">exclusive streaming rights</a> to all of Sony’s upcoming movies, including upcoming titles in the Spider-Man franchise.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/peacock-sky-uk-ireland-launch-1235112327/">Peacock debuts</a> in the UK and Ireland.</p></li></ul><h3>What to look forward to in 2022</h3><p>While the growth in streaming might be slowing, there are still plenty of shows and movies to anticipate next year. Netflix has confirmed that the aforementioned <em>Sandman</em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=netflix+2022+witcher+blood+origin+stranger+things&amp;rlz=1C5GCEA_enUS908US908&amp;sxsrf=AOaemvIrIpB7grzhtMZBytqeZtg5N9SOUA%3A1639540764819&amp;ei=HGi5Yd-zMdi7tAbdlarIAw&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfsYan9eT0AhXYHc0KHd2KCjkQ4dUDCA4&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=netflix+2022+witcher+blood+origin+stranger+things&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAMyBQghEKsCMgUIIRCrAjIFCCEQqwI6BwgAEEcQsAM6CAghEBYQHRAeOgUIIRCgAUoECEEYAEoECEYYAFDuA1i5DGCiDWgBcAJ4AIABggGIAbANkgEENS4xMZgBAKABAcgBCMABAQ&amp;sclient=gws-wiz">will be released in 2022</a>, as well as <em>The Witcher: Blood Origin</em> and new seasons of favorites like <em>Stranger Things</em>, <em>The Crown</em> and <em>Ozark</em>. Disney+ will continue its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-23-disney-plus-ms-marvel-she-hulk-moon-knight.html">MCU run of TV shows</a> with <em>Ms. Marvel</em>, and will introduce a couple of Star Wars series too: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-obi-wan-kenobi-baymax-173811314.html"><em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em></a> and <em>Andor</em>. Perhaps the two biggest TV series to get excited about, however, are HBO’s Game of Thrones prequel series, <a href="https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a>, and Amazon’s epic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-series-release-date-184156740.html"><em>Lord of the Rings</em> series</a>, which is set thousands of years prior to <em>The Hobbit</em>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/state-of-streaming-2021-143056372.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3a0688c-cd26-4dda-b21d-92e419e90250</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 14:30:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640093040</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T13:24:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d923a6b0-5efa-11ec-bfbd-c53624d39063" width="4500" height="3000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d923a6b0-5efa-11ec-bfbd-c53624d39063" width="4500" height="3000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YANTAI, CHINA - NOVEMBER 13 2021: Workers dressed like characters in the Netflix series Squid Game pose to entertain visitors in a shopping mall in Yantai city in east China&#039;s Shandong province Saturday, Nov. 13, 2021.

Now, it appears that the effort is a financial bust so far, too, as the company reportedly sold just 15 NFTs of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-recon-breakpoint-players-can-invite-friends-to-join-them-for-free-212500525.html"><em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em></a> gun skin as of yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-20-ubisoft-appears-to-have-sold-a-grand-total-of-15-nfts"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> reported.

As of today, Ubisoft appears to have minted about somewhere north of 3,000 NFTs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="af45465962ac489cb4d59d2b315076fc"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">am i understanding this right? ubisoft managed to make an nft that not even nft fans want? because that is very very very funny</p>— Liz Edwards (@lizaledwards) <a href="https://twitter.com/lizaledwards/status/1472785306889773056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Ubisoft launched the first three <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em> Editions for free, with the weapon requiring XP Level 4, the helmet greater than 600 hours of play time, and the pants at least 100 hours of play time. Those went pretty quickly and the claim period ended, so the only way to get them now is to pay.&nbsp;</p><p>As some critics have pointed out, <em>Breakpoint</em> doesn&#39;t have the most alluring visual aesthetic, so it seems an odd choice to kick off an NFT for visual collectibles. On the other hand, Ubisoft may have been just dipping its toe into the water with one of its less high-profile, though still popular franchises.&nbsp;</p><p>For the minimum money collected so far, however, the effort may have done more harm than good. Ubisoft reportedly alienated its own French trade union, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-12-16-french-trade-union-calls-ubisoft-nft-scheme-a-useless-costly-ecologically-mortifying-technology">called NFTs</a> &quot;a useless, costly, ecologically mortifying tech.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-nft-quartz-ghost-recon-blockchain-140720063.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03fe03c4-70b5-4330-bdf1-6524d09ef5a0</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 14:07:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640095946</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T14:12:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ba48bab0-625a-11ec-aeff-37f58a4197d1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ba48bab0-625a-11ec-aeff-37f58a4197d1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ubisoft's NFT sales apparently aren't going so well]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ubisoft's NFT sales apparently aren't going so well]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tiffany Haddish is getting her own Supernatural VR workout]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Popular virtual reality workout app <em>Supernatural</em> is partnering with comedian Tiffany Haddish to release a new workout series.

As for the fourth-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-12-amazon-echo-dot-kids-edition-freetime-2019.html">Echo Dot for Kids</a>, its original retail price is $60, but it&#39;s been listed for $35 since November.

You (or the kid&#39;s parents or guardian) can give the recipient access to apps like Netflix or games like <em>Minecraft</em> via the Amazon Parent Dashboard. That&#39;s also where the child&#39;s guardian can set time limits for usage, filter out explicit songs and review activity for the Echo Dot. Of course, the bundle&#39;s recipient can also ask Alexa to play kid-friendly Audible books or interactive games from the Kids+ subscription service on their panda Echo Dot speaker.</p><p>The deal is a time-limited offer and only available for 19 more hours as of this writing. After that, the price for the bundle will likely go back to $95.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Earlier this year, Transport for London chose BAI Communications to build out a mobile network spanning all stations and tunnels, allowing commuters to check emails, watch videos and do everything else online on 4G or 5G even while they&#39;re inside metal tubes underground.&nbsp;</p><p>BAI has already started building the network at some of London&#39;s busiest stations, including Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road, Bank, Euston and Camden Town. They&#39;ll be the first to allow 4G and 5G connectivity by the end of 2022. City authorities expect the network to be completed and for the whole of London Underground to have mobile coverage by the end of 2024.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/three-ee-london-underground-114010662.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d98ddc6f-0660-40b5-8781-0514512972a5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 11:40:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640086813</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T11:40:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddf05bf0-4d1d-11ec-ba53-84a89fc52ceb" width="4900" height="3675" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ddf05bf0-4d1d-11ec-ba53-84a89fc52ceb" width="4900" height="3675" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Travelpix Ltd via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Commuters using the London Underground transport system.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Commuters using the London Underground]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla's holiday update adds TikTok and 'Sonic' to its infotainment system]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla&#39;s big holiday update for the year has started making its way to the automaker&#39;s fleet of electric vehicles, and it adds quite a large list of improvements and new features. For those addicted to scrolling on TikTok, perhaps the biggest addition is the TikTok app on Tesla Theater. According to the update notes posted by <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/12/20/tesla-releases-big-holiday-update-tiktok-app-ui-changes/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, they&#39;ll now be able to scroll the platform&#39;s short-form videos — on repeat, if they want — right on their vehicle&#39;s screen, so long as their car is parked.&nbsp;</p><p>In Toybox, owners will now also find the Light Show feature that Tesla <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-25-tesla-model-xmas-show.html">introduced</a> as an Easter Egg on the Model X back in 2015. For the Model X, a choreographed light show includes both flashing lights and opening falcon wing doors, but other models will have to make do with the former. Tesla has made its app launcher customizable, letting owners drag and drop their favorite apps onto the bottom menu bar. It&#39;s also simplifying navigation to make most the common primary controls, such as charging and windshield wipers, easier to access.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To automatically see a live camera view of their blind spot when they activate their turn signal, drivers can activate the new &quot;Automatic Blind Spot Camera&quot; option under Autopilot in Controls. Plus, drivers can now edit Waypoints to add stops or to initiate new navigation routes with updated arrival times. The holiday bundle has updates that fit the season, as well, including automatic seat heating that can regulate the front row seat temperatures based on the cabin environment, along with other cold weather improvements.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, drivers can now delete dashcam clips directly from the touchscreen and hide map details to remove distractions if they want. Finally, in the entertainment department, Tesla has added <em>Sonic the Hedgehog </em>and <em>Sudoku</em> to its Arcade — though we strongly suggest playing any Arcade game only while parked. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/tesla-video-game-driving.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that Tesla allowed drivers to play some games in moving cars, a concern that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is discussing with the company. The agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-touchscreen-video-games-driving-165327545.html">told Engadget</a> in a statement: &quot;Distraction-affected crashes are a concern, particularly in vehicles equipped with an array of convenience technologies such as entertainment screens. We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-holiday-update-tiktok-sonic-110149488.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca97fd9d-c8a1-4c49-b1a6-07f630eb7d41</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Dec 2021 11:01:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640078522</ingested><modified>2021-12-21T09:22:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/31da0a70-6233-11ec-b6dc-277bc0c7f625" width="1600" height="992" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/31da0a70-6233-11ec-b6dc-277bc0c7f625" width="1600" height="992" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile says it blocked 21 billion scam calls in 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/devices/t-mobile-releases-2021-scam-and-robocall-report">announced</a> that scam call traffic more than doubled in 2021 with attempts hitting an average of 425 million calls every week, <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-says-it-blocked-21-billion-scam-calls-this-year/"><em>Bleeping Computer</em></a> reported.

By 2026, the Environmental Protection Agency will require that automaker fleets travel an average of about 55 miles per gallon, up from the 37 miles per gallon standard they’re held to as of this year.</p><p>The agency estimates the policy will save American drivers between $210 billion and $420 billion through 2050 on fuel costs. Over the life of a model year 2026 vehicle, that will translate to about $1,080 in individual consumer savings after factoring in the higher initial cost of a more efficient vehicle. The EPA estimates the policy will also prevent the release of about 3.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide over the same time frame.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We followed the science, we listened to stakeholders, and we are setting robust and rigorous standards that will aggressively reduce the pollution that is harming people and our planet – and save families money at the same time,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said.</p><p>The new standards effectively mirror those put forward by the Obama administration in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/business/energy-environment/obama-unveils-tighter-fuel-efficiency-standards.html">2012</a>. Had former President Trump not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-03-trump-epa-dot-fuel-emissions-proposal.html">weakened those in 2018</a>, they would have required automakers to make vehicles that could travel about 51 miles per gallon by 2025.</p><p>Jeff Alson, a former EPA senior engineer, told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/20/climate/tailpipe-rules-climate-biden.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, the new standards recapture the emissions cuts carved out by the Trump administration. “That’s good, but it’s not going to get us anywhere near the level we’ve got to get to reduce vehicle emissions enough to protect the planet,” he said.</p><p>We&#39;ve reached out to Ford, General Motors, Honda, Toyota and Stellantis for comment on today&#39;s rulemaking.&nbsp;</p><p>The new standards mark the most significant climate action taken to date by President Biden. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions">As of 2019</a>, the transportation sector has been the single largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US. However, the announcement comes just one day after Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia said he <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/joe-manchin-kills-the-build-back-better-bill">would not support</a> the Democratic party’s Build Back Better plan.

The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-drops-warehouse-phone-ban-194434100.html">confirmed over the weekend</a> that it would allow employees to continue using phones.

Where once the two most powerful empires on the planet vied to be first to the moon, we now have corporations led by billionaire barons — Elon Musk’s SpaceX, Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin and Sir Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic — boasting a future filled with exo-planetary tourism. In 2021, the heads of these private companies finally made good on their myriad promises, successfully launching civilians, astronauts and, in two cases, themselves into the uppermost reaches of Earth’s atmosphere.</p><p>SpaceX continues to lead the burgeoning private spaceflight industry from the front. In January, the company successfully launched its first “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-satellite-launch-record-rideshare-program-152051045.html">rideshare mission</a>” aboard its Falcon 9 rocket, ferrying 133 microsatellites into orbit along with 10 of its own Starlink satellites. SpaceX’s Starlink ISP service, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starlink-satellite-internet-service-052743863.html">which now serves more than 10,000 customers</a>, has put <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-60-starlink-satellites-failed-landing-093333201.html">some 1,475 of the microsats</a> into orbit above the planet (with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-spacex-avoid-starlink-collisions-091502340.html">a total of 42,000 planned</a>, offering <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-global-coverage-084815155.html">global coverage by September</a>), despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/were-entombing-the-earth-in-an-impenetrable-shell-of-dead-satellites-163002560.html">the vehement protests of astronomers</a> who fear their presence will blind ground-based telescopes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>SpaceX’s endeavors to get its Starship prototype off the ground have not been nearly as successful as Starlink, mind you. The 100-passenger spacecraft, which was designed to help fulfill CEO Elon Musk’s dream of colonizing Mars and, presumably, titling himself  <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-tesla-technoking-game-of-thrones-master-of-coin-142248051.html">God Emperor of the Red Planet</a> (or some such), <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-high-altitude-test-flight-232643680.html">spectacularly exploded</a> on the launchpad following a high-altitude test flight in March.</p><div id="7d57befac5f945cd82f6b43dffe7be03"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">SN10 engine was low on thrust due (probably) to partial helium ingestion from fuel header tank.

SN15, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-sn15-223714843.html">which launched in May</a>, did however manage to land in one piece. The company is currently working on a plan <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-flight-plan-222943282.html">to launch a Starship prototype into orbit</a>, though no timetable is currently set for that launch — it was originally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-test-flight-155125322.html">slated for July</a> then pushed back to November, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/22/elon-musk-says-starship-should-be-ready-for-first-orbital-launch-next-month-pending-regulatory-approval/">depending on regulatory approval</a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-flight-january-144550856.html">is now set for January</a>.</p><p>But those failed tests have done little to slow SpaceX’s roll over its competition.

And in April, NASA gave the company a $2.9 billion contract <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">to ferry its Artemis lunar lander to the moon</a>.</p><p>Jeff Bezos and Blue Origin responded to the Artemis contract by first protesting the “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-blue-origin-225547469.html">fundamentally unfair</a>” decision with the US Government Accountability Office (GAO), which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lunar-lander-gao-223702744.html">delayed progress</a> on the project until July <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gao-denies-blue-origin-dynetics-protest-nasa-human-landing-system-181019362.html">when the GAO dismissed the claims</a>, even though <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-nasa-open-letter-181522642.html">Bezos offered NASA $2 billion</a> to grant them the contract instead.</p><p>&quot;We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA&#39;s decision, but the GAO wasn&#39;t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction,&quot; the company said following the GAO’s announcement.</p><p>Still seething from the GAO’s rebuke, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-federal-claims-court-nasa-challenge-163927526.html">Bezos then filed suit against NASA</a> in Federal Claims court, essentially trying to “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-on-blue-origin-lawsuit-151130133.html">sue [its] way to the moon</a>,” per Musk. Blue Origin claimed this was done &quot;in an attempt to remedy the flaws in the acquisition process found in NASA&#39;s Human Landing System,&quot; a spokesperson for Blue Origin told Engadget in August. &quot;We firmly believe that the issues identified in this procurement and its outcomes must be addressed to restore fairness, create competition, and ensure a safe return to the Moon for America.&quot; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-loses-nasa-lawsuit-over-spacex-151101253.html">Blue Origin eventually lost that lawsuit as well</a>.</p><p>And that’s when a prestige competition between the two richest men on Earth devolved into a middle school slap fight with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starlink-amazon-fcc-delay-195245682.html">SpaceX accusing Amazon</a> of intentionally delaying proposals for its Starlink service while Amazon countered with incriminations that Musk and SpaceX “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-elon-musk-rules-are-for-other-people-fcc-filing-084518762.html">don’t follow the rules</a>.”</p><p>“Whether it is launching satellites with unlicensed antennas, launching rockets without approval, building an unapproved launch tower, or re-opening a factory in violation of a shelter-in-place order, the conduct of SpaceX and other Musk-led companies makes their view plain: rules are for other people, and those who insist upon or even simply request compliance are deserving of derision and ad hominem attacks,” <a href="https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/ib/forms/reports/related_filing.hts?f_key=-471532&amp;f_number=SATAMD2021081800105">Amazon’s FCC filing reads</a>.</p><p>This year, not only did <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-successfully-launches-four-astronauts-102905066.html">SpaceX become the first private company to successfully transport astronauts to the ISS</a>, it also offered its first orbital flight for civilians with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-inspiration4-mission-full-crew-143428383.html">launch of the Inspiration4 mission in September</a>. A quartet of amatuer astronauts spent three days circling the Earth in a Dragon Capsule <a href="https://www.engadget.com/watch-spacex-inspiration4-splashdown-live-stream-214529012.html">before safely returning</a>. And while Musk has not yet left the planet’s atmosphere aboard a rocket of his company’s design, he has reportedly made a $10,000 down payment on a trip aboard <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-virgin-galactic-spaceflight-ticket-152514962.html">a future Virgin Galactic flight</a>.</p><p>One notch Bezos has on his belt that Musk does not is the fact that he has, in fact, flown aboard his own spacecraft. Following successful test flights of Blue Origin’s upgraded New Shepard in both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-upgraded-new-shepard-first-flight-121059379.html">January</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-new-shepard-ns-15-test-flight-060356586.html">April</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html">Jeff Bezos and his brother</a> — along with 18-year old Oliver Daemen (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-new-shepherd-seat-auction-winner-182036391.html">whose parents spent $28 million for the honor</a>) and 84-year-old Wally Funk — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html">successfully traversed the Karman line on July 20th</a>. Blue Origin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-shatner-flight-delay-171339388.html">followed up that feat in October</a> when it shuttled William Shatner, of Star Trek fame, into space. During that flight, Shatner, who is 90, unseated 84-year-old Funk as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/william-shatner-blue-origin-spaceflight-successful-145444763.html">the oldest person to go to space</a>.

The company also announced at the end of October that it hopes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/orbital-reef-200848765.html">to build and deploy a commercial space station</a> called the Orbital Reef — think, the ISS but with more intrusive advertising — by the second half of this decade. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-backs-blue-origins-orbital-reef-space-station-220247282.html">NASA has since awarded the project</a> a Space Act Agreement, along with funding through the design phase, as part of its Commercial LEO Development program.</p><p>Virgin Galactic, on the other hand, started its 2021 off in a holding pattern.

A subsequent redo test scheduled for February <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-delays-rocket-test-flight-153259287.html">was also delayed</a> to May after the company opted to make additional “technical checks.”</p><p>While these aren’t major setbacks in the same vein as say an exploding StarShip, VG’s continued delays have pushed back the company’s goal of commercial space tourism flights <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-delays-space-tourism-flights-2022-140906661.html">to at least 2022</a>.

On July 11th, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html">Branson and his crew did just that</a> — well, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/can-richard-branson-really-call-himself-an-astronaut-after-sundays-virgin-galactic-flight-170015596.html">technically</a>.</p><p>Buoyed by the success of their boss’ flight, Virgin Galactic began offering tickets to would-be space tourists for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-reopens-ticket-sales-073418808.html">the low, low discount price of $450,000</a>. As of the start of November, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-100-tickets-450000-space-flight-175402247.html">more than 100 tickets have been sold</a>.</p><p>Branson’s flight was not flawless, however, and that raised the ire of the FAA. During SpaceShip II’s landing, the spacecraft “deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America,” <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-bars-virgin-galactic-spaceflights-203534520.html">per the FAA</a>. In a subsequent statement from the company, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/faa-probe-anomaly-richard-branson-virgin-galactic-092123771.html">Virgin disagreed with the FAA’s characterization</a>.</p><p>“When the vehicle encountered high altitude winds which changed the trajectory, the pilots and systems monitored the trajectory to ensure it remained within mission parameters,” the company argued. “Our pilots responded appropriately to these changing flight conditions exactly as they were trained and in strict accordance with our established procedures. Although the flight’s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico. At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory.” A brief investigation by the FAA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-cleared-to-fly-again-following-faa-investigation-071032837.html">eventually cleared the company to resume test flights</a>.</p><p>Despite these advances in private spaceflight systems, don’t expect the space tourism industry to take off before at least the start of the next decade. If Virgin Galactic’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-100-tickets-450000-space-flight-175402247.html">recent price hike from $250,000 to $450,000 per ticket</a> is any indication, very few people will be able to afford such a trip for the foreseeable future. So while two of the world’s richest men may have had the honor of temporarily escaping our gravity well, don’t think you’ll get your chance anytime soon — unless <a href="https://www.engadget.com/omaze-sweepstakes-win-two-seats-on-virgin-galactic-flight-to-space-140032746.html">you can win it like a Golden Ticket</a> like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-announces-omaze-sweepstakes-winner-190504449.html">Keisha S did</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/in-2021-billionaires-headed-to-the-stars-210013764.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8e8c4bd6-7291-4d71-9db2-3fb3e471e34e</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 15:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640002803</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T12:20:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fd148360-5f5d-11ec-af7f-206a47ded9ec" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fd148360-5f5d-11ec-af7f-206a47ded9ec" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Virgin Galactic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Richard Branson in space #Unity22]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Richard Branson in space #Unity22]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[What we bought: Our favorite gadgets of 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While plenty of gadgets cross our desks, we at Engadget also end up buying a lot of things for ourselves throughout the year. In 2021, some of us invested in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">smart home devices</a> and others (re)discovered passions for things like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/libby-app-irl-123053789.html">e-books</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/u-turn-audio-orbit-plus-kanto-yu4-irl-150023872.html">vinyl</a>, but there are plenty of things we bought and loved that didn’t make it onto the site. Here, our staffers look back on the year that was by gushing about their favorite items they bought this year.</p><h2>Dyson V11 Torque vacuum cleaner</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d336c5f0-5d03-11ec-9fbf-4f1ba03a4761" alt="Someone stands while using the Dyson V11 Torque stick vacuum cleaner in their brightly lit living room." data-uuid="91b63469-bb99-3d7e-a389-8e1f0f17ed43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dyson</div></figure><p>After a few years of waffling, I finally pulled the trigger in 2021 and bought a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Dyson stick vacuum" href="https://fave.co/3Afo1Z9">Dyson stick vacuum</a>. You could say I fell for the hype, but honestly it’s been one of my favorite purchases of the year and arguably the most useful. Until now, we had been relying on a few-years-old Roomba (lovingly named Dale) to clean our two-bedroom apartment — Dale did a good job, but the Dyson is even better. Sure, we have to actually vacuum ourselves, but both my fiancé and I find the task soothing (while our cat finds it absolutely horrific).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The hype is real when it comes to the power of Dyson stick vacuums. The V11 Torque sucks up nearly anything and everything in its path, including the masses of cat hair hiding in our carpet. I like how the machine automatically adjusts the suction power when it moves from carpet to hard flooring, and its three modes let you control how powerful it is to begin with. The LCD screen also shows how long the battery will last in each mode, and it’s good enough that I’ve never had to stop cleaning in order to power up. Maybe that will change if and when we move into a larger home, but even then, it’ll be a small price to pay for tidy goodness. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:My vacuum" href="https://qvc.uikc.net/do5AQ7">My vacuum</a> also came with a bunch of attachments, so the machine transforms from a full-sized vac to a handheld with just a few snaps. That lets me clean around my couch and the couch itself — a joy that 29-year-old me might not have appreciated, but one that 30-year-old me relishes in. —<em> Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><h2>Sonos Roam</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/e4a2ba60-9eae-11eb-9d7f-ffaefec668fa" alt="Sonos Roam portable speaker outside, standing vertically on a wooden railing." data-uuid="6212097b-c57d-3a99-bee0-8813851e0eb4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>I bought the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Sonos Roam" href="https://fave.co/3uZmWUl">Sonos Roam</a> with one primary purpose in mind. In Canada, the early stage of the vaccine rollout was delayed compared to how it played out in the US. As a result, most restaurants and bars either weren’t open or operating at full capacity in the late spring and early summer. And so, for the second year in a row, it looked like any hangouts I would have with my friends would be outside. I figured the Sonos Roam would make those more fun, and I was right.</p><p>Everytime I brought it with me to a park hang, my friends would remark how great it sounded. And that’s the best compliment you can give the Roam. It’s small and compact, making it easy to bring with you on any adventure, but more than anything, it sounds way better than any Bluetooth speaker of its size has the right to sound. Because of that, I ended up using the Roam a lot more than I thought I would. It was my constant companion through the summer and fall months, providing a soundtrack when I had to cook dinner, clean my bike or host friends for a patio party. If music is how we decorate time, the Roam did an incredible job of it. <em>– Igor Bonifacic, Associate Editor</em></p><h2>Toro UltraPlus leaf blower and vacuum</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4e8c8a70-59ec-11ec-bf2d-8049d6e2bcfa" alt="Toro UltraPlus leaf blower" data-uuid="8cf91381-05e5-38bb-b677-49daf28e75df"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Toro</div></figure><p>As I&#39;ve acclimated to the grind of yard work, a part of me feels like I&#39;m transforming into <em>King of the Hill&#39;s</em> propane-selling, tool-loving Hank Hill. That realization struck me pretty hard this fall, as I prepared to brave another onslaught of leaves from the enormous trees around my house. Last year, it typically took me around two hours to rake and bag everything from my tiny front yard. I just couldn&#39;t go through that again. So I decided to buy a leaf mulching vacuum – and it was the best decision I&#39;ve made all year.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Toro UltraPlus" href="https://amzn.to/3DEs7vo">Toro UltraPlus</a> (model 51621) looks like a typical leaf blower, but it does so much more, <em>I tell you what</em>. Its vacuum attachment can suck up an enormous pile of leaves in minutes, and its metal impeller grinds it all up into a fine pulp. Best of all, once its mulching bag is full, I can just unzip it to dump out the contents into a yard waste bag, or directly over a portion of my garden. Thanks to the Toro, I was able to clean my entire front yard in under 30 minutes. Getting that free time back was easily worth $100.</p><p>Like most consumer-grade yard gadgets, the Toro UltraPlus has its share of downsides. Its leaf blowing is hilariously weak – at full blast, it sometimes had trouble moving just a handful of leaves. That&#39;s okay with me, since I also hate the relentless drone of leaf blowers in the suburbs. (And yes, its mulching feature is pretty loud as well, but at least that works quickly.)</p><p>My biggest worry about the UltraPlus is that it&#39;s almost entirely made of plastic. It feels like it’s only a matter of time until the tab that holds in the vacuum tube breaks off. As a plug-in tool, it&#39;s also annoying to juggle a long extension cord while I&#39;m trying to beautify my yard. I can live with that inconvenience, though, as cordless leaf vacuums typically cost over $400.</p><p>Given how much the Toro UltraPlus has changed fall cleanup for me, I’ll probably just buy another if my curent one breaks. And who knows, maybe it’ll last long enough for my daughter to start helping out with yard work.

It was always the same routine: I would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-24-apple-watch-series-5-review.html">wear the thing for weeks</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-16-the-best-gps-running-watches-for-2019.html">take it on runs</a> and become obsessed with closing my rings. And then, I’d send my loaner unit back to Apple, and return to life as someone who wore an ugly, not-very-smart watch, or sometimes no watch at all.</p><p>2021 was the first time I felt compelled to buy one for myself. I wish I could say there was something particularly compelling about the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Series 7" href="https://amzn.to/3DtdTgQ">Series 7</a>. But it’s actually a lot like the Series 6, and I knew that when I bought it. No, I got an Apple Watch mostly because I was fed up with my trusty Garmin. It was never pretty – utilitarian at best – but it became decidedly less so when I broke the strap. Yep, I paid $399 for the Apple Watch because I wanted something stylish that would count my steps.</p><p>I’m mostly happy with it. The beige (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:&#x00201c;Starlight&#x00201d;" href="https://amzn.to/3DtdTgQ">“Starlight”</a>) color scheme goes with everything. I love unlocking my MacBook with the watch instead of being forced to type a long password on Apple’s unreliable Butterfly keyboard. And the automatic workout detection is as precise as I remember it, gently tapping me on the wrist a few minutes into each of my daily walks.</p><p>The biggest issue is my nightly routine of fighting with the watch over how many hours I spent standing throughout the day. The sensor is mercurial and erratic, ignoring the time I spent literally standing at the stove, or even a long series of squats, but sometimes rewarding me for sitting on my butt. Whatever, Apple: I know how long it took me to make that squash for Thanksgiving – and I have photos of the burn marks to prove it. <em>— Dana Wollman, Editor in Chief</em></p><h2>Durablow gas fireplace smart remote control</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/91181ac0-59ed-11ec-b71c-12adb0f0592c" alt="Durablow gas fireplace smart remote control" data-uuid="1c876ba0-e9a5-319c-be30-4fe1c863a487"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Durablow</div></figure><p>I live in a quintessential drafty San Francisco apartment. We have central heat, but my partner and I both have allergies and our furnace seems to do a better job at distributing dust around the house than keeping it warm. Which means in the winter months (and, often in the spring and summer too, because San Francisco) we use our gas fireplace to help keep things cozy. We use it so much that we started wishing we could control it from any room in the house. We have smart lights and other devices connected to our Google Home speakers, so why not the fireplace?</p><p>That’s where <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Durablow&#x002019;s WiFi-enabled fireplace remote" href="https://amzn.to/3pwopPy">Durablow’s WiFi-enabled fireplace remote</a> comes in. For about $70, the gadget turns any gas fireplace into a smart fireplace. (We use Google Assistant, but it’s also compatible with Alexa and other smart home systems.) The setup itself was fairly painless: it required connecting one set of wires to the gas valve, and downloading an app to pair the receiver with a Google account. Once it’s paired, you can control the fireplace with voice commands from your smart speaker.</p><p>That may sound like a needless amount of effort for something we can also control from a switch on the wall, but after another year spent (mostly) at home, I can safely say rigging Durablow remote control was life changing. Having it connected to our Google Home system means we can turn the fireplace on from any room, which is especially nice in the early mornings when the living room would otherwise be freezing. We can even activate from the Google Home app on our phones when we’re on our way home on a chilly night, brr. <em>– Karissa Bell, Senior Editor</em></p><h2>Bombas Performance Running Quarter socks</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/aedb1080-5d03-11ec-bfbb-92c873760cbc" alt="Bombas Performance Quarter Running Socks" data-uuid="85439305-11ba-37ea-82a4-d4054f609a74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bombas</div></figure><p>I’ve always had really bad luck with socks, and that might be because I typically bought the cheapest ones I could find. I regularly fought to keep ankle socks from falling down and, after particularly long days in not the best shoes, the backs of my heels would be screaming with cuts and blisters. And I detest nothing more than feeling my sock slip down into the depths of my sneakers in the middle of a run.</p><p>Ultimately, I caved and decided to give <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Bombas&#x002019; running socks" href="https://fave.co/3G2Jp74">Bombas’ running socks</a> a try, and I went with the quarter length because they seemed to be the best option for all kinds of runs. Well, you get what you pay for, folks. These are, without a doubt, the best running socks I’ve ever had — they don’t move around, they don’t slip and they keep my toes fairly warm even during late-November morning runs. They’ve become one of those staples in my wardrobe that are so good precisely because I barely notice them, which is in stark contrast to the cheap socks that always demanded more of my attention than I wanted to give. —<em> V.P.</em></p><h2>Astrohaus Freewrite</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" alt="The Freewrite standalone word processor with keyboard sits on an office desktop." data-uuid="5b5e47ab-6e73-3ff6-8d92-29d9a5292fe7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>My first impression of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Freewrite smart typewriter" href="https://bit.ly/3It2Nfq">Freewrite smart typewriter</a> from Astrohaus was one of confusion. I had the feeling that I was looking at a $600 solution searching for a problem. For as much as a modest Windows laptop, the Freewrite combines a small E Ink display with a mechanical keyboard and the ability to sync whatever you write to the cloud. It’s a very simple product that sets out to do one thing well: offer an excellent, distraction-free environment for drafting text. As such, there are no bells and whistles here — it’s minimalism taken to the extreme.</p><p>Under almost any circumstance, this product would make no sense. But, during the pandemic, I got an itch to try my hand at some different writing — fiction, essays, just something different from what I do for work. That’s when the Freewrite started calling me. Despite the high price tag, I became enamored with its beautiful design and imagined using it to bang out words without being distracted by Twitter, the vast expanses of the internet or my colleagues on Slack.</p><p>As expected, no piece of hardware is enough to turn anyone into a novelist. But the Freewrite is a delightful product because of its simplicity. In the era of multi-use gadgets, it’s rare to come across something that focuses on doing one thing exceedingly well. But that’s what the Freewrite does. Its keyboard is a joy to use and the E Ink screen is a smart choice for a device like this. Coming from a laptop it takes a few minutes to get used to the refresh rate, but the basic black-and-white is perfectly suited for text. The Freewrite isn’t for everyone — but if you make a living writing (or are just passionate about it as a hobby), it’s a device worth considering. <em>– Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Managing Editor</em></p><h2>Nintendo Switch OLED edition</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d84c0a70-261a-11ec-96f7-64f681b232c1" alt="Samus Aran in a save point" data-uuid="8a9e92ef-6479-3f13-b836-41eff1ff99e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Sure, it’s not the Pro model I hoped for, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:OLED Switch" href="https://amzn.to/3E70qvF">OLED Switch</a> offers the definitive Nintendo experience (for now). This is doubly true if you spend most of your Switch time in handheld mode.</p><p>With a bigger seven-inch, higher-contrast OLED display, all of my games look better on the new Switch, without exception. And I get to play it for longer without charging, despite the same specifications and even battery size. The longer battery life appears to be due to the virtue of a less power-hungry OLED screen, and coming from the original launch model, where I was lucky to eke out 4 hours on games like<em> Super Mario Odyssey </em>or<em> Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, it’s a genuine improvement for me, as I love to used to travel with my Switch everywhere. I love the white Joy-Cons, but I’m afraid to wear them out or get them dirty. But that’s my problem.</p><p>Most have said it’s a nice, if inessential, upgrade for existing Switch owners – but if you typically play untethered from a TV, the OLED model is, for me, a substantially better console. Contingent on Omicron’s movements, my OLED Switch will soon have its first test – a long-haul flight to Las Vegas. <em>– Mat Smith, UK Bureau Chief</em></p><h2>PopSocket MagSafe grip with Smartish phone case</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ec88ce80-59ee-11ec-afe9-0d51f41b5dd9" alt="PopSocket MagSafe Grip" data-uuid="1e24c47a-d0a8-3281-ba39-c94747b8c76d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">PopSocket</div></figure><p>For many years now, I’ve been a big fan of PopSockets, those round plastic extendable discs you stick on the back of your phone. I didn’t really <em>want</em> to like them – I do admit they’re pretty bulky – but they’re surprisingly useful. They make it a lot easier to hold a slim and slippery phone one-handed, plus they do a decent job propping up your phone, too. There’s one major downside though: Reusing them – taking them off and putting them on again – was not something you wanted to do very often, as the gel adhesive gets less sticky over time.</p><p>But this year I got myself the new iPhone 13, which supports MagSafe. Now, instead of a normal PopSocket, I could use the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:PopGrip for MagSafe" href="https://amzn.to/3Gzo1a1">PopGrip for MagSafe</a>, which simply attaches magnetically onto the phone. Reusing it is as simple as pulling it off and putting it on again, no need for a sticky adhesive. I still wanted a case for my phone to protect it against the occasional fall, so I made sure to get a MagSafe-compatible one. I ended up choosing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:this floral Smartish case" href="https://amzn.to/3oBDbVZ">this floral Smartish case</a> because I liked the look of it. And yes, the PopGrip works fine with it on.</p><p>I know it sounds silly, but I just absolutely love this combination of the Smartish case and the PopGrip MagSafe. The case has a nice texture that makes it feel more secure, and I just love that I can put on and take off the grip as many times as I want without worrying about destroying any adhesive. And I do this more often than you’d think – I usually take it off to power up the phone on my wireless charger, and pop it back on for the rest of the day. I like to joke that this accessory is my number one reason for getting a new iPhone – and not, you know, all the other good things about the phone itself – but honestly, it’s probably not far from the truth. <em>– Nicole Lee, Senior Editor</em></p><h2>Wahoo Kickr Smart Bike Trainer and Zwift</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c8a41a60-5cfa-11ec-b7e7-c24283399beb" alt="An in-home setup for Wahoo Kickr Smart and Zwift showing a bike and TV." data-uuid="1ffb370a-8c89-3b22-9ef3-b12553f0480c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>I spent the summer of 2020 cycling around my Brooklyn neighborhood most days to keep in shape. But with a long winter looming and growing tired of the chaos in the streets, I decided to pony-up some cash for a home fitness solution. After much deliberation, I settled on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Wahoo Kickr Smart" href="https://fave.co/3oGcI9O">Wahoo Kickr Smart</a> bike trainer. It’s one of the pricier models at $1,200, but its folding legs, subtle tilt range, low noise output and top specs seemed future-proof. Paired with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Zwift" href="https://fave.co/3ydg8Us">Zwift</a>, a massively multiplayer online cycling and running app ($16/month), I now had the biking sim I’d always wanted and an exercise setup that’s season agnostic.</p><p>The Kickr Smart is relatively compact with a handle and folding legs for stowing away during downtime. It’s direct-drive for use <em>with</em> your bike instead of being a space-hogging standalone device. You remove your back wheel, lock into place and use the unit&#39;s own (upgradable) gear cassette so you’ll be able to shift gears normally. This allows for quick release, so you can still ride your bike outdoors on a whim, although my road bike has been in position for a while now.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/196910c0-5cfd-11ec-8ffd-fe53e6c440c3" alt="A screenshot from the cycling sim Zwift showing the Neokyo city environment." data-uuid="7fecfadd-d0b3-36cb-acdb-c8a085d54f88"><figcaption>An in-game POV screenshot from Zwift&#39;s Makuri Islands: Neokyo expansion.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jon Turi / Engadget</div></figure><p>I run Zwift on an Apple TV, which connects to the Kickr Smart via Bluetooth and includes power, cadence and speed tracking. I set up in front of a flatscreen for full POV immersion in one of the various virtual worlds offered, including the new <a href="https://www.zwift.com/neokyo">Neokyo cityscape</a>.

To start with, the Standard Range model, with a projected 230 miles of range, will come with a 98 kWh battery pack. Meanwhile, the optional Extended Range version (300 miles targeted) will have a massive 131 kWh battery.&nbsp;</p><p>The Standard Range package will be the main offering on the first three of four versions: the fleet-oriented Lightning Pro, the XLT and the Lariat. The Extended Range is optional for the XLT and Lariat, and standard on the top-end Platinum model. Ford said that the &quot;F-150 Lighting Pro model will be available with the standard-range battery to retail customers,&quot; but it <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/05/24/all-electric-f-150-lightning-pro.html">previously said</a> that it would be available with the Extended Range option for fleet buyers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ford also revealed that the power fold mirrors would only be available on the Lariat and Platinum models, and that the Tough Bed spray-in bed liner is not standard, but an available option on all trims. Other options we already knew about include a high-powered 9.6 kW Pro Power system for the first two trims (it&#39;s standard on Lariat and Platinum) and 15.5-inch touchscreen with Sync 4A, available on the upper trim levels.</p><p>Ford has yet to reveal exact retail prices, but it previously said that the Standard Range Lightning Pro will start at $39,974 before any tax incentives for commercial buyers, while the Extended Range model (again only for fleet buyers) will start at $49,974. Retail prices are expected to start at $42,000 and top out at $90,000 for the Platinum model. That&#39;s a fair bit higher than the $28,000 base price for an F-150 ICE version, but then again, most folks pay <a href="https://www.kbb.com/reviews/pricing-your-next-ford-f-150-it-could-cost-60000-or-more/">considerably more than that</a> on average.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the large battery sizes, Ford&#39;s prices actually seem surprisingly reasonable. By comparison, Hyundai&#39;s <a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/vehicles/kona-electric">Kona Electric</a> has a much smaller 64 kWh battery and starts at $34,000. We should know the exact F-150 Lightning prices soon, as Ford said in the livestream that order banks would open in January 2022. Currently, it has 200,000 pre-orders in hand, and recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-stops-f-150-lightning-reservations-at-200000-192434385.html">cut off</a> further reservations.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-ev-pickup-98-kwh-131-kwh-batteries-092329022.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1cc737b-5811-466d-b529-42da19288e19</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 09:23:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639992736</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T09:32:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b6f75c0-616f-11ec-8b7e-aba0cee9ea46" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b6f75c0-616f-11ec-8b7e-aba0cee9ea46" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ford's F-150 Lightning will come with 98 kWh and 131 kWh battery packs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ford's F-150 Lightning will come with 98 kWh and 131 kWh battery packs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Malaysia's updated copyright law imprisons streaming pirates for up to 20 years]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Illegal streaming could be particularly costly in Malaysia. <em>TorrentFreak</em><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/malaysia-passes-bill-to-imprison-illegal-streaming-pirates-for-up-to-20-years-211218/">reports</a> the country has passed <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Parlimen-CopyrightAct1987-ammendment-dec21-01.pdf">amendments</a> to its Copyright Act that punish those who enable pirate streaming.

The two have <a href="https://twitter.com/youtubetv/status/1472657141789904899?s=21">struck</a> a deal that restores access to ESPN, FX and other Disney channels on YouTube&#39;s streaming service. Local ABC stations will come back over the course of the day (December 19th), but you may already see access to any recordings of Disney-owned channels.</p><p>The base subscription rate is returning to $65 per month, but YouTube TV promised that &quot;all impacted members&quot; would still receive a one-off $15 discount.

As is often the case with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-returns-to-dishs-lineup-after-protracted-dispute-is-resolved-061504019.html">disputes like this</a>, each side blamed the other. Disney claimed YouTube TV &quot;declined to reach a fair deal,&quot; while YouTube maintained that it was advocating on &quot;behalf&quot; of viewers.</p><p>This isn&#39;t YouTube TV&#39;s only row over carriage deals. The service has traded blows with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-tv-nbc-universal-dispute-resolved-200510827.html">NBCUniversal</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-05-youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-yes-network.html">Sinclair</a>, for instance. With that said, the Disney fight may have been one of its most important. It&#39;s not just that channels like ESPN remain a major draw for live TV services — it&#39;s that Disney could easily have siphoned some of those customers to its equivalent Hulu offering. YouTube may have decided that any increased costs (and possible rate hikes) were less painful than losing viewership.</p><div id="4f9cc4bef1df4c4782032a1364a55c90"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re happy to announce that we&#39;ve reached a deal with Disney and have already started to restore access to channels like ESPN and FX, and Disney recordings that were previously in your Library.

The principal investigator for NASA&#39;s Juno mission, Scott Bolton, has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html">produced</a> an audio recording of magnetic field activity around <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html">Jupiter&#39;s moon Ganymede</a> as the Juno spacecraft flew past on June 7th, 2021. The 50-second clip reveals a sharp change in activity as the probe entered a different part of Ganymede&#39;s magnetosphere, possibly as it left the night side to enter the daylight.</p><p>The audio came from shifting electric and magnetic frequencies into the audible range. Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere dominates that of its moons and is present in the recording, but Ganymede is the only moon in the Solar System to have a magnetic field (likely due to its liquid iron core). This isn&#39;t a feat you could replicate elsewhere in the near future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The soundtrack was part of a larger Juno briefing where the mission team revealed the most detailed map yet of Jupiter&#39;s magnetic field. The data showed how long it would take the Great Red Spot and the equatorial Great Blue Spot to move around the planet (roughly 4.5 years and 350 years respectively). The findings also showed that east-west jetstreams are ripping the Great Blue Spot apart, and that polar cyclones behave much like ocean vortices on Earth.</p><p>You wouldn&#39;t hear these sounds if you could visit Ganymede yourself. However, they&#39;re a reminder that even seemingly dead worlds are frequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-03-nasa-mars-quake-sounds.html">brimming with activity</a> you can detect using the right instruments.
