The Korean giant has today <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-brings-advanced-ultra-fine-pixel-technologies-to-new-mobile-image-sensors">announced</a> the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-isocell-2-phone-camera-sensor-162055301.html">ISOCELL</a> HP1, which it says is the first 200-megapixel image sensor (with 0.64μm pixels) for mobile devices. It added that the silicon is already small enough to fit in mobile hardware and that the promise of all of those extra pixels is to retain fidelity when pictures are cropped or resized.</p><p>Of course, these eye-catching figures don’t really mean a huge amount given that the HP1 will use pixel-binning just like every other overpowered image sensor. But arguably, the biggest innovation here is ChameleonCell, which can adjust the extent of the binning depending on the environment. For instance, in very low light, the camera bins down (by 16) to a 12.5-megapixel sensor, but promises images that are far brighter and clearer compared to its rivals.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/05e37340-0bd3-11ec-952b-2894d478dfd9" style="height:1009;width:1000;" alt="Samsung" data-uuid="20ddc215-03d9-3e39-99af-93743165390d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>When shooting video in clear light, meanwhile, the system will divide by four, offering a 50-megapixel lens capable of shooting 8K videos at 30 frames per second.

In a piece discussing not just that particular flight but the company&#39;s various <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-10-31-virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo.html">safety</a> issues throughout the years, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight"><em>The New Yorker</em></a> explained that Virgin&#39;s spacecraft went off-course during descent, triggering an &quot;entry glide-cone warning.&quot; The spacecraft uses the glide cone method, which mimics water circling down the drain, for landing. Apparently, the pilots for the mission didn&#39;t fly as steeply as they should have, causing the system to raise the alarm.&nbsp;</p><p>An FAA spokesperson confirmed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-faa-probing-virgin-galactic-july-11-flight-deviation-2021-09-01/"><em>Reuters</em></a> that the vehicle &quot;deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America&quot; and it&#39;s investigating the incident. The agency gives missions to space a designated airspace they can fly in to prevent collisions with commercial planes and to minimize civilian casualties in the event of an accident. Virgin&#39;s Unity 22 mission flew out of that designated airspace for a minute and forty-one seconds before the pilots were able to correct course.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nicholas Schmidle, author of <em>The New Yorker</em> piece, said he attended a meeting a few years ago, wherein the same pilots on the Unity 22 flight said a red light entry glide-cone warning should &quot;scare the shit out of you.&quot; Apparently, that means it&#39;s too late, and that the safest course of action is to abort. In a statement it <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2021/09/01/virgin-galactic-statement-about-anomaly-on-richard-bransons-suborbital-space-flight/">published</a> after the article went out, though, Virgin Galactic said it &quot;disputes the misleading characterizations and conclusions&quot; in the piece and that the people on the flight weren&#39;t in any danger as a result of the flight deviation. The company said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;When the vehicle encountered high altitude winds which changed the trajectory, the pilots and systems monitored the trajectory to ensure it remained within mission parameters. Our pilots responded appropriately to these changing flight conditions exactly as they were trained and in strict accordance with our established procedures. Although the flights ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico. At no time were passengers and crew put in any danger as a result of this change in trajectory.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>It also said that the spacecraft did not fly outside of the lateral confines of the mission&#39;s protected airspace,  though it did drop below the altitude of the airspace it was provided. The company added that it&#39;s &quot;working in partnership with the FAA to address the airspace for future flights.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/faa-probe-anomaly-richard-branson-virgin-galactic-092123771.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ac480b9-2033-4efa-9d98-7775653d1f9b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 09:21:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630574512</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T09:22:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/152be540-e288-11eb-bff3-9365edfa02ac" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/152be540-e288-11eb-bff3-9365edfa02ac" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW MEXICO, USA - JULY 11: Sir Richard Branson flew into space aboard a Virgin Galactic vessel, a voyage he described as the "experience of a lifetime" at the Spaceport America in New Mexico, United States on July 11, 2021.

It’s packed full of references across the franchise, including Beckett Mariner, Sam Rutherford and Brad Boimler engaging in a not-so-friendly match of <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Anbo-jyutsu"><ins>anbo-jyutsu</ins></a>, the appearance of <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Last_Outpost_(episode)"><ins>not-so-enlightened Ferengi</ins></a> and even the episode name, which references how no one can seem to agree on how to pronounce the creature whose name is spelled “<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Mugato"><ins>mugato</ins></a>.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/45966bc0-0b5e-11ec-af9f-1cf89e0334ec" style="height:1079;width:1917;" alt="LCARS graphics" data-uuid="b5e9185b-5504-3351-b891-f9b8ede8d43a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>However, after a season and a half, the show has already <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-premiere-strange-energies-070032163.html"><ins>settled into a groove</ins></a>, and as a streaming program there’s no reason why “Mugato, Gumato” would be anyone’s first episode. Paramount+ would only pull up this one if last week’s “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-tom-paris-voyager-070055176.html"><ins>We’ll Always Have Tom Paris</ins></a>” had recently been watched. With less need to be accessible, that leaves a show like <em>Lower Decks</em> free to dabble in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-two-kayshon-his-eyes-open-070038927.html"><ins>continuity and in-jokes for the long-time fans</ins></a>.</p><p>Fan service is often derided for being gratuitous at best, and an act of gatekeeping at worst. After nearly 55 years and over 800 episodes aired, Star Trek has a lot of baggage that can be intimidating to a newcomer. The Abrams reboot in 2009 tried to wipe the slate clean but was still bogged down by decades of cultural knowledge, with even Trek casuals expecting to hear phrases like “beam me up” and “I’m a doctor!” It found itself trying to appease multiple groups of fans and ultimately thrilling few.</p><div id="cbb36f94c766455fafd9e595f692f8fe"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vlWcGOQXspY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>And yet, despite its deep dives into Star Trek lore, <em>Lower Decks</em> can still be a great entryway for new fans in how it chooses to subvert so many long-time franchise tropes. Both newcomers and hardcore Trekkies get to be on the same page when it comes to the all-important question: What comes next?</p><p>In that vein, “Mugato, Gumato” is a fun ride. The main plot revolves around the re-discovery of a rare species only previously seen in a rather forgettable <em>TOS</em> episode, with the <em>USS Cerritos</em> charged with finding out how the animals got so far from their home planet. It’s not the most thrilling adventure on the surface, which makes it a perfect assignment for the crew of the lower-tier ship. Boimler and Rutherford are assigned to the away team, which would normally <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Redshirt"><ins>spell doom</ins></a> for a pair of chronically unlucky ensigns.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/412834d0-0b61-11ec-b73e-8a18c28b677e" style="height:1068;width:1914;" alt="Bradward Boimler" data-uuid="50eb7613-5c7d-3f3c-a39e-b618107c2119"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>Instead, the rest of the group is captured by a group of Ferengi poachers, leaving Brad and Sam in the unlikely and awkward position of saviors. But rather than have them step into the role of “action-oriented leading men,” they instead embrace their unique skills as “nerdy supporting characters.” Meanwhile, it’s the captain and bridge crew who get stuck with the b-plot of helping out a stranded trader whose ship they accidentally destroyed.</p><p>After Boimler and Rutherford save the day with a well-thought-out PowerPoint (yes, really) it ends up being the senior staff who isn’t fully informed of what happened on the planet. This is in direct contrast to a <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Veritas_(episode)"><ins>previous episode</ins></a> where Boimler has pointed out that it’s not their place to know what’s going on. Captain Freeman just shrugs the whole incident off as some “environmentally conscious Ferengi,” apparently unaware of the two ensigns’ key role in getting the ultra-capitalist Ferengi to change their ways in favor of a more profitable path without resorting to violence.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8f1dbee0-0b60-11ec-af9e-cc5caa37cd22" style="height:1061;width:1910;" alt="Rutherford and Boimler pointing a... thing" data-uuid="a73ab703-21ad-3b2d-b2e6-57d34df160b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>It also ends up being good for continuity, in how it reconciles the two versions of Ferengi we’ve seen throughout the franchise. Here, it argues, they really are the same species in the end, just that the offensive, retrograde Ferengi from “The Last Outpost” hadn’t found a less overtly evil way to make money.</p><p>“Mugato, Gumato” may have trafficked in old tropes, but it also twisted them in a way to teach the characters and audience something new about themselves and the franchise. Or, as Boimler and Rutherford would say, “If we’re both unhappy, it means we’ve reached… a compromise!”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-four-070120756.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3da716f5-d782-46ea-ba1a-4d86ca572760</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Sep 2021 07:01:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630528436</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T20:34:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a6c399a0-0b62-11ec-afff-b8ed7e036156" width="1920" height="1079" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a6c399a0-0b62-11ec-afff-b8ed7e036156" width="1920" height="1079" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rutherford and Boimler playing "Diplomath"]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Star Trek: Lower Decks]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will allow some media apps to link outside the App Store for payments]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has been taking a lot of flak lately over the 30 percent cut it takes from app developers. Starting next year, though, certain developers will be able to avoid paying the tech giant a commission. The company has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/">announced</a> that it will update the App Store in early 2022 to allow developers of &quot;reader&quot; apps to add in-app links to their websites, allowing users to set up their accounts and make payments. Apple defines reader apps as those that &quot;provide previously purchased content or content subscriptions for digital magazines, newspapers, books, audio, music and video.&quot; As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-02/apple-to-let-app-makers-point-users-to-web-to-pay-for-services"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> notes, that means the new rule would apply to services like Netflix and Spotify.</p><div id="6b74345b79914f08811e9ce6898d2aab"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is what you get when trying to sign up for Netflix on the iPhone today.

Spotify <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-13-spotify-apple-complaint-eu-app-store.html">filed a complaint</a> against Apple with the European Commission in 2019 over what it says are anti-competitive practices by the tech giant. Unwilling to pay a 30 percent commission, it pulled users&#39; ability to pay for premium upgrades from the iOS app. Netflix also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-emails-show-how-it-tried-to-stop-netflix-from-dropping-in-app-purchases-082653224.html">removed</a> users&#39; ability to pay for a subscription within its iOS app in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the upcoming update doesn&#39;t cover games, it won&#39;t be able to put an end to Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-apple-app-store-trial-023401781.html">courtroom battle</a> with Epic.

Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-fortnite-190920925.html">removed</a><em>Fortnite</em> from the App Store in response, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-maker-epic-games-sues-apple-195415590.html">lawsuit</a> that resulted from that brought to light some very interesting information.

According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-mcflurry-machine-is-broken-again-now-the-ftc-is-on-it-11630522266"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, the agency recently reached out to McDonald’s restaurant owners to collect more information on their experiences with the machines.</p><p>Why is the FTC looking into McFlurry machines, you ask? The answer may have something to do with the right to repair movement. At the start of July, President Biden ordered the agency to draft new rules to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html"><ins>empower consumers and businesses</ins></a> to repair their devices on their own. Later that same month, the FTC made good on that order, voting unanimously to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-right-to-repair-policy-statement-203721173.html"><ins>tackle unlawful repair restrictions</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By all accounts, McFlurry machines are a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aqbm5/mcdonalds-franchises-hack-mcflurry-machines-to-bypass-sanitization-process"><ins>nightmare to repair</ins></a>. Moreover, Taylor, the firm that makes them, is at the center of a legal battle over measures it uses to prevent restaurants from repairing the machines on their own. When a McFlurry machine breaks down, only a certified technician from Taylor is allowed to fix it, leading to long wait times. Those wait times have increased during the pandemic. A federal judge <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ymbp/why-the-mcflurry-machine-company-just-got-hit-with-a-restraining-order"><ins>recently sided with a company</ins></a> that produces a diagnostic tool that threatens Taylor’s monopoly on repairs.</p><p>The FTC hasn’t opened a formal probe yet. “The existence of a preliminary investigation does not indicate the FTC or its staff have found any wrongdoing,” the agency said in the letter it sent out this summer, according to <em>The Journal</em>. However, it reportedly wants to know how often restaurant owners are allowed to work on the McFlurry machines on their own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ftc-mcflurry-letter-221312872.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ad6d1aba-c789-4fd0-9cdf-edbfd54bc576</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 22:13:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630534396</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T22:13:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c025a250-0b6f-11ec-979f-1488c8444308" width="3647" height="2431" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c025a250-0b6f-11ec-979f-1488c8444308" width="3647" height="2431" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mikhail Tereshchenko via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOSCOW, RUSSIA - AUGUST 3, 2020: A woman eats an ice cream in a street.

The social site has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/">banned</a> r/NoNewNormal and quarantined 54 other COVID-19 denial subreddits, but not over the false claims themselves. Instead, it&#39;s for abuse — NoNewNormal was caught brigading en masse (that is, flooding other subreddits) despite warnings, while the other communities violated a rule forbidding harassment and bullying.</p><p>The company didn&#39;t, however, relent on its approach to tackling the misinformation itself. Reddit said it clamps down on posts that encourage a &quot;significant risk of physical harm&quot; or are manipulations intended to mislead others, but made no mention of purging posts or subreddits merely for making demonstrably false claims about COVID-19 or vaccines.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reddit previously defended its position by arguing its platform was meant to foster &quot;open and authentic&quot; conversations, even if they disagree with a widely established consensus. However, that stance hasn&#39;t satisfied many of Reddit&#39;s users. <em>Business Insider</em><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/135-subreddits-are-going-dark-to-protest-reddits-refusal-to-ban-covid-disinformation/ar-AANYZHy">noted</a> 135 subreddits went &quot;dark&quot; (that is, went private) in protest over Reddit&#39;s seeming tolerance of COVID-19 misinformation, including major communities like r/TIFU.</p><p>Critics among those groups contended that Reddit let these groups blossom through &quot;inaction and malice,&quot; and that Reddit wasn&#39;t consistent in enforcing its own policies on misinformation and abuse. As one redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/pfyqqn/covid_denialism_and_policy_clarifications/hb7ovdd/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">pointed out</a>, Reddit&#39;s claims about allowing dissenting ideas don&#39;t carry much weight — the COVID-19 denial groups are presenting false statements, not just contrary opinions.</p><p>The situation is a familiar one. Reddit was accused of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-opportunity-policy-change-002246893.html">dragging its heels on hate speech</a>, responding only when the outcry became too loud to ignore.

The body is only slightly bigger than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/red-6k-komodo-camera-available-083533822.html">Komodo</a>, but it touts a brand new, 35.4-megapixel VV full-frame sensor that offers a large 17 stops of dynamic range and &quot;cinema-quality&quot; scan times twice as fast as any other RED camera.</p><p>You might not have to sacrifice quality for speed, either. The V-Raptor ST can shoot 16-bit REDCODE RAW video at 8K and 120 frames per second, and you can ramp it up to 600 frames per second at 2K if you&#39;re capturing slow-motion shots. While RED may be stretching things by claiming you can &quot;always deliver&quot; at greater than 4K (you clearly need to step down in some situations), you might feel a twinge of regret if your production team spent close to $60,000 on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-15-the-cameras-youtubers-love.html">Monstro 8K</a> that &#39;only&#39; manages 60FPS at full resolution.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new camera includes other creature comforts. A dedicated user display on the side helps assistants tweak settings and save presets, and improved cooling (including a quiet 60mm fan) helps you work in tougher conditions.</p><p>You&#39;ll have access to a wide range of ports, including two 12G-SDI outputs, nine-pin EXT (for breakout boxes), USB-C and the obligatory pogo pin connector for a monitor. ODU output on the side can break out to XLR or 3.5mm audio. Not surprisingly, you&#39;ll want fast storage — RED supports compatible CFexpress 2.0 Type B cards that can record R3D and ProRes at up to 800MB/s.</p><p>The price is squarely in pro filmmaker territory. The body alone sells for $24,500, and you&#39;ll likely want to spend $29,580 on a &quot;Starter Pack&quot; with useful add-ons like a 7-inch touchscreen, a RED 660GB CFexpress card (plus the matching card reader) and a pair of batteries. That&#39;s not including the RF-mount lenses and adapters you might need if you&#39;re new to the RED ecosystem. If you&#39;re the sort who regularly shoots 8K video for a living, though, this might represent a bargain if you&#39;re looking for high-end video equipment.</p><div id="58b10bdde9b24a158f89b41d87072b6f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KmQ8huunigk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/red-v-raptor-st-8k-camera-200544378.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">32dca5ad-5e65-4fc5-9a01-de20b778ce4c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 20:05:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630526217</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T19:57:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/88fbbe70-0b58-11ec-9fff-01bae439f9af" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/88fbbe70-0b58-11ec-9fff-01bae439f9af" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Red]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Red V-Raptor ST 8K pro camera]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Red V-Raptor ST 8K pro camera]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SpaceX says Amazon is trying to delay Starlink because it can't compete]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>SpaceX isn&#39;t pulling any punches in its response to Amazon&#39;s latest stalling tactics.

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-01/apple-asks-all-u-s-employees-to-report-vaccination-status?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company recently sent out a memo requesting workers, whether they currently work out of an office or not, to share that information by September 17th. Apple reportedly plans to use the data it collects to inform its ongoing COVID-19 response.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports the company told employees it would keep their vaccine status “confidential and secure” by aggregating the information but said that could change in the future. “It is possible your vaccination status may be used in an identifiable manner, along with other information about your general work environment such as your building location, if we determine or, if it is required that, this information is necessary in order to ensure a healthy and safe work environment,” Apple said in the memo, according to the outlet. It&#39;s not clear what repercussions if any an employee will face if they do not provide their vaccination status by the deadline.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We’ve reached out to the company for comment.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-vaccine-mandate-181042975.html">Unlike Google</a>, Apple currently does not require employees to be vaccinated before they can come to the office. Still, the company has started to nudge its workers in that direction more forcefully. For example, it recently began a campaign encouraging workers to get their shot.</p><p>The company’s request, and the admission that the information employees share with it may be used in an identifiable manner, come as Apple faces increasing scrutiny over how it handles the privacy of its workers. A recent report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"><em>The Verge</em></a> detailed some of the company’s policies on that front. For instance, one such rule prohibits employees from wiping their work devices before returning them to the company.

A leak shared by <a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124942.html"><em>WinFuture</em></a> and subsequently spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651919/dji-osmo-mobile-5-smartphone-gimbal-selfie-stick"><em>The Verge</em></a> shows the Osmo Mobile 5. New to this model is a telescoping mechanism that will allow you to extend the gimbal. That’s something that should give those who buy the OM 5 more ways to compose their photos and videos. According to the outlet, the device will cost €159 (about $188) and stand approximately 6.7 inches tall when you collapse down the telescoping mechanism.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5ac0c130-0b4a-11ec-b9ff-a71c683ba34b" alt="DJI Osmo Mobile 5" data-uuid="bdc61ea8-69ca-3481-9626-eb415538f3ce"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">WinFuture</div></figure><p>Judging by the images <em>WinFuture</em> shared, it doesn’t look like the Osmo Mobile 5 extends quite as long as a more affordable selfie stick, but that’s probably for the best since the weight of your smartphone and the included magnetic mounting system would make the gimbal unwieldy at best and prone to breaking at worst. Unfortunately, it appears that added flexibility will come at the cost of battery life. The new model can reportedly go six hours and 20 minutes on a single charge. By contrast, you can get up to 15 hours of use from the Osmo Mobile 4’s 2,450mAh battery.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="f827117cbc51435f8cd0eef5143fa74b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">btw...

By the end, even narrator Rod Serling is shown to be a creation of this character’s imagination, making this one of the few <em>TZ</em> episodes where the fourth wall is firmly broken. It took an entire season for that classic program to feel comfortable enough to play around with its format and premise like that. However, we’re only on the fourth installment of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:What If&#x002026;?" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/x9NDA5"><em>What If…?</em></a> and it’s employing similar tactics, though with a less comedic tone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="5a6902b8a5c74268b05f82c9db0fcf3f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vXuQJ3Z-T4E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The first two episodes of <em>What If…?</em> revolved around a simple switch, trading one character for another and seeing how things play out as a result. Last week’s hinged on a minor change — Hope Pym joining SHIELD — that spiraled out with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-three-avengers-disney-plus-175935938.html">huge consequences</a>. This week shows us a simple substitution again, putting Dr. Christine Palmer in the car with Stephen Strange and killing her off in the accident that in another timeline, destroyed the gifted surgeon’s hands instead.</p><p>Her death ends up being the catalyst for Strange studying the mystic arts, and the events shown here pretty much follow the same lines as they did in the film. It’s kind of unlikely, given that a motive to fix one’s injured hands is small peanuts compared to an attempt to undo death. But we still see Stephen training in Kamar-Taj, learning about the Eye of Agamotto and eventually fighting Dormammu. As far as the timeline is concerned, everything is pretty much the same.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f012e870-0b46-11ec-b6ea-f85e7a80cb19" alt="Dr. Strange studying the mystic arts" data-uuid="46619465-4c19-3038-a45f-bb9143ed7ead"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>Except Stephen, who can’t get Christine’s death out of his head. He ends up going back to the moment of the crash and trying to save his girlfriend’s life, only to fail again and again. Since her death was the catalyst for him to learn magic, he can’t use his powers to save her. She is a fixed point, an unchangeable event (something <em>Doctor Who</em> fans will be well acquainted with).</p><p>For the viewer, this raises a big question: If Christine’s death is really such a concrete event in the time stream, how did we end up with “our” Stephen Strange back over in the regular MCU timeline? Here, the episode inspired an intriguing possibility: that perhaps this Doctor Strange will succeed in changing the timeline so that Christine isn’t in the car and he destroys his hands, in fact making this episode a prequel to the 2016 film. That would have been a rather mind bending twist that certainly would have made this series more important, though still not essential, to the MCU.</p><div id="8ae46fcf910a43febab71100ce250d09"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dsQjh63n-jI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Alas, it was not to be, with Strange descending further and further into his obsession to the point where even our narrator is concerned. And for the first time, a character becomes aware that they are being observed and actually calls the Watcher out. Like in the <em>Twilight Zone</em> episode, the sequence is intended as a demonstration of power, showing that Strange has reached the level of awareness to notice the fourth wall. But still his powers are limited; he’s not cognizant of the audience (though Uatu the Watcher is, having addressed us directly earlier in the episode) and his pleas for assistance ultimately go unheeded.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/94ac7870-0b46-11ec-8bff-cec1e1642c7e" alt="Uatu the Watcher, being creepy" data-uuid="93d7c2d8-4bc4-3119-8431-69682125c1e3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>Compared with the first three episodes, this one ends on a dark note. That’s actually truer to the original comic series the show is based on where, freed from the constraints of long-term continuity, the writers could take the story in whatever direction they wanted.

However, it says it&#39;s still on track to release them by the end of the year. The studio listed &quot;late 2021&quot; as the timeframe for those upgrades in its <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/pl/wp-content/uploads-pl/2021/09/h1-2021-results-presentation.pdf"><ins>financial report</ins></a> for the first half of the year.</p><p>The timeline still fits with the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> roadmap that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-212705795.html"><ins>CDPR published in January</ins></a>. At the time, it said the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S upgrades would arrive in the second half of the year. The studio also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-netflix-dlc-214822084.html"><ins>said at WitcherCon in July</ins></a> that a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-3-next-gen-consoles-133730357.html"><ins>free current-gen upgrade</ins></a> for those who own <em>The Witcher 3</em> on PS4 and Xbox One will arrive this year too, along with free DLC — perhaps in time for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-witcher-season-2-netflix-release-date-184949610.html"><ins>season two</ins></a> of the Netflix&#39;s <em>The Witcher</em> series in December.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-glitch-penis-breasts-170449946.html"><ins>abysmal launch of </ins><em><ins>Cyberpunk 2077</ins></em></a>, which by all accounts ran poorly on the base PS4 and Xbox One, CDPR has released several patches and hotfixes to improve stability and performance. The game was in such a bad state at the outset that Sony swiftly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-pulled-sony-012418332.html"><ins>yoinked </ins><em><ins>Cyberpunk 2077</ins></em><ins> from the PlayStation Store</ins></a>, and didn&#39;t allow the game back until <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-playstation-store-124829914.html"><ins>six months later</ins></a> (albeit with a warning about performance on the base PS4).</p><p>The most recent <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>patch included the first batch of promised free downloadable content. However, this only amounted to cosmetic items and a new look for Johnny Silverhand, Keanu Reeves&#39; character. There are still expansions to the game on the way, though.</p><p>Still, given the widespread spate of game delays we&#39;ve seen over the last year or so, including a couple of delays to Cyberpunk 2077 itself, its encouraging that CDPR is still confident about releasing the current-gen upgrades for both games in the next few months.</p><p>Between around a third and 40 percent of CDPR&#39;s developers are currently working on <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>support and the current-gen upgrade, according to a chart in the financial report. It&#39;s hard to tell, since the chart doesn&#39;t include actual percentages. In any case, that&#39;s down from over half of the team as of the end of 2020 as the studio gradually shifts employees to other projects. One of those is the first expansion for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which doesn&#39;t currently have a release window.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7ce73960-0b45-11ec-9caa-bc498b9e1b48" style="height:760;width:1392;" alt="CDPR development staff breakdown" data-uuid="90a71f17-5d08-3a69-a2fc-b1f739c7a874"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CD Projekt Red</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-witcher-3-upgrades-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-cd-projekt-red-172038747.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23227fc3-2160-4a40-b458-693dcf6406e7</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:20:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630516128</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T17:08:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5b815190-ca9d-11eb-aeef-dc94854bd490" width="1918" height="1078" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5b815190-ca9d-11eb-aeef-dc94854bd490" width="1918" height="1078" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CD Projekt Red]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TimTheTatman is the latest major Twitch streamer to defect to YouTube]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/drlupo-youtube-gaming-exclusive-agreement-211213151.html">DrLupo</a> isn&#39;t the only big-name Twitch streamer leaving for YouTube.

Microsoft spurred the first round, paying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-01-ninja-twitch-mixer-fortnite.html">Ninja</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-shroud-twitch-mixer-ninja.html">Shroud</a> and other top streamers to jump ship for Mixer. We wouldn&#39;t expect a similar outcome, though. Mixer struggled to compete against its livestreaming rivals, leading Microsoft to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-mixer-ninja-shroud-streamers-twitch-youtube-facebook-163007393.html">shut the service down</a>. Creators had to quickly find alternatives, and some of them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ninja-twitch-mixer-streaming-170015433.html">returned to Twitch</a> with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/shroud-twitch-return-first-stream-time-193742742.html">exclusivity deals</a>.

While many larger creators have an established YouTube presence for their on-demand videos, that doesn&#39;t guarantee they&#39;ll watch live shows on Google&#39;s service. Even so, this could be a coup for YouTube — and a blow to Twitch if it can&#39;t hold on to its best-known stars.</p><div id="1f3cf3f968f1434b9c846dceb34fa821"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">the future<a href="https://t.co/Hz9YZ0m2EA">https://t.co/Hz9YZ0m2EA</a><a href="https://t.co/ekGwDreHOL">pic.twitter.com/ekGwDreHOL</a></p>— timthetatman👑 (@timthetatman) <a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/timthetatman-leaves-twitch-for-youtube-170753892.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a9f6438a-dca3-47a1-9ea7-99938549598d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 17:07:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630515244</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T16:54:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/17b1fb50-0b42-11ec-bfeb-92380383e240" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/17b1fb50-0b42-11ec-bfeb-92380383e240" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TimTheTatman/Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TimTheTatman announces move from Twitch to YouTube]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TimTheTatman announces move from Twitch to YouTube]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter tests new harassment prevention feature with ‘Safety Mode’]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is experimenting with its most aggressive anti-harassment features to date.

It’s just two minutes long and filled with overlapping shots of drums, mics, guitars and snakelike cables packed into a lonely desert hideaway, all while an unsettling, ambient score gathers layers of sound. Over time, the scenes are flooded with red and the film is overcome by a horrendous groaning scream. Thin white text flashes across the screen, telling a disjointed story about burying bones and walking with the bloom of a burgeoning universe.</p><p>Among this vibrating chaos, there are hints about the kind of studio Eyes Out will be and even what the team’s first game might look like. Or, more aptly, what it might sound like.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="80075cd5f57b4007b643c0b11713e1a0"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Doja9yZOBuU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Eyes Out is the new video game studio founded by Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck and veteran AAA director Cory Davis, and the team is already hard at work on its first title, a mysterious horror game with an emphasis on experimental audio.</p><p>“We want to create mind-bending experiences that cause you to question reality,” Davis said. “That&#39;s what we&#39;re really excited about. We’re all fans of horror, but specifically this kind of — it&#39;s a new and emerging space that doesn&#39;t just sit within the extremely violent and dark and terrifying, but also reaches into the vibrant and even surprises you with moments of bliss or self-reflection. Horror really has a lot of room to grow.”</p><p>Finck added on to that thought, saying, “We&#39;re playing in this field that provides an emotional and psychological response, which really, I feel, is heightened as a singular experience. And we&#39;re really fortunate to be attracting developers who are so genuinely passionate about these types of conversations.”</p><p>Davis has built a successful career as a video game designer, directing and crafting high-profile titles including <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> and <em>Here They Lie</em>, but he’s also a composer. In fact, the first word of his <a href="https://twitter.com/Snak3Fist">Twitter bio</a> reads, “musician.” Meanwhile, Finck’s <a href="https://twitter.com/robinfinck?lang=en">Twitter bio</a> has just two tags, both of which speak for themselves: @eyesoutofficial and @nineinchnails.</p><p>Note which one comes first.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/35d85e60-0a95-11ec-bae8-c275210803da" alt="Eyes Out" data-uuid="3922fa90-6df7-3b58-a539-91f9d4c33048"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Eyes Out</div></figure><p>Finck got involved in the video game industry about six years ago, after striking up a friendship with Devolver Digital co-founder Mike Wilson at Burning Man. Finck ended up handling the soundtrack for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-01-nine-inch-nails-guitarist-robin-finck-soundtrack-noct.html"><em>Noct</em></a>, a top-down horror game published by Devolver in 2015, and his interest in development was piqued. He dove further into the video game industry, attending conventions and connecting with creators.</p><p>“I was just really inspired by people and their enthusiasm, the forward tech of it all, and the collision of art and music, design, agency, narrative, and also the experience of really becoming immersed in all of this,” Finck said. “It really feels like the most focused and the most highly attuned experience to imbibe this sort of storytelling. And that continues to turn me on. And this led me, fortunately enough for me, to meet Cory as he and his team were completing <em>Here They Lie</em>.”</p><p>Eventually, Finck found himself at Sony Santa Monica, playing an early version of Davis’ VR horror title, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA05018_00-DANA000PS4000123/"><em>Here They Lie</em></a>. He was floored by it. Finck and Davis got to talking, and they haven’t stopped since.</p><p>“We immediately were talking about sound and music and the weight of that and the experience,” Finck said. “And we kept on in the coming days and weeks and months. And then eventually were working together on music for projects that Cory was heralding. We have a <em>simpatico</em> workflow and creatively sync in a lot of ways.”</p><p>Davis remembered feeling a spark at that first meeting, too.</p><section data-eng-breakout="aaf39f9096f749c3a479ead7ffe2d9f8" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/35d2b910-0a95-11ec-bbb7-1a3ebe2790f0" alt="Eyes Out"></section><p>“We started to go down the rabbit hole of distortion pedals and different synthesizers and stuff like that,” he said. “But that led us to this other type of discussion where I really felt this connection in terms of an understanding of the power of games as a medium and the impact and the possibility of what the medium holds for the future.”</p><p>Davis and Finck were both interested in building a single-player experience around music and tone, rather than starting with a narrative or visual style and applying sound later on in the process.</p><p>“From the first conversation with Robin, I could feel that he&#39;s this other type of creator that wants to be driven by his passion and his soul, rather than maybe what&#39;s trendy or what&#39;s even necessarily gratifying,” Davis said. “I just felt this kind of depth of possibility of what we could do together. I had other prototypes going on at the time at my old studio, but every time I got back together with Robin, our conversations would go deeper. And they&#39;d go beyond the music and they&#39;d go to places where I&#39;d been hoping to go my whole journey as a game developer.”</p><p>Eyes Out is the result of this creative magnetism between Davis and Finck. They’ve attracted other developers, too, and have hired <a href="https://www.eyes-out.com/team">15 collaborators</a> from the industries of visual art, film and games to work on their first project.</p><p>“That&#39;s really what I&#39;ve been looking for since way back in the <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> days, was to build a team that has a diverse enough approach to both things like the difficulties in game development, as well as their acceptance and embrace of people that are from different parts of the world, from different backgrounds, that are of any kind of personality, and especially people that have been downtrodden and haven&#39;t had opportunities in the past,” Davis said. “We see those opportunities allowing us to have so much more depth in the types of stories that we&#39;re able to tell.”</p><div id="5a27248a9d864e09bd8b483f60ba04b3"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QaAmzYSBCeI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>There’s no name or release window for the studio’s first game, but Davis and Finck are dropping hints about how it’ll play and what they want players to feel. It’s not a VR game, it’s designed with complete immersion in mind, and it features creatures that behave strangely in response to generative audio cues. The team is playing around with rhythm mechanics and figuring out how to build creeping tension through sound.</p><p>“The type of horror that we&#39;re building has a lot to do with the horrors of the universe and the horrors that you kind of go to sleep with at night, the ones that are just around the corner and outside of our purview, but exist,” Davis said. “And the technology for building those types of soundscapes, the localized audio and reverb and the realism behind that, coming from VR before, I had a lot of opportunity to work with that stuff.”</p><p>The debut game from Eyes Out will be a focused, single-player horror experience built around sound — and silence.</p><p>“I&#39;m really excited about the nuance and the subtlety of coming from silence, like a really impactful silence, and beginning to emerge from that silence towards an impactful embellishment of some sort, however great or greater,” Finck said. “And that play between the diegetic soundscape of the world within the tangible, physical space inside the game, and where it blurs with the score, the music of the game, can be really challenging and inspiring.”</p><p>Eyes Out&#39;s first project is poised to be otherworldly, introspective and experimental, just like the studio itself.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">486bf9ba-6ea0-4d85-a85a-e4f1e54ad3ff</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 16:45:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630513787</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T16:30:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d86c8170-0a94-11ec-b7f9-9c42ee9e709b" width="2654" height="1769" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d86c8170-0a94-11ec-b7f9-9c42ee9e709b" width="2654" height="1769" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[RAINER HOSCH]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Eyes Out co-founders Cory Davis and Robin Finck.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Eyes Out]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Qualcomm aptX Lossless delivers CD quality sound over Bluetooth]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a year ago, if you wanted to stream lossless audio tracks to your phone, you essentially had one option: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-tidal-master-audio-android.html"><ins>Tidal</ins></a>. A lot has changed since then, with Apple recently rolling out support for lossless streaming in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html"><ins>June</ins></a>, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-hifi-select-markets-premium-cd-quality-audio-2021-165438547.html"><ins>Spotify</ins></a> promising to do the same later this year. But unless you’re willing to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html"><ins>connect a USB DAC</ins></a> to your phone, more streaming services jumping on the Hi-Res bandwagon does you little good since Bluetooth headphones can only stream lossy audio. Thankfully, that’s about to change.</p><p>Chipmaker Qualcomm is adding a new flavor to its aptX Bluetooth codec, and it’s a lossless one that, in ideal conditions, the company claims delivers CD-quality 16-bit 44.1kHz audio streaming over a wireless connection. Qualcomm says it made improvements to its Bluetooth High Speed Link technology to deliver the required data throughput required to stream a lossless track wirelessly, but the codec can also compress a signal down to 24-bit 96kHz quality to ensure you don&#39;t experience any interruptions. You can also manually switch between 16-bit 44.1kHz and 24-bit 96kHz streaming modes, though the codec will automatically default to the former when it detects a lossless source.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chipsets come with support for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-31-aptx-adaptive-bluetooth-qualcomm.html"><ins>aptX codecs</ins></a> built-in. That means almost any Android phone you buy in North America or Europe will support the standard. As with all Bluetooth codecs, it’s not enough for only your phone, tablet or computer to support the technology. You also need a pair of compatible headphones or earbuds. Qualcomm says the first ones to support aptX Lossless will arrive later this year.</p><p>Before today, the closest you could get to a lossless connection over Bluetooth were Sony’s <a href="https://www.sony.net/Products/LDAC/"><ins>LDAC</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.sony.co.uk/electronics/support/articles/00230269"><ins>DSEE technologies</ins></a>. Those work well, but again you need a pair of Sony headphones to take advantage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-codec-announcement-161851075.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ce29f72f-0c65-49b7-a8f5-1cbffa45b60e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 16:18:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630513134</ingested><modified>2021-09-01T16:19:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8d800250-0b3d-11ec-8c1e-dbe5d885186a" width="8092" height="4982" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8d800250-0b3d-11ec-8c1e-dbe5d885186a" width="8092" height="4982" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PeopleImages via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shot of a young businessman using a smartphone and headphones in the city]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Making business as easy as a day in the park]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Neo QLED 4K TVs now come in very large (and very small) sizes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung is eager to court home theater enthusiasts who want high-end TVs at less-than-common sizes. The tech giant has <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/cedia-2021-samsung-launches-new-products-and-programs-powering-successful-partnerships/">introduced</a> multiple new sizes for some of its premium sets. Most notably, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tvs-release-date-pricing-170114864.html">Neo QLED 4K</a> QN90A series is now available in a huge 98-inch version (85 inches was the previous peak) alongside relatively tiny 43- and 50-inch models. This is ostensibly to allow for more flexible home theater installations, although we could see those smaller sizes proving useful for bedrooms, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-health-qled-tv-smart-trainer-hands-on-160027517.html">connected home gyms</a> and dorm rooms.</p><p>There are additional size options for Lifestyle sets, too. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-the-frame-tv-portrait-mode-160035463.html">The Frame</a> is now available in an 85-inch size for fans of extra-large artwork, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-2021-tv-lineup-availability-150003304.html">The Terrace</a> Full Sun can be had in a 65-inch edition for backyard viewing in bright sunlight.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company didn&#39;t initially provide pricing for all of the new sets (we&#39;ve asked for details).
