The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-09-g20-discuss-big-tech-tax-reform.html">long-in-the-making</a> deal should be official as of today (October 31st) and would be enforced starting in 2023.</p><p>The US originally pitched the concept to prevent companies from using creative accounting (such as the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement">Double Irish arrangement</a>&quot;) to avoid paying most of their taxes in the country. Other countries <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-22-germany-global-minimum-tax-large-tech-companies.html">embraced the idea</a>, though, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/oecd-head-defends-tax-deal-1.6232027">told</a><em>CBC News</em> the move could rake in about $150 billion from corporations around the world.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The deal could discourage tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Netflix from relying on loopholes to maximize their profits. If the deal collects the promised money, governments could better fund public services and help tackle problems like climate change.&nbsp;</p><p>There are numerous criticisms, however, and not just from those who generally oppose higher taxes. Oxfam, for instance, <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/oxfam-criticizes-lack-g20-bold-action-tackle-vaccine-inequality-climate-change-and">blasted</a> &quot;generous carve outs&quot; that protected sone income and take 10 years to phase out. The pro-equality group also claimed the deal was &quot;extremely limited&quot; and would affect fewer than 100 companies while generating little money for poorer countries. The arrangement might beat the status quo for G20 nations, but it won&#39;t necessarily address some outstanding concerns.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/g20-global-minimum-tax-rate-180620093.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9e8e845-fc60-4dc9-9ce0-8e0d2851aae5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 18:06:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635703582</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T18:06:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/47b09b20-3a6f-11ec-abdf-83e1da39acf5" width="8640" height="5760" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/47b09b20-3a6f-11ec-abdf-83e1da39acf5" width="8640" height="5760" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pool via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ROME, ITALY - OCTOBER 30: U.S. President Joe Biden, Democratic Republic of Congo's President and African Union Chair Felix Tshisekedi, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, from row from left, pose with other world leaders for a group photo at the La Nuvola conference center for the G20 summit on October 30, 2021 in Rome, Italy.

In his most recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claimed Apple is aiming for a headset that can handle &quot;high-quality&quot; VR games with both fast chips and high-res displays. While it&#39;s not certain just what chips would be involved, a previous leak mentioned a possible 8K resolution per eye — Apple might not expect games to run at that resolution, but it would hint at serious processing power.</p><p>The headset is still poised to arrive &quot;as early as&quot; 2022, Gurman said. He also suggested Apple would eventually follow up the mixed headset with an augmented-reality-only model, but that was &quot;years down the road.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However accurate the claim might be, it&#39;s doubtful the mixed reality headset would be meant primarily for gaming The price (rumored to be as high as $3,000) might relegate it to developers and other pros. It wouldn&#39;t be a rival to the $299 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Quest 2</a>, then. Instead, the report suggests Apple might use this initial headset to pave the way for more affordable wearables where gaming is more realistic.</p><p>It&#39;s safe to presume Apple is committed to a headset, no matter the end result. Apple has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-buys-nextvr-192608476.html">acquired companies</a> and reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-dan-riccio-vr-ar-headsets-162030193.html">shuffled executives</a> with mixed reality in mind. This wouldn&#39;t just be a side project for the company, even if the mixed reality tech could take years to reach the mainstream. Gaming might play a pivotal role if Apple intends to reach a wider audience.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mixed-reality-headset-vr-games-160752822.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc13ee04-0e70-4dea-b518-87b8944d5d81</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 16:07:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635696474</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T16:08:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/e9503250-0485-11ea-92f9-f25df63dfb60" width="4178" height="2929" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/e9503250-0485-11ea-92f9-f25df63dfb60" width="4178" height="2929" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An Apple employee helps a member of the media try on an HTC Vive while testing the virtual reality capabilities of the new iMac during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose, California on June 5, 2017. / AFP PHOTO / Josh Edelson        (Photo credit should read JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-APPLE-DEVELOPERS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon offers steep discounts on recent Echo devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This may be one of your best chances of scoring a smart speaker or e-reader before the holiday rush.

The newer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Echo Show 5 and 8</a>, meanwhile, build on that Alexa know-how with visuals. The Show 5 fits best as a bedside clock, while the 8 works well for video calls or as a family hub in the kitchen or living room. The main hiccups are simply the interface and streaming app selections — Google has a slight edge in both departments, but that might not matter much if you&#39;re mainly using voice commands or checking the news and weather.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-8-kindle-sale-142212659.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45c394b7-d10c-48d5-b6c8-65e53208a266</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 14:22:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635690135</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T14:22:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/6fcdac00-6bb3-11eb-beff-1423d5073ede" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/6fcdac00-6bb3-11eb-beff-1423d5073ede" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo (2020) smart speaker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo (2020) smart speaker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iRobot's poop-detecting Roomba j7+ vacuum is cheaper than ever right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iRobot&#39;s latest Roomba that can detect obstacles — including pet poop — along its cleaning journey is cheaper than ever right now.

The AI-driven computer vision technology allows the device to detect obstacles and move around them as it cleans, and you can label those obstacles as permanent (in the case of a chair or another piece of furniture) or temporary. Not only does this mean the j7 robots should better navigate around things like piles of clothes and charging cords, but they can also detect a robot vacuum&#39;s arch nemesis: pet poop. iRobot even has a Pet Owner Official Promise (yes, P.O.O.P.) which states that you&#39;ll get a new robot vacuum if your j7+ runs into poop in the first year of you owning it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from that, the j7 series takes advantage of iRobot&#39;s improved mobile app, which lets you schedule cleanings and set routine triggers. You can also label rooms in your home after the robot has created a map, so you can better direct it to a specific room when you only need a quick clean.</p><p>While the clean base included in the j7+ package isn&#39;t necessary, it takes the convenience level up a notch. Instead of emptying your robot&#39;s bin after every job, the j7+ will automatically empty its contents into the clean base when it&#39;s done. You then only have to worry about emptying the base once every two months.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobots-poop-detecting-roomba-j7-plus-vacuum-is-cheaper-than-ever-right-now-123037360.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06add5ac-054c-4440-85ca-bb5f35c1b30a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 12:30:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635683164</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T12:26:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lego adds 'Luigi's Mansion' sets to its Super Mario World collection]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-super-mario-luigi-bowser-airship-110034682.html">Luigi is part of Lego Super Mario</a>, the toymaker is ready to show the other heroic plumber a little more respect. <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/newsroom/">Lego</a> has introduced a trio of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-28-luigis-mansion-3-nintendo-switch-review.html"><em>Luigi&#39;s Mansion</em></a> expansion sets that give its namesake star more to do in a game designed with him in mind.</p><p>The $30 Lab and Poltergust set helps you get started with Luigi&#39;s ghost vacuum, while a $40 Entryway set introduces you to the mansion proper as well as Polterpup and the  game series&#39; Boo ghosts.

And Cherlynn Low used Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro and found that the camera-heavy handsets have a lot more to offer, including a great starting price.</p><h2>The new MacBook Pros have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">ton of power (and ports)</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/86d0a220-38ec-11ec-a5b3-8a860be049ef" alt="Apple MacBook 14- and 16-inch (2021)" data-uuid="b1825893-d730-3e58-a67d-89d139389744"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar says the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:14-" href="https://amzn.to/3vZ88Wj">14-</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:16-inch MacBook Pros" href="https://amzn.to/2ZyVocC">16-inch MacBook Pros</a> are precisely what media professionals have been waiting for: speedy M1 Pro and Max processors, a comfortable keyboard, serious battery life and great speakers. They also feature most of the crucial ports MacBooks have been missing for years, including (finally!) an SD card reader, though the laptops are thicker and heavier as a result. And of course, all that comes with a high starting price of $1,999.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Devindra was particularly impressed by the Liquid Retina XDR displays, which come close to 4K resolutions, and have mini-LED backlighting to produce up to 1,600 nits of brightness. He was also pleased to find support for 120Hz refresh rates, and by the benchmark testing in which both MacBook Pros blew away competing Windows PCs. However, while the laptops were able to speedily convert a 4K video clip to 1080p, Devindra doesn&#39;t think they&#39;d make the best gaming machines — trying to load <em>Borderlands 3 </em>produced an unplayable mess. Overall though, he says these computers have practically everything one, especially a creative professional, would want in a powerful notebook — as long as you can stomach the price tag.</p><h2>The third-gen Airpods have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">better fit and more features</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/11b916b0-38ed-11ec-bdd2-cd470a053d1c" alt="Apple AirPods 3rd-Gen (2021)" data-uuid="f6c7b56c-986d-3366-9ee0-114255c6ccff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple’s latest <a href="https://amzn.to/31jfWqF">AirPods</a> have been almost completely redesigned from the previous version; the buds themselves have a new look, courtesy of the contoured shape which reduces weight and features a tapered silhouette and an angle to increase comfort. Billy Steele says the company’s efforts to build better AirPods have paid off: the new buds are more comfortable and and have much better audio quality, with bigger and more immersive sound that remained open and airy. That’s thanks to a custom driver paired with a high-dynamic-range amplifier, as well as the new H1 chip and the inward facing mic. Billy says these changes made the AirPods something he actively wanted to listen to music with.</p><p>The new AirPods also have an IPX4 rating so they’ll survive sweaty workouts or small splashes. They can also detect skin which, combined with the built-in accelerometer, makes for more accurate pausing and extends battery life. The new chip means you can listen to tracks in Dolby Atmos on Apple Music, and the spatial audio is available with dynamic head tracking to change the position of the audio when you turn your head. However, the latest AirPods still lack active noise cancellation and Transparency mode as these features are still reserved for the pricier AirPods Pro. While Billy acknowledges that these earbuds aren’t for everyone, he says they continue to offer Apple users features that are well integrated with iPhone, iPad and Mac.</p><h2>Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">excellent phones with great prices</a>&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbc195f0-38ef-11ec-a9e2-fd44c6629b33" alt="Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro " data-uuid="df05aa6a-db9f-30d8-bcc6-522c84a7426a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low says the newest Google phones — the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bnGoRv">Pixel 6</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3mpn6l0">6 Pro</a> — are the most intriguing phones that the company has made in years. Featuring the first Google mobile processor, Tensor, the two handsets also have improved camera hardware, lovely OLED screens, speedy refresh rates (120Hz for the 6 Pro, 90Hz for the 6), and decent speakers. Cherlynn says the best feature is the surprisingly low starting price — only $599 — which makes some of the drawbacks more forgivable.</p><p>One of the issues she had with the phones was the laggy under-screen fingerprint sensor, which requires the display to be on before it unlocked — a process that she says doesn’t need to have two steps. She was more impressed by the new voice keyboard, which did an excellent job of transcribing speech, and the additional camera features. The sensors are sharper and bigger with larger pixels, producing bright, clean photos — and special camera features, like Magic Eraser and Face Unblur, give users a lot of control over their photos. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro excelled in our battery tests, too, lasting 20.5 hours and 17 hours, respectively. Overall, Cherlynn calls the handsets a superb return to form, showing off Google’s strengths in the software and photography departments.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-apples-new-macbook-pros-have-nearly-everything-youd-want-160049252.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">634b1803-994b-413e-9fbe-b22038c853a8</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 16:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635539639</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T20:34:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a961-350a-11ec-aeed-d392d87d8e2c" width="2000" height="1241" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a961-350a-11ec-aeed-d392d87d8e2c" width="2000" height="1241" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's worst shipping delay is for a $19 polishing cloth]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;d think <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canalys-smartphone-shipments-q3-2021-190214915.html">global supply shortages</a> would hit Apple&#39;s tech products the hardest, but that&#39;s apparently not the case.

Order the microfiber cloth from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MM6F3AM/A/polishing-cloth">company store</a> as of this writing and you&#39;ll wait 10 to 12 weeks — in other words, you won&#39;t get your Apple-branded polishing experience until January 2022 at the earliest.

Using the new port, it’s possible to get three hours of uptime after 15 minutes of charging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f31d1a40-38f0-11ec-a6b7-3b40ab31ec12" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Arctis 7+" data-uuid="826f3caa-c504-3672-938c-3009701b4f7e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">SteelSeries</div></figure><p>On that note, battery life is also improved. SteelSeries claims you can get up to 30 hours of gameplay on a single charge, up from the approximately 24 hours you got from the previous version. As for the differences between the 7+ and 7P+, there aren’t many. You can buy the latter in both black and white colorways where the former is only available in black. Additionally, the 7P+ includes support for the PlayStation 4 and PS5’s 3D Audio functionality. That said, you can use both headsets with pretty much any system or device other than Xbox consoles.</p><p>The Arctis 7+ and Arctis 7P+ are available to buy today from the <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__nyl.as_t1_294_8u56lfixcjmqaajkwio84hcb6_2_11d0ed3b19c29a96a30f592a5b5930e03c8f7153b6ff78dbe663c4a4aaed4985&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=lpQ468hfON-YVPYCoKRWx9nLjHJnve1xEz23vLxo-Yc&amp;m=ehdInLXexLYqy7pJy-Cu4IBi9bKZHrX-IuaUBKQIlQE&amp;s=8V8KUb1_KuoDHp4Xwma_BS7zP3pKqNmPffnHMBfu78I&amp;e=">SteelSeries website</a>. They’ll both set you back $170. That’s an increase from the $150 MSRP of Arctis 7 and 7P, but what&#39;s an extra $20 when you don&#39;t have to deal with micro USB anymore.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/steelseries-arctis-7-7plus-annoucement-195740872.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">886ba982-655b-41ac-aeb8-13a090068db0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 19:57:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635537465</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T19:57:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4e47050-38f0-11ec-bfed-777eea110f83" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4e47050-38f0-11ec-bfed-777eea110f83" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SteelSeries]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arctis 7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arctis 7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla recalls nearly 3,000 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over separating suspensions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla is <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2020/TESLA/MODEL%252520Y/SUV/AWD#recalls">recalling</a> 2,791 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over concerns that their front suspension lateral link fasteners may loosen, potentially shifting the wheel alignment and increasing the risk of a crash.

As of September 30th, the company said it held equity investments, &quot;including preferred stock of Rivian Automotive,&quot; valued at $3.8 billion, up from $2.7 billion at the end of 2020. That Amazon should own a fifth of Rivian is not surprising. In 2019, the retailer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-15-amazon-rivian-investment-electric-pickup-truck-suv.html">led a $700 million investment round</a> in the automaker, contributing about $440 million to that total.&nbsp;</p><p>That same year, it announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-19-jeff-bezos-amazon-climate-change-paris-agreement.html">as part of its 2040 climate pledge</a> it would purchase 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian.

According to Riot associate art director Sean Marino, the Battlepass is focused on bringing some fall holiday vibes to the game.

On Friday, Marvel announced its working with Hennig’s Skydance New Media studio on a new <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/games/skydance-new-media-marvel-entertainment-all-new-interactive-title"><ins>narrative-driven action-adventure game</ins></a> set in its comic book universe.

It’s an honor to be able to tell an original story with all the humanity, complexity, and humor that makes Marvel characters so enduring and to enable our players to embody these heroes that they love.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In some ways, it’s a surprise to find out Hennig is working on a AAA title. When she left EA after the publisher <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-17-ea-shuts-down-visceral-games.html"><ins>shut down Visceral</ins></a>, it seemed like she wanted a change of pace. &quot;I would love to have a little company of about six to eight people, 15 at the most, and then do smaller projects,&quot; she said at the time. But then the possibility of working with Marvel may have been too difficult to ignore, especially for a new studio working on its first-ever game. Much like it’s done in Hollywood, the company has started to pull in talent from every corner of the gaming industry.

Because we’ve seen this sort of behavior before. It’s called greenwashing.</p><h2>What is Greenwashing?</h2><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/greenwashing"><ins>Merriam-Webster</ins></a> defines greenwashing as “expressions of environmentalist concerns especially as a cover for products, policies, or activities.” The term was first coined in 1986 by environmentalist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Westerveld"><ins>Jay Westerveld</ins></a> in an essay examining <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150923212726/http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/02/12/the-history-of-greenwashing-how-dirty-towels-impacted-the-green/"><ins>the hotel industry’s practice</ins></a> of leaving placards in guest rooms admonishing them to reuse their towels to help “save the environment.” Back then, people <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/aug/20/greenwashing-environmentalism-lies-companies"><ins>got their news from three places</ins></a>: newspapers, television and radio — the same sources for virtually all advertising at the time. This information availability imbalance created a system wherein corporations could promote themselves in any flattering shade they wished, regardless of their actual actions, with little fear of the public actually realizing that a deception had even occurred.</p><p>The practice of greenwashing in America goes as far back as 1953 — though it wasn’t called as such at the time — when beverage manufacturers launched the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/05/899391551/reframing-history-the-litter-myth"><ins>Keep America Beautiful</ins></a> campaign, reminding the public to be good environmental stewards and not litter, in what was actually an effort to forestall incoming regulations on the use of disposable containers. Greenwashing metastasized in the 1980s as Big Oil companies ladled out their own laudations while they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings"><ins>sought to minimize their own liability and culpability</ins></a> in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-exxonmobil-20170822-story.html"><ins>environmental pollution scandals</ins></a> and global warming. These companies went so far as to work to actively prevent the government from <a href="https://influencemap.org/report/Climate-Lobbying-by-the-Fossil-Fuel-Sector"><ins>passing clean energy laws</ins></a>. But you wouldn’t know it from their television ads.</p><div id="3e43c1176cca4f3a85044c65bfdafa02"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bReBO55XzZc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The spot above is from ​​Chevron’s People Do campaign.

If these experiences tell us anything, it&#39;s that the Exxon tiger hasn&#39;t changed its stripes.&quot;</p><h2>Greenwashing in the modern era</h2><h3></h3><p>Greenwashing remains a widely-used marketing tactic even today — and not just the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq-ZupAJTyY"><ins>mealy-mouthed word salads regurgitated by oil executives</ins></a> during a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/28/climate/oil-executives-house-disinformation-testimony.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes"><ins>House Oversight Committee hearing this Thursday</ins></a>.</p><p>Take bottled water, for instance.

Coca-Cola came under fire in 2015 in Australia when it rolled out Coke Life, a supposedly light sugar variant packaged in a bright green can. Sure it made consumers feel like they were making a health conscious purchasing decision but that was despite <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/healthcare/cocacola-accused-of-greenwashing-with-launch-of-sugarreduced-coke-life-20150330-1mas6u.html"><ins>health advocates pointing out that</ins></a> “the reduction to 10 teaspoons of sugar in a 600ml bottle made little difference in terms of health impacts.” More recently the company launched its <a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/news/why-a-world-without-waste-is-possible"><ins>World Without Waste</ins></a> campaign which, at its essence, pushed consumers to simply recycle more, rather than actually adjust the way the company conducts its business.</p><div id="2674d7a223734153b65c7e8b5d3af9bb"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The fashion industry is a huge contributor to the climate-and ecological emergency, not to mention its impact on the countless workers and communities who are being exploited around the world in order for some to enjoy fast fashion that many treat as disposables. 1/3 <a href="https://t.co/pZirCE1uci">pic.twitter.com/pZirCE1uci</a></p>— Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/GretaThunberg/status/1424423822854397960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>In 2013, <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/greenwashing-or-real-prog_b_3503137"><ins>Tyson Meats was taken to task</ins></a> over the fawning self-framing of how it cares for its animals and their relative well-being, not two years before <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/10/27/mercy-for-animals-accuses-tysons-of-abuse-at-mississippi-chicken-slaughterhouse/74704928/"><ins>five Tyson supplier employees were charged with 33 counts of criminal animal cruelty</ins></a> for repeatedly kicking and punching pigs.

Because it is far more profitable to simply adjust public perception than it is to make meaningful reforms. <a href="https://nielseniq.com/global/en/insights/analysis/2015/the-sustainability-imperative-2/"><ins>A 2015 Nielsen poll</ins></a> found that 66 percent of respondents would be willing to pay a premium for “environmentally sustainable products” and among those willing to pay more more than 50 percent were influenced by sustainability factors such as “a company being environmentally friendly (58 percent), and company being known for its commitment to social value (56 percent.)”</p><p>It’s also because we, collectively, keep falling for it. Consumers’ desires to help address the climate crisis, especially in the face of barely tepid responses from world governments, primes us to view virtually any action on that account as a positive one. “SDGs [<a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals"><ins>Sustainable Development Goals</ins></a>] and ‘net zero’ have kind of created an opportunity for a lot more greenwashing, because it allows you to describe yourself as a green company when you’re doing a thing that’s fundamentally not green,” Dave Powell, co-presenter of the <a href="http://www.sustainababble.fish/"><em><ins>Sustainababble</ins></em></a> podcast and the former Head of Environment at the New Economics Foundation, told <a href="https://www.clientearth.org/latest/latest-updates/stories/greenwashing-the-tipping-point/"><em><ins>Client Earth</ins></em></a>. “You effectively buy your way out of trouble, for example, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-07-30/what-happens-after-pledges-to-plant-millions-of-trees"><ins>by promising to plant large numbers of trees</ins></a>.”</p><p>&quot;As part of their climate strategies, many companies are relying on voluntary carbon offsetting. However, if not done well, offsetting can result in greenwashing,” Dr. Aoife Brophy Haney, Research Lecturer at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment at the University of Oxford, added. “To mitigate this risk, government and society at large should support the use of best practice guidelines, such as the recently released ‘<a href="https://www.smithschool.ox.ac.uk/publications/reports/Oxford-Offsetting-Principles-2020.pdf"><ins>Oxford Principles for Net Zero Aligned Carbon Offsetting</ins></a>’, to help ensure offsetting is done in a rigorous and credible way that ultimately contributes to net zero goals.&quot;</p><p>And, most importantly, companies continue to engage in greenwashing because there is very little downside to doing so, at least from a regulatory perspective. In the US, <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/environmental-claims-summary-green-guides"><ins>the FTC guidelines for environmental marketing claims are only voluntary</ins></a>, though the FTC does retain the right to <a href="https://sustainablebrands.com/read/marketing-and-comms/ftc-cracking-down-on-misleading-unsubstantiated-biodegradability-claims"><ins>prosecute outright false or misleading advertisements</ins></a>.</p><p>However, cracks in the greenwashing facade may be beginning to show, starting in the financial sector, as regulators’ interest in <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/best-esg-funds#:~:text=ESG%20funds%20are%20mutual%20funds,funds%20are%20not%20individual%20stocks."><ins>ESG fund</ins></a> (environmental, social and governance) oversight grows. As <a href="https://www.fnlondon.com/articles/greenwashing-probes-prompt-panic-among-esg-funds-theres-a-big-reputational-risk-20211025"><em><ins>Financial News London</ins></em></a> reported Monday, German asset manager DWS <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-06/deutsche-bank-s-dws-orders-fresh-probe-into-esg-greenwash-claims"><ins>has recently been investigated</ins></a> by both US and German regulatory agencies after a former employee accused the company of fudging the environmental credentials in its 2020 annual report.</p><p>“You have to be careful, as there is a big reputational risk,” an unnamed senior executive at a European asset manager, told <em>FN London</em>. “We’re not saying we were bulls***ing before, but there’s a recognition now that it’s more complicated.”</p><p>“Most have probably been a bit too pushy in marketing their alleged ESG expertise and they are now applying more caution,” ​​Philip Kalus, managing partner at consultancy Accelerando Associates, added. “Some would even say there is panic in the house. Nobody wants to be the next one being accused, but it is an important and overdue wake-up call for the industry.”</p><div id="79b61a221f15426c812e2a6aaed705a7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MbHuSHGZf5U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>That’s not to say that environmental pledges made by Apple, Google, Microsoft or Amazon are meant to intentionally gaslight the public (though Exxon, Shell and Chevron absolutely did). These companies have a vested financial interest in at least appearing as positively as possible to their customers because, frankly, nobody’s going to have time to talk about the slick new features of the Pixel 8 or iOS 15 when we’re in the midst of a global climate meltdown-slash-<a href="https://www.undispatch.com/bad-news-world-will-begin-running-water-2050-good-news-not-2050-yet/"><ins>water war</ins></a>.</p><p>Is Google’s “moonshot goal” of operating its data centers and campuses entirely on carbon-free energy by 2030 going to make more than a blip of difference when it comes to mitigating the impacts of climate change? Probably not, definitely not on its own and certainly no more so than Microsoft’s promise to reduce water use in its data centers by 95 percent by 2024 or Apple’s plan to build robots <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-21-apples-liam-robot-takes-apart-your-iphone-for-recycling.html"><ins>to more effectively recycle old handsets</ins></a>. But these claims do not, in and of themselves, constitute greenwashing. Their changes may not be enough to make a noticeable impact at this point, but these good faith efforts attempt to do something, <em>anything</em>, to stave off what could well be humanity’s self-inflicted extinction. And given how America’s most recent effort to invest in environmentally responsible energy technologies was single-handedly killed off by the coal-loving Senator from West Virginia, these sorts of corporate initiatives may likely be the best we’ll soon see.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/is-big-tech-greenwashing-its-environmental-responsibilities-ahead-of-cop-26-170038455.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f44f9aad-26dd-4c9e-b58b-9bbaf124bd48</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635525046</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T16:31:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2353c710-3868-11ec-bef7-14f30f9a0ec8" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2353c710-3868-11ec-bef7-14f30f9a0ec8" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2021/10/24: An activist dressed as a 'scrubber' cleans the 'greenwashing machine' during the protest outside the Science Museum.

Earlier this year, Miyazaki shared details with Engadget about how Lady Dimitrescu came to be, from concept to mocap, including the ways actress Maggie Robertson brought her to legendary life.</p><p><strong><em>Engadget:</em></strong><strong> Did Lady Dimitrescu&#39;s design change throughout development?</strong></p><p><em>Masato Miyazaki:</em> Alcina Dimitrescu’s incredible height was conceived from the beginning and was not changed during development. The same goes for her wide brim hat and her white dress as well. However, the characteristic of her long protruding nails was something added part way through the development process. It was an idea that was implemented later as a means of adding physical elements that would make her more terrifying when you encounter her.</p><p><strong>Lady Dimitrescu is alluring and seductive </strong>—<strong> was she always meant to be a sultry character, or did that emerge during mocap?</strong></p><p>In the early stages of development, she was described as a bewitching character who would capture and toy with her victims. She was designed to embody equal parts beauty and horror. Based on this, the scenario writer fleshed her characterization out even further with dialogue, but she wasn’t fully realized just yet. It was through Maggie’s performance that the character was finally given life.</p><p>As with any character, I believe that the moment the script is handed over to the actor, the character becomes theirs. The character&#39;s personality and intentions are very much refined by the actor. The character Lady Dimitrescu was truly realized and came to fruition with each of Maggie’s performances.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe295820-3834-11ec-a44b-5486ec0bd096" alt="Lady Dimitrescu (Maggie Robertson) in Resident Evil Village" data-uuid="944ebc48-bc9c-34a5-abc5-b0d7327e2427"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Capcom</div></figure><p><strong>What tricks did you use to make Maggie Robertson as tall as possible during mocap sessions?</strong></p><p>Although Maggie Robertson is quite tall herself, she still cannot reach the height that we envisioned for Lady Dimitrescu. Utilizing some means of extending out her height would jeopardize her performance, so it wasn’t something we could consider. We asked Maggie to act naturally. However, that still left us with the height difference between Maggie and Lady Dimitrescu that had to be addressed. We devised a few methods to counteract this issue.</p><p>First off, we shot with a mixture of backgrounds according to two standards: human scale and Lady Dimitrescu scale. While other characters performed with surroundings that fit human scale, Lady Dimitrescu’s acting was done in front of a background that fit her scale. Everyone performed with one another, but with this mixture of environments. We figured this would be the best means of allowing the actors to give their best performances without any kind of impediment. We made sure the furniture was laid out in a way so that the actors would be facing each other.</p><p>The other aspect that we made sure to stay conscious of was making sure the actors’ lines of sight were in the right positions. We set up markers so that the actors could imagine the correct height. These markers show the correct position of the eye lines and where the limbs actually are. It&#39;s a simple adjustment, but it makes a big difference in the actors&#39; performances.</p><div id="b57949c2c9fd4690a3b380e2e834efcd"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">How the sausage gets made part 2: This is what we used to mark Lady D&#39;s actual size and eye lines.

We carefully set up the rigs of the CG characters to gracefully handle as much of the physical differences between the character and actor as possible. We wanted to make sure that we set things up so that the animators would have a relatively easier time handling any kind of miscalculations that happened along the way.</p><p><strong>What was the strangest prop you used throughout the mocap process?</strong></p><p>There are several, but there are two that I would like to mention. The first is the cane carried by the old woman we meet at the beginning of the village. When you see it in the game, it’s a strange artifact with a lot of components jingling about. The studio crew crafted a prop that resembles the design.</p><p>The second is the goggles that our actor Todd wore as he played the role of Ethan Winters. Since the game is from a first-person perspective through the eyes of Ethan Winters, the camera movements are based on the movements of Todd&#39;s head. Todd reprises his role as Ethan from the previous game and his performances are absolutely excellent, but there were moments where the camera would go wild during more heated scenarios. In order to suppress this from happening, the studio engineer created a pair of special goggles by hand.&nbsp;</p><p>They actually turned out to look very similar to swimming goggles. The assumption was that the narrower field of vision would result in less head movement. I’m still not entirely sure how effective they ended up being, but the engineer’s enthusiasm and Todd having fun wearing the goggles are one of the many wonderful memories I have from the whole experience.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-lady-dimitrescu-mocap-interview-halloween-2021-163032866.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b3a5bf4-595d-4788-842b-80db5c238754</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 29 Oct 2021 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635524142</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T16:15:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8831d780-3836-11ec-bfe7-b1f747ceb39f" width="870" height="473" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/64ebd7d0-3836-11ec-b3ee-895b0690b883" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Capcom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lady Dimitrescu]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lady Dimitrescu]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[We won't have electric airplanes until battery tech improves]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today’s commercial airliners are not exactly fuel efficient.

To be fair though, due to inefficiencies inherent to internal combustion engines, that figure drops to around 14 times the energy density of a li-ion battery if you’re comparing equal weights of fuel and batteries.</p><p>For example, a Tesla Model 3’s li-ion-based battery boasts an energy density of 260 Wh/kg while <a href="https://cleantechnica.com/2021/07/30/catl-reveals-sodium-ion-battery-with-160-wh-kg-energy-density/"><ins>CATL announced earlier this year</ins></a> that it had built a sodium-ion battery with 160 Wh/kg density (though it hopes to get that up to 200 Wh/kg by 2023).

When a battery cell, or even an area within a single cell, malfunctions due to mechanical, thermal, or electrochemical failure, its temperature can rise beyond safe levels causing the cell to first produce lithium off-gasses, causing the cell walls to bulge, then rupture, releasing the entirety of its energy reserve. When a cell bursts it can damage and overheat surrounding cells, setting off a cascading failure that results in explosion and fire. When that happens to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-chevy-bolt-over-battery-fire-reports-230044311.html"><ins>Chevy Volt</ins></a>, the car will likely be a write off (fingers crossed it didn’t also set your house on fire) but if <a href="https://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/251352/251352.pdf#page=187"><ins>such a failure</ins></a> were to occur in-flight on an electrified 747, the loss of life would be catastrophic.</p><p>To minimize the chances of a full-blown runaway from occurring, <a href="https://www.energy-storage.news/preventing-thermal-runaway-in-lithium-ion-energy-storage-systems/"><ins>early detection of cell failures is key</ins></a>. As off-gassing typically occurs minutes before a cell ruptures, the presence of a monitoring system which compares sensors positioned close to a li-ion battery against those collected by a reference sensor further away can alert for the presence of a failing cell. And to negate any gases that have already been released, fire suppression systems armed with inert gas — to prevent the offgasses from reaching combustible levels when mixed with atmospheric oxygen — can be employed as well. Of course regular maintenance and robust inspections also help prevent cell failures before the situation becomes explosive.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f3cafc0-373e-11ec-bfff-d4dbaf919a6b" style="height:1365;width:2048;" alt="Spirit of Innovation" data-uuid="4c5c22ac-9ece-31e7-ad42-e873a391ba40"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rolls-Royce</div></figure><p>Battery electric planes will also provide unique challenges in balancing air speed and range, though for Rolls-Royce, it’s not even a question — speed all the way. Over the past few years, Rolls-Royce has been quietly working on <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/innovation/accel.aspx"><ins>Project ACCEL</ins></a> (accelerating electrification of flight), building a battery-powered racing plane, dubbed <em>Spirit of Innovation</em>, in an effort to set a new world air speed record.</p><p>The record was <a href="https://assets.new.siemens.com/siemens/assets/api/uuid:7ff949a8-679e-4922-b421-cc9d34909ede/PR2017040256COEN.pdf"><ins>previously set in 2017</ins></a> when an electric-powered <a href="https://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/extra-330le-electric-aircraft/"><ins>Extra 330LE</ins></a>, using a Siemens eAircraft-built power plant, notched a 209.7 mph (337.5 kph) top speed over a 3-kilometer-long course. The feat was certified by the World Air Sports Federation (FAI) as the fastest electrically powered flight by an aircraft weighing less than 1,000 kg at takeoff, beating the previous record (set in 2013) by just over 8 mph (13 kph).</p><p>In addition to the 3-kilometer record, Rolls-Royce has the opportunity to also set FAI records for a 15km distance and “time to altitude,” basically how quickly the plane can take off and reach a specific height. “It needs to be a significant number,” Rolls-Royce Director of Engineering and Technology – Civil Aerospace, Simon Burr, told <a href="https://www.aerosociety.com/news/race-for-power/"><em><ins>Aerosociety</ins></em></a>. “We’re planning to fly over 300mph.

One has been used for ground testing while the second will conduct the actual flights. The Nemesis NXT already holds the 3km FAI record with a recorded top speed of 415mph (667.8km) using a 400hp Lycoming internal combustion engine.</p><p>The Rolls-Royce team has swapped that Lycoming engine out for a trio of YASA 750v electric motors producing around 400kW (530hp) while the fuel tank has been replaced with three independent battery packs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f3fbd00-373e-11ec-bef9-7e9ade54bdcc" style="height:931;width:1980;" alt="Spirit of Innovation" data-uuid="c70f3aec-b5cf-3c58-937f-e55b28879658"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Rolls-Royce</div></figure><p>“The main challenge of electrification is weight,” Rolls-Royce Flight Test Engineer Andy Roberts said during a September media briefing. Not only did the 6,000-cell battery system aboard the Nemesis NXT shift the aircraft’s center of balance, the 450kg battery system also doesn&#39;t get lighter over time as conventional fuel tanks would, which could impact the plane’s performance during the later stages of the run. The batteries are so substantial that Rolls-Royce Chief Test Pilot Phill O’Dell had to lose 2kg of bodyweight to help keep the overall aircraft weight within operating margins.</p><p>Thermal runaway is a very real concern for the Rolls-Royce team, as they’ll be pushing these batteries to their absolute limits during the flight. In order to mitigate this issue cells are separated by liquid-cooling plates and stored in cork-wrapped fireproof cases (the porous cork material helps diffuse heat). Should a cell overheat to the point of venting off-gasses, the plane is equipped with an inert gas suppression and ventilation system as well.</p><div id="68c747635feb4e9bb8de9f8800ff27db"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/EC8aZkq" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>On September 15th, the <em>Spirit of Innovation</em> made its maiden test flight from the UK Ministry of Defence’s <a href="https://www.raf.mod.uk/our-organisation/stations/mod-boscombe-down/"><ins>Boscombe Down</ins></a> airfield, flying for 15 minutes. The company hopes to have the Nemesis ready for an official run at the record before the end of this year.</p><p>“The first flight of the <em>Spirit of Innovation</em> is a great achievement...
