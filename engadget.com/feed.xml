According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/funds/undersea-cable-fault-could-cut-off-tonga-rest-world-weeks-2022-01-18/"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22891031/tonga-volcano-eruption-broke-undersea-internet-cable-repair"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the Tonga government has <a href="https://twitter.com/ConsulateKoT/status/1483384039826464768">warned</a> internet access is &quot;down&quot; following damage to the lone undersea fiber optic cable keeping the archipelago online. While the country didn&#39;t provide an initial estimate, the Southern Cross Cable Network&#39;s Craige Sloots told <em>Reuters</em> it might take as long as two weeks to repair the cable &quot;all things going well.&quot;</p><p>It will take the repair ship up to nine days to travel from Papua New Guinea to Tonga, according to Sloots. The timing for the repair will also hinge on safety clearance and any lingering activity from the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha&#39;apai volcano. The 514-mile cable is secured through a Fiji relay.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tonga has been somewhat prepared for incidents like this. It struck a 15-year agreement for satellite internet access with Kacific in 2019 after damage to the underwater cable. However, <em>ZDNet</em><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kacific-waiting-for-tongan-contract-activation-to-supply-satellite-services-post-eruption/">learned</a> a contract dispute with Kacific kept that access from being activated. Officials said the country&#39;s two telecoms were &quot;working on satellite options&quot; to restore service, but didn&#39;t provide timelines.</p><p>The outage underscores the vulnerability of internet access for island nations and other remote communities. While many countries connect to the rest of the world <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-subsea-cable-grace-hopper-london-spain-132503991.html">through undersea cabling</a>, these more distant areas are frequently dependent on either a very limited cable network or expensive satellite service that can degrade in bad weather. Until these places have more reliable cables or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-100000-starlink-satellite-internet-terminals-051812274.html">lower-cost satellite data</a>, they can&#39;t depend on the internet for vital services to the degree other regions can.</p><div id="bb7d3dd4a7ec4f8e9b48dc3bf5faa6be"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">FIRST OFFICIAL UPDATE FOLLOWING THE VOLCANIC ERUPTION FROM THE GOVERNMENT OF TONGA 🇹🇴 <a href="https://t.co/fX3KPlKx2E">pic.twitter.com/fX3KPlKx2E</a></p>— Consulate of the Kingdom of Tonga (@ConsulateKoT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConsulateKoT/status/1483384039826464768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tonga-internet-cut-off-volcano-eruption-152450410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc96568e-72b7-4275-aca1-6256bc4c2dcf</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 15:24:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642605891</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T15:24:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/55823660-7934-11ec-bb1f-a5bf10ec15d3" width="8711" height="5739" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/55823660-7934-11ec-bb1f-a5bf10ec15d3" width="10365" height="6829" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Maxar via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HUNGA TONGA-HUNGA HA'APAI, TONGA – DECEMBER 24, 2021: In this image 2. of a series created on January 19, 2022, Maxar overview satellite imagery shows the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano on December 24, 2021, before the eruption on January 14th , 2022 in Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai Islands, Tonga.

Nowadays, it&#39;s not just patties that can do a convincing impersonation of animal products, and it&#39;s not just Impossible Foods. Between Impossible and its biggest competitor, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/beyond%20meat/">Beyond Meat</a>, we&#39;ve also seen plant-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-foods-chicken-nuggets-190923352.html">chicken nuggets</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-sausage-nationwide-restaurants-yelp-diner-160015325.html">sausage</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-foods-plant-based-pork-restaurants-us-hong-kong-singapore-233051113.html">pork</a>, &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/beyond-meat-chicken-kfc-nationwide-162015106.html">KFC</a>&quot; and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/taco-bell-beyond-meat-2021-222304025.html">taco meat</a>. But you don&#39;t often hear about attempts to mimic a different animal-based product: milk.</p><p>And when you do hear of plant-based milks, it&#39;s more likely to be dairy alternatives like almond milk, soy milk or oat milk. Even then, it&#39;s rare for a dairy-free version to taste like the real thing. That’s exactly the selling point of Silk’s new line of plant-based milk, Nextmilk. It will be available in both full fat and reduced fat versions (MSRP is $4.99 for a 59-ounce carton). It’s going on sale today in grocery stores like Target, Kroger, Publix and HEB, among others.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I tried a sample of <a href="https://goto.target.com/QOGXXM">Silk’s Nextmilk</a> last week and while it’s tasty, I wasn’t fooled into thinking it tastes like cow&#39;s milk. It tastes more like a richer, fattier version of oat milk. It does have a similar creamy mouthfeel to regular milk and the taste is a little closer to dairy than other plant-based milks I’ve tried, but it doesn’t quite replace dairy for me.</p><p>The ingredients list reflect what I tasted: It consists primarily of oat milk, plus smaller proportions of coconut milk, coconut oil, soy protein isolate, chicory root extract, cane sugar, sunflower oil, a vitamin and mineral blend, sea salt, locust bean gum, gellan gum, sunflower lecithin, soy lecithin and “natural flavor.”</p><p>Still, it’s quite delicious, and it might be close enough to dairy for some people. When eaten with cereal or as an accompaniment to cookies, for example, I thought Nextmilk was a more than acceptable substitute. It also mixes well in coffee and tea. “Silk Nextmilk was specially formulated to meet dairy-lovers’ taste expectations through a remarkably delicious blend of plants that are designed to deliver on key attributes of dairy milk, like taste and texture,&#39;&#39; a Danone (Silk’s parent company) spokesperson told Engadget.</p><p>Additionally, Danone says that Nextmilk can be used as a one-to-one alternative to traditional dairy milk in recipes. At the same time, however, the company is also working on another product called So Delicious Wondermilk, which arrives next month and was specifically developed for culinary purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>“While Silk Nextmilk is meant for everyday dairy lovers and offers great versatility [...] Wondermilk beverages were developed with culinary-focused consumers in mind and taste great in recipes,” the spokesperson said. When it arrives, Wondermilk will only be available through natural food channels like Whole Foods and Sprouts.&nbsp;</p><p>Danone is not the first to attempt a dairy-free alternative that tastes closer to real milk. Impossible Foods, the company behind the Impossible Burger, is also working on this, with a product tentatively called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-milk-154404741.html">Impossible Milk</a>. However, its availability is still unknown.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/silk-nextmilk-150024732.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f5f7bcde-db66-4dcb-9cf3-0cb90c2f3ed1</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 15:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642600278</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:51:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nutrition]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/990e4200-78cd-11ec-bdbd-acd7d27f4437" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/990e4200-78cd-11ec-bdbd-acd7d27f4437" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Silk Nextmilk]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Silk Nextmilk]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Backbone One made cloud gaming on the iPhone feel natural]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Whether it’s Xbox Cloud gaming, Stadia, PlayStation Remote Play or just a very severe addiction to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-arcade-games-140053796.html">Apple Arcade</a>, gamepads are a better way to play many games on your smartphone of choice. Normally that means using some kind of smartphone clip to attach your phone to your existing controller, propping up your phone and hoping for the best, or choosing from an increasing selection of controllers that snap directly onto your phone. Instead of demanding compatible phone cases or separate pieces that connect either side of the phone, the $100 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Backbone One" href="https://amzn.to/33uO8kp">Backbone One</a> is a single-piece controller that extends to fit it.</p><p>Unlike the Razer Kishi, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-kishi-smartphone-game-controller-android-review-150009052.html">we tested in detail here</a>, the One is a single device with a telescopic backplate that fits around any iPhone. (With some help: the One isn’t compatible with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone 13 Pro</a>. Backbone has, however, started providing a soft rubberized adapter that slides into the controller, ensuring the latest, bigger iPhones fit snugly and securely.)</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10572460-7925-11ec-b4bb-c61945547d2b" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Backbone One controller review" data-uuid="9a93d5c7-60a2-3f21-8b7c-6c96fefb3420"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget/Mat Smith</div></figure><p>So why invest in another controller for your phone when most mainstream console gamepads you probably already own already do the job? There are a few reasons. Backbone One, with its direct Lightning connection, sidesteps the extra jeopardy that comes with Bluetooth-connected controllers, which introduce another latency bump in the road. The company has wisely included a charger pass-through (gaming can burn through your battery) so you can keep your phone plugged in as you play.</p><p>The device has a subtle matte black finish, with two collar buttons on each side, a four-button layout on the right side (X, Y, A, B), a slightly-too-spongy d-pad on the left and an analog stick on each side. The sticks feel a little looser than others I’ve used, but they’re accurate and comfortable.</p><p>Backbone struck a deal with Microsoft, offering a one-month trial of Xbox’s Game Pass Ultimate for new Backbone owners. It said so on the box, it says it in the app, and it’ll say it in an email if you register the controller. You will get the hint.</p><p>The button layout does lean more towards Xbox gamers, but my PlayStation muscle memory meant I didn’t have too many issues using the One to play my PS5 remotely – just the usual drawbacks of playing with a controller that isn’t a DualSense, with its unique tricks and features. Using the touchpad will mean reaching for a section of the iPhone screen, while you’re not going to get any haptic feedback from the triggers or controller itself.</p><p>There are a handful of buttons in addition to the stable gaming ones. The orange button launches Backbone’s own game portal (part of the BackBone iOS app), while others offer screen and video sharing shortcuts or what you’d expect when pressing start or menu on console controllers.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c5fd10eb1199462a9bf7e94a78ba500b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10572461-7925-11ec-bffb-f879e7253d34" alt="Backbone One controller review" data-uuid="3da1c316-a661-397c-85c3-c525f0d3bdb8"></section><p>The controller’s namesake, the spring-loaded backplate, ensures that once your phone is in place, it all feels solid and unified. The controls aren’t going to pull away, nor is there a chance of your phone slipping out. The more I spent playing through <em>Alan Wake</em>, then <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html"><em>Deathloop</em></a>, as well as Apple Arcade titles like <em>Fallen Knight </em>and<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-hironobu-sakaguchi-fantasian-interview-apple-arcade-150022942.html"><em>Fantasian</em></a>, the more it started to blur into a handheld – one with a high-resolution OLED screen. Unfortunately, you will have to remove any cases to ensure it fits inside the controller chassis.</p><p>The companion app has a few useful tricks. It can capture, edit and upload gaming content, and it’s pretty intuitive. I don’t usually capture gameplay unless it’s for work, but I’ve already used Backbone’s implementation to send short clips to friends. The company has also announced a Backbone+ subscription service that integrates Twitch streaming and even enables cable connections for keyboards and more. (You’ll get a free year of the service when buying the controller.) There’s also the ability to join chat groups and lobbies, populated with other Backbone gamers, but it’s not particularly vibrant in comparison to Discord, Reddit or other existing gamer spaces.</p><p></p><p>The app also serves as a games library, of sorts, of all the games you can play with the Backbone One, across Xbox, Stadia, Apple Arcade and individual games in Apple’s App Store. Unfortunately, it’s literally all the compatible games, including unremarkable game clones, and Xbox and Stadia titles you might not even have a subscription for. It’s a shame the app couldn’t interface with which games I’d already installed – which would be impossible for PlayStation Remote Play, admittedly. Tapping the Backbone button during a game will log the title into the library for more convenient access next time, at least. There’s deeper functionality here, but your mileage may vary. It will show recommendations of popular titles, but it’s the incredibly familiar sights of <em>Among Us, Genshin Impact </em>and<em> Minecraft.</em></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10577281-7925-11ec-bdcd-e9fe5ede707a" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Backbone One controller review" data-uuid="e01f2dd7-b395-337c-b999-4152d836ba30"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget/Mat Smith</div></figure><p>The Backbone One is a capable iPhone gamepad, so much in fact that sometimes I actively choose to play Stadia and even remote-play PlayStation when I’m in another room. It is, however, an expensive one. $100 can buy a couple of PS5 controllers, or an entire box of third-party Bluetooth gamepads and smartphone clips.</p><p>But for that price, you get a slick experience that marries well with your iPhone. Over the holidays, when I visited my family, I was able to effortlessly (aside from reading the tiny text) play <em>Deathloop</em> while being hundreds of miles away from my console. Like several existing split gamer pads for smartphones, it’s like a tiny Switch. The app also tries to pool together all your iOS gaming experiences in a single place, which is a nice idea, even if Backbone doesn’t quite nail the execution.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/backbone-one-ios-gamepad-review-143015385.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">868c6867-d0b7-498e-ae23-9183bfb0866a</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:30:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642600735</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:59:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/10577281-7925-11ec-bdcd-e9fe5ede707a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e44f8410-7925-11ec-bcf6-da9b33ed53cc" width="1716" height="1144" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith/ Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Backbone One]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Backbone One]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix's latest mobile games include an open-world card battler]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix is still relatively <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-games-mobile-stranger-things-android-ios-171232076.html">new to mobile gaming</a>, but that isn&#39;t stopping it from quickly releasing new titles. <em>What&#39;s on Netflix</em><a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-launches-two-new-mobile-games-arcanium-rise-of-akhan-and-krispee-street/">notes</a> the streaming service has unveiled two new titles for subscribers.

There are many more budget-friendly robot vacuums available today than there were even just a couple of years ago, and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iRobot&#39;s Roomba 694" href="https://amzn.to/3rwPHX1">iRobot&#39;s Roomba 694</a> is one of the better ones we&#39;ve tried. Normally priced at $274, the affordable robo-vac is even cheaper right now on Amazon where it&#39;s $95 off and down to $179. That&#39;s the same price we saw during the Black Friday shopping season last year, so if you missed the gadget when it was previously on sale, you have another chance to grab it now.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3rwPHX1" id="e4e46e5ceba74cfb90f012066527e62a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba 694 at Amazon - $179</a><p>This is one of iRobot&#39;s entry-level vacuums with a three-button design, mobile app connectivity and the ability to clean both hard and carpeted surfaces well. It earned a spot in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-robot-vacuums-133030847.html">budget robot vacuum guide</a> for those reasons — not only does it do a good job puttering around your home, sucking up dirt and debris along the way, but we also like that you can control it using the on-device buttons or the companion mobile app. iRobot&#39;s app is pretty straightforward, so even if you&#39;re a newbie to the world of autonomous cleaning robots, it shouldn&#39;t be difficult to figure out. The app also lets you set cleaning schedules, which tell the Roomba to automatically clean on certain days of the week and at specific times. The Roomba 694 is also compatible with Alexa and the Google Assistant, so you can control it with voice commands, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Roomba 694 is a great option if you want to introduce a robo-vac into your home without dropping too much money. iRobot also has a number of more advanced machines if you&#39;re looking to invest in a vacuum with more power and smarts. The new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba j7+" href="https://amzn.to/3Gy7JhO">Roomba j7+</a> is on sale for $599 right now, which is $250 off and the best price we&#39;ve seen. It has 10x the suction power of the 694 plus Precision View Navigation with obstacle avoidance, the latter of which is the reason why iRobot dubbed the machine its &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">poop-detecting</a>&quot; robot. It also comes with a clean base, so the robo-vac will automatically empty its bin into that base after every job so you don&#39;t have to.</p><p>Similarly, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Roomba s9+" href="https://amzn.to/3GDnbcA">Roomba s9+</a> is also $250 off and down to $849. It has 40x the suction of a standard Roomba, a design that can more easily clean in room corners and an included clean base. While it&#39;s probably overkill for most people, it&#39;s the model to get if you want one of the highest-end robot vacuums around.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Gy7JhO" id="65c4acf847454d5a8b4a7d2093f4b247" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba j7+ at Amazon - $599</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GDnbcA" id="44ecdeff9f1249feb27819957ab4be7c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Roomba S9+ at Amazon - $849</a><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobots-roomba-694-is-back-down-to-a-record-low-of-179-140530376.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3943a458-f33c-43c8-b2e9-ba37d414b7dc</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:05:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642600730</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:59:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d2ea5e0-7aa1-11eb-9fbf-39d8ed2bf920" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valentina Palladino / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 694]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba 694]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Valorant' will let players mute words they don't want to appear in text chat]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;d rather not mute certain <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valorant-mobile-annoucement-130018738.html"><em>Valorant</em></a> players even though they occasionally make sketchy comments in chat, a new update could solve the problem.

The rules allowed mods a bit more leeway to give warnings and comms bans, or issue game and extended game bans if required. By contrast, the muted words list feature gives the player control, even if it&#39;s just to mute words or phrases you find annoying or repetitive.&nbsp;</p><p>Along with the muted words list, the latest patch boosts the price for the Ares weapon while changing some characteristics. Riot also tweaked Melee to make aiming more reliable, while fixing some bugs around weapons, esports features and performance. Patch 4.01 is now rolling out globally.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valorant-will-let-players-specify-muted-words-they-dont-want-to-appear-in-game-140019569.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee629e27-c31a-4590-a1ff-0221830f91a5</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 14:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642597308</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:02:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/00dbf6e0-7921-11ec-bffb-e479658cde7d" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/00dbf6e0-7921-11ec-bffb-e479658cde7d" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Valorant' will let players mute words they don't want to appear in the game]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Valorant' will let players mute words they don't want to appear in the game]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple now requires verification for education discounts in the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has closed a loophole in the US that allowed buyers to take advantage of its education pricing even if they&#39;re not actually a student or a teacher. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s7g5t6/apple_education_store_now_requires_unidays_and/">noticed</a> by a Redditor, the US Apple Store now <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/19/apple-us-education-store-verification/">requires</a> buyers to verify their status via UNiDAYS to be able to purchase <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">MacBooks</a>, iPads and other devices from its <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/education-pricing">education portal</a>. The tech giant&#39;s education discount typically knocks off 10 percent from a device&#39;s original retail price. It applies to currently enrolled and newly accepted college or university students, as well as teachers and faculty/staff at a school for any grade level.</p><p>The change happened sometime over the past few days, based on snapshots from the Wayback Machine, which don&#39;t show the UNiDAYS verification requirement even in its latest record for January 17th. Prior to this change, Apple doesn&#39;t require its customers in the US to verify their status unlike its stores for other locations such as the UK that have long required UNiDAYS authentication. It didn&#39;t even ask for a .edu email address. The company simply occasionally checks customers at random and then charge the difference to their credit card if it determines that they&#39;re not truly eligible for the education discount.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now, when buyers go to the Apple Education website, they won&#39;t even be able to see the device listings. They&#39;ll have to click through to the <a href="https://www.myunidays.com/US/en-US/partners/appleeducationstore/spotlight/online">UNiDAYS&#39; partner page for Apple</a> first, where they need to sign in or register for verification. Once they&#39;re in, they can buy what they want, so long as it&#39;s within the device limits for the promotion. Buyers can only avail of the discount for one desktop, one Mac mini, one laptop, two iPads and two accessories per year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-requires-verification-education-discounts-us-131255155.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9f78e935-dba8-4cef-b2ca-33b02c5b71cc</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 13:12:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642597976</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T13:13:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/b2eaa1c0-87f5-11ea-b7aa-44fd418b1d98" width="6579" height="4376" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/b2eaa1c0-87f5-11ea-b7aa-44fd418b1d98" width="6579" height="4376" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Felix Zahn via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BERLIN, GERMANY - FEBRUARY 04: Symbol photo.

The aim is to &quot;simplify the Web3 user experience that is often bewildering for mainstream users,&quot; Opera EVP Jorgen Arnensen said in statement.&nbsp;</p><p>A key feature is the built-in non-custodial wallet that will support blockchains including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Celo and Nervos from the get-go. It also announced partnerships with Polygon and others. The idea is to let you access your crypto without the need for any extensions, with the option of using third-party wallets as well. You can purchase cryptocurrencies via a fiat to crypto on-ramp, swap crypto directly in-wallet, send and receive it and check your wallet balance. It even has a secure clipboard that ensures other apps can&#39;t data when you copy/paste.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The other primary function is support for Web3, aka blockchain-based decentralized internet, aka the buzzy new thing among crypto enthusiasts (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-web3-rant-175156845.html">skeptics</a>). On top of providing extra security via blockchain encryption, it allows users to access things like GameFi &quot;where you can earn as you play your way through all sorts of metaverses,&quot; Opera notes. It also offers a &quot;Crypto Corner&quot; with the latest blockchain news that also &quot;lets you grow your Web3 skills,&quot; according to Opera.&nbsp;</p><p>Opera&#39;s rival Mozilla recently announced it would accept cryptocurrency donations, but was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-stops-accepting-crypto-donations-following-outrage-over-climate-impact-131619769.html">hit by a backlash</a> from users including co-founder Jamie Zawinski over the environmental impact of blockchain. Perhaps anticipating a similar reaction, Opera said it was working toward implementing the more energy-efficient Etherium Layer 2 standard &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot;</p><p>Other companies like Ubisoft jumping on the blockchain train with NFTs and other offerings have been hit by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-de-lists-overwhelmingly-disliked-nft-announcement-video/">similar criticism</a>. However, Opera at least gives its users a choice with multiple browser options, as it also offers its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opera-chromebook-browser-070050771.html">regular Opera browser</a> and one that&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-11-opera-built-a-browser-just-for-gamers.html">dedicated to gamers</a>.

However, the new study found that the astronauts&#39; bodies destroyed three million red blood cells per second during six month missions. &quot;We thought we knew about space anemia, and we did not,&quot; said Trudel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A full year after returning to Earth from the ISS, the astronauts&#39; red blood cell levels had not returned to pre-flight levels, according to the study in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01637-7"><em>Nature</em></a>. &quot;If you are on your way to Mars and... can&#39;t keep up&quot; with red blood cell production, &quot;you could be in serious trouble,&quot; said Trudel. That wouldn&#39;t necessarily cause problems in a zero gravity environment, but could become an issue once astronauts arrive on Mars or when they return to Earth.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>[Anemia] is a primary efffect of going to space.</p></blockquote><p>The researchers said that anemia could even be an issue for space tourism, if the potential travelers are at risk for anemia. The study also noted that &quot;current exercise and nutritional countermeasures of modern space travel did not prevent hemolysis and post-flight anemia&quot; with the astronauts tested.&nbsp;</p><p>The study, <a href="https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/1618">first announced in 2016</a>, drew from <a href="https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/1618">data gathered</a> during Expedition 10 and 11 missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2004 and 2005. Anemia is defined as a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, a condition that can result in pallor and weariness and affect endurance and strength.</p><p>The study didn&#39;t say how such issues could be directly resolved, but suggested that doctors focus on anemia-related issues when testing candidates. &quot;Medical screening of future astronauts and space tourists might benefit from a preflight profiling of globin gene and modifiers,&quot; according to the study. It also suggested that post-landing monitoring should cover conditions affected by anemia and hemolysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anemia-could-make-space-travel-to-mars-a-challenge-study-finds-103522230.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a917cb7d-b6ac-4881-8d09-bcfe2a7cd104</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 10:35:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642587219</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T10:13:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6b08be0-7907-11ec-bffd-7cf065a4b8a0" width="2048" height="1363" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6b08be0-7907-11ec-bffd-7cf065a4b8a0" width="2048" height="1363" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anemia could make space travel to Mars a challenge, study finds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anemia could make space travel to Mars a challenge, study finds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US labor board reconsiders rule that allow gag orders in arbitration agreements]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2020, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/arbitration-clauses-requiring-confidentiality-are-ok-nlrb-says">ruled</a> that companies requiring employees to go into arbitration to settle disputes can add a confidentiality clause to the agreement. Now, the agency is rethinking its decision. The NLRB has <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-invites-briefs-on-mandatory-arbitration-clauses">posted</a> an invitation for the public to submit briefs on whether it should adopt a new legal standard to determine if gag orders in mandatory arbitration agreements violate Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, as well as other legal issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Section 8(a)(1) <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1">states</a> that it&#39;s unfair labor practice for employers to &quot;interfere with, restrain or coerce employees&quot; when it comes to exercising their right to self-organization. As <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/labor-board-to-rethink-worker-gag-orders-in-arbitration-pacts"><em>Bloomberg Law</em></a> states, this could lead to arbitration agreements that are more worker-friendly, since the absence of confidentiality clauses means they can talk about their issue publicly and ask help from the appropriate administrative agencies if needed.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Private arbitrations that force workers to keep mum about their issue and the proceedings are a controversial practice. They prevent workers who may be dealing with the same problem to connect, thereby preventing the public and the rest of a company&#39;s workers to see emerging patterns. Companies have landed in hot water for forcing issues like sexual harassment into arbitration in the past, that some have chosen to end the practice. Over 150 Riot Games employees <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-07-riot-games-walk-out-sexism-lawsuits-arbitration.html">staged</a> a walkout after the developer forced the women who filed sexism lawsuits against it into arbitration in 2019. In the same year, Google decided to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-09-google-walkout-response.html"> end forced arbitrations</a> for sexual harassment cases after a walkout involving 20,000 workers. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-sexual-harassment-assault-forced-arbitration-guests-hosts-153010488.html">Airbnb</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-151427460.html">Activision Blizzard</a> are two other companies that decided to stop forced arbitration for sexual harassment cases.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nlrb-reconsiders-rule-gag-orders-arbitration-agreements-095009215.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e3559cc-36b0-488d-bef9-90a2523b322d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 09:50:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642585458</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T09:44:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/50281340-78ff-11ec-b7ef-95f69962ace1" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/50281340-78ff-11ec-b7ef-95f69962ace1" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[gesrey via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The document Arbitration Agreement is ready for signing.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The document Arbitration Agreement is ready for signing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon sued by family of employee killed in Illinois tornado warehouse collapse]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is being sued by the family of delivery driver Austin McEwan who died in the Edwardsville, Illinois warehouse <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-tornado-edwardsville-illinois-deaths-climate-220437155.html">struck by a tornado</a> last month, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/amazon-sued-by-family-of-delivery-driver-killed-inside-collapsed-warehouse/"><em>CNET</em></a> has reported. The lawsuit alleges that Amazon was negligent, citing the fact that it told people to keep working through extreme weather warnings. It also makes claims of negligence against contractors who helped build the warehouse.&nbsp;</p><p>McEwan was one of six people killed when the warehouse roof was hit by a tornado and collapsed. The family of victim Deandre Morrow has also retained a lawyer. &quot;Sadly, it appears that Amazon placed profits first during this holiday season instead of the safety of our son and the other five,&quot; said McEwan&#39;s mother, Alice McKewan in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYl-fRc8M0Q">press conference</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Severe weather watches are common in this part of the country and, while precautions are taken, are not cause for most businesses to close down,&quot; Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel told <em>CNET</em> in a statement. &quot;We believe our team did the right thing as soon as a warning was issued.&quot; The company said that the warehouse was built four years ago in accordance with building code requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>Edwardsville is in a region known as Wind Zone IV, a part of the US most at risk from tornadoes. The National Weather Service <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSStLouis/status/1468877633400180737">warned</a> of a tornado threat 36 hours before they struck, and the morning before the storms, it <a href="https://twitter.com/NWSStLouis/status/1469272060157304833">cautioned</a> of the &quot;likely threat&quot; of &quot;damaging winds in excess of 60 mph.&quot;</p><p>During the same incident, an Amazon dispatcher <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-dispatcher-screenshots-edwardsville-illinois-010215086.html">pressured a driver</a> to deliver packages amid tornado alarms, threatening her with termination. Amazon said that the dispatcher &quot;didn&#39;t follow the standard safety practice&quot; and should have directed the driver to seek shelter. Meanwhile, Democrats have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-warehouse-tornado-democrats-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-153129082.html">pressed Amazon</a> for details on the warehouse deaths, <a href="https://www.warren.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2021.12.20%20Letter%20to%20Amazon%20re.%20Edwardsville,%20IL%20warehouse%20collapse.pdf">saying in a letter</a> that the incident &quot;fit a larger pattern&quot; of Amazon putting safety at risk &quot;in everyday situations and emergencies alike.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-sued-by-family-of-employee-killed-in-warehouse-tornado-collapse-085656743.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">68c9d07d-315e-4553-b949-e939472c1795</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 08:56:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642582616</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T08:57:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Natural Phenomena]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/989d56f0-78fd-11ec-b7f3-fec76fb10c06" width="3300" height="2475" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/989d56f0-78fd-11ec-b7f3-fec76fb10c06" width="3300" height="2475" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lawrence Bryant / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon crew on lifts document the damage from the tornado that hit an Amazon distribution centre where the roof collapsed in Edwardsville, Illinois, U.S. December 13, 2021.

The defendant, Kevin George Aziz Riad, was driving a Model S when he ran a red light and crashed into a Honda Civic at a California intersection in 2019. It ended up killing the Civic&#39;s two passengers, while Riad and his companion sustained non-life threatening injuries. California prosecutors filed two counts of vehicular manslaughter against Riad in October last year.</p><p>The court documents reportedly didn&#39;t mention anything about Autopilot. However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has been investigating the incident over the past couple of years, recently confirmed that it was switched on at the time of the crash. The NHTSA formally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">opened</a> a probe into Tesla&#39;s driver assistance system in August last year following a string of 11 crashes involving parked first responder vehicles that killed 17 people. It&#39;s also investigating other types of crashes with Tesla vehicles, including one <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-investigation-192733573.html">complaint</a> blaming the beta version of the company&#39;s Full Self Driving technology for a collision in California.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>AP</em> notes, Riad is the first to face charges involving a widely used driver assistance technology, but he&#39;s not the very first person using an automated driving system to be charged in the US. In 2020, an Uber backup driver was charged <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-autonomous-crash-negligent-homicide-032513753.html">with negligent homicide</a> after the company&#39;s autonomous test vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. According to an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Uber&#39;s technology detected the victim more than five seconds before the crash but wasn&#39;t able to identify her as a pedestrian. The driver could have avoided the crash if she had been paying attention.&nbsp;</p><p>The NHTSA told <em>AP</em> in a statement that &quot;every vehicle requires the human driver to be in control at all times&quot; even if it has a partially automated system. On its <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot">Autopilot</a> page, Tesla says that Autopilot is &quot;intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-driver-california-crash-first-to-face-felony-charges-autopilot-073720822.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fcfcc27f-f23e-4e92-9ed4-5d5ea01eb8bd</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 07:37:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642577841</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T07:37:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transport Accident]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/d8af3290-4434-11ea-aef6-f9c300a3845f" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/d8af3290-4434-11ea-aef6-f9c300a3845f" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[jetcityimage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Indianapolis - Circa April 2017: Tesla Service Center.

It&#39;s an unambiguous opening salvo in what will likely be a bitter and protracted battle, the playbook for which Lyft and its gig work peers successfully <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/04/tech/california-proposition-22/index.html">tested in California</a> two years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>As the <em>Boston Globe</em><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/18/metro/lyft-makes-largest-one-time-political-donation-massachusetts-history-fueling-gig-worker-ballot-fight/?camp=bg:brief:rss:feedly&amp;rss_id=feedly_rss_brief&amp;utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds">reports</a>, Lyft has thus far contributed the lion&#39;s share of the <a href="https://www.ocpf.us/Filers?q=95481">Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers</a> committee&#39;s $17.2 million war chest, which is intended to fund the forthcoming ballot measure. <a href="https://www.ocpf.us/Filers?q=95481">The rest</a> comes from Uber, DoorDash and Instacart owner Maplebear. The previous record for largest single donation was nearly a third the size: a $5.1 million <a href="https://www.ocpf.us/Filers?q=95471">contribution</a> from General Motors in 2020.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Currently Lyft and Uber are engaged in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/uber-lyft-and-others-propose-gig-work-measure-in-massachusetts?sref=10lNAhZ9">lawsuit</a>, filed by the Attorney General of Massachusetts, which contends that the companies have been misclassifying their driver workforce as contractors. Leveraging contractor status relieves them of many of the costs and obligations associated with employees — such as minimum wage, healthcare and overtime pay — but true contractors typically control how and when they work, and what they charge for their services. Whether or not ridershare drivers actually have that level of autonomy has become a point of legal contention in several of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/12/5/18127208/new-york-uber-lyft-minimum-wage">states</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uber-uk-drivers-workers-not-employees/">countries</a> in which these companies operate.</p><p>California thus far has prosecuted its defense of gig-workers-as-employees most vociferously, first through a state Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/business/economy/gig-economy-ruling.html">ruling</a> in 2018, then through AB5, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/11/california-passes-assembly-bill-5-for-gig-workers.html">successfully-passed bill</a> that (however briefly) enshrined these kinds of drivers as employees. It went into effect on January 1, 2020 and was overturned by ballot measure Proposition 22 that November. Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates dumped a historic $224 million into the proposition — outspending their opposition, which largely consisted of labor unions, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/props-california-2020-election-money/">by more than 10-to-1</a> — the most expensive ballot measure in California history.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Prop 22 was eventually ruled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/prop-22-california-ruling.html">unconstitutional</a>, the strategy has thus far been successful for gig work companies. Legislative changes have been tied up in court, and nowhere in the United States are Lyft or Uber drivers currently entitled to the entire slate of benefits enjoyed by full-time employees.</p><p>In making their case for Prop 22, gig companies essentially employed two lines of attack. The first, against its own workers, was a facile attempt to tie the concept of &quot;flexibility&quot; to contractor status, an utterly false dichotomy perpetuated by the companies themselves. The second was to convince voters in California that the costs associated with a fleet of employee drivers would either force them to scale back service or raise prices.&nbsp;</p><p>After Prop 22 passed, every single company that backed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291580/prop-22-instacart-doordash-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-price-hike">raised prices anyway</a>. Uber&#39;s CEO also recently contended on a call with investors that, in the face of potential employee-status regulations in the European Union, Uber can, in fact, afford to &quot;<a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/01/07/uber-drivers-labor-protections-dara-khosrowshahi-european-union/">make any model work</a>&quot; financially. We&#39;ve reached out to Lyft to ask if it&#39;s in a similar position.</p><p>Given this much publicized bait-and-switch, it seems unlikely the Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers committee will be able to successfully argue the same case regarding cost to consumers. Still, the $17.2 million already amassed has paid for, as the <em>Globe</em> reports, a slew of big-name political consultancies who were behind what is currently the most expensive (and likely to soon the be the second-most expensive) <a href="https://www.ocpf.us/Reports/BallotQuestionReports">ballot measure</a> in Massachusetts history, which sought to stymie a right to repair law.</p><p><strong><em>Are you a gig work driver or courier working in Massachusetts?

Four years on and numerous acquisitions later, the Activision Blizzard deal feels like an extreme escalation of Microsoft’s plans, and it could mark a turning point in the video game industry as a whole, with negative consequences for both players and developers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So far, public reaction to the acquisition <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/s76lrq/log_in_into_your_microsoft_account_to_comment_in/">has been mixed</a>, which makes sense for a few reasons: first, Activision Blizzard&#39;s sheer size is daunting, and this purchase represents more money and industry power than Microsoft&#39;s previous gaming acquisitions combined. Second, Activision Blizzard is currently the subject of multiple investigations into allegations of sexual harassment and gender discrimination at the studio, where CEO Bobby Kotick has been in charge and largely unchecked for the past 30 years. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> is reporting that Kotick is poised to leave the company in a golden parachute once the Microsoft deal goes through.</p><p>This is the first time Microsoft has received a confused response to acquisition news, rather than outright praise, and that&#39;s because this isn&#39;t a standard transaction. It&#39;s the clearest sign yet that we&#39;re in the video game industry&#39;s era of consolidation.</p><p>Back in 2017, Microsoft was badly losing the first-party IP fight to Sony and Nintendo. By the end of that year, Xbox had shut down two of its internal studios, Lionhead and Press Play, it had killed a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-10-cancelling-scalebound-is-a-huge-blow-for-platinumgames.html">hotly anticipated projects</a>, and even with the Xbox Series X right around the corner, there wasn’t much to look forward to in the company’s software reserves. The acquisition announcement at E3 2018 was a sigh of relief for anxious Xbox fans.</p><p>By February 2019, Microsoft had 13 studios and publishing organizations under the banner of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-05-xbox-game-studios-microsoft-rebrand.html">Xbox Game Studios</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/84d94f10-789f-11ec-bbe7-7f995d55bdb4" alt="Xbox acquires Bethesda" data-uuid="a01c7bad-19b2-3927-9c56-38590bf7125f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>And then in September 2020, Microsoft revealed it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-buys-zenimax-bethesda-id-arkane-131006192.html">buying ZeniMax Media</a>, the parent company of Bethesda, id Software, Arkane Studios and Tango Gameworks. The gaming world generally rejoiced, but a few folks also started glancing around, suspicious. These studios were a big deal – the stewards of Fallout, Doom, Dishonored, Wolfenstein, Deathloop, Starfield and Elder Scrolls – and they were being added to Microsoft’s substantial pile of medium-sized companies, more names in a growing list. That alone was cause for pause.</p><p>For most fans, the main question was, what did the acquisition mean for games like <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, which was part of a series that historically hit PlayStation and Xbox platforms alike? Basically, would <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> come to PS4 and PS5?</p><p>Turns out, probably not.</p><p>One year after Microsoft’s purchase of Bethesda, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elder-scrolls-6-xbox-pc-exclusive-game-pass-hint-phil-spencer-172718058.html">Spencer told <em>GQ</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that he believed the Xbox ecosystem was the best place for all of the franchises in the studio’s repertoire, including <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>. He all but confirmed it would be exclusive to Xbox.</p><p>“It’s not about punishing any other platform, like I fundamentally believe all of the platforms can continue to grow,” Spencer told <em>GQ</em>. “But in order to be on Xbox, I want us to be able to bring the full complete package of what we have. And that would be true when I think about <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>. That would be true when I think about any of our franchises.”</p><p><em>Starfield</em>, Bethesda’s sci-fi RPG built for the ninth console generation, will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starfield-xbox-series-x-s-pc-novemeber-11-2022-164701716.html">definitely be exclusive to Xbox Series X/S and PC</a>, skipping PS5 entirely. Spencer’s comments make it clear that Xbox is eyeing exclusivity for its franchises, and after today’s $69 billion deal goes through, that’s going to include Activision Blizzard games.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/99454670-789f-11ec-9fff-9b31fd887ead" alt="Xbox acquires Activision" data-uuid="6136ecfb-9407-32dd-ba3f-7e8f12926755"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Activision Blizzard is the largest third-party publisher in gaming, and it’s the owner of massive franchises including Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Candy Crush. As a third-party studio, Activision Blizzard has been able to negotiate with the main platform holders to get its software on the consoles and devices it wants. This doesn’t always equate to same-day launches or in-game item equity, but generally speaking, this position has helped ensure Activision Blizzard games reach as many players on as many platforms as possible. Exclusivity agreements and distribution deals are the main source of competition in the industry at this point, allowing outside developers to advocate for their games without feeling beholden to any console owner in particular.</p><p>When a platform holder becomes the largest publisher in gaming, it flips the script completely. It jams the script into a shredder, burns the scraps to ash, condenses the ash into stone, and then throws that to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.</p><p>Let’s take Call of Duty, a series with predictable annual installments, for example. Over the years, Activision has shifted allegiances between Microsoft and Sony, offering early access and exclusive game modes to Xbox platforms, then PlayStation, and mixing it up along the way. Among all the backroom talks, bad blood and better offers, it’s always been up to Activision to cut the best deal for Call of Duty, console holders be damned.</p><p>After the acquisition, that negotiation looks entirely different, if it even exists at all. As the owner of Call of Duty, Microsoft can tell Sony to screw off, keeping one of the industry’s biggest franchises exclusive to Xbox platforms.</p><p>This likely won’t happen right away, but it’s certainly a possibility down the line. In his <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/01/18/welcoming-activision-blizzard-to-microsoft-gaming/">blog post</a> about the acquisition, Xbox’s Spencer didn’t address Sony or Nintendo platforms specifically, but he alluded to the possibility of cross-platform support for Activision Blizzard’s franchises.&nbsp;</p><p>“Activision Blizzard games are enjoyed on a variety of platforms and we plan to continue to support those communities moving forward,” he said, without detailing what he meant by “platforms” or “support.” Keep in mind, this was <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elder-scrolls-6-being-xbox-exclusive-is-hard-to-imagine-says-bethesdas-todd-howard/">the messaging</a> around <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> at first, too.</p><p>Microsoft isn’t the only company in the midst of a studio-hoarding spree: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html">Sony</a> picked up its 13th internal studio, Housemarque, in June 2021, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tencent-sumo-acquisition-091425058.html">Tencent</a> is chugging along with ownership of Riot Games, financial stakes in a handful of massive studios, and the purchase of <em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em> developer Sumo Group in July 2021. Even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-21-campo-santo-team-joins-valve.html">Valve</a> has scooped up a handful of independent creators in recent years, including the team behind <em>Firewatch</em> and some members of <em>Kerbal Space Program</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/15526d80-be40-11eb-b2ff-f0a12819cc4b" alt="The crowd and stage for Microsoft Xbox at their press event ahead of the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles on June 9, 2019.

It’s highly likely that there will be more acquisitions by Microsoft, Sony and other major names in gaming, and these deals and subsequent companies will only get bigger with time. With just a few massive studios controlling a huge chunk of the software pipeline, it could instill a sense of homogeneity among new titles, killing innovation as each developer attempts to conform to the corporate environment around them, actively or subconsciously.</p><p>Even with “creative freedom” built into their contracts, the acquired studios will all use the same QA process, funding arrangement, marketing plan, management structure and editing cycle; they’ll have the same bosses and face the same oversight. And when all new products are the result of a singular perspective, they’re bound to feel familiar. Stale, even. Boring.</p><p>Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard is an escalation of the exclusivity scheme, and it represents a new way of doing business. Now and for years to come, consolidation is the name of the game.</p><p>Maybe one day we’ll get <em>Consolidation 2: Blow It All Up And Make Everything Indie Again</em>, but that one might have trouble finding a publisher.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-consolidation-exclusives-222028443.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5265900f-a494-4f29-a3da-ed17942dfe3b</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 22:20:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642544428</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T06:24:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4599e710-789f-11ec-9f1d-2d38d97066c2" width="4463" height="2975" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4599e710-789f-11ec-9f1d-2d38d97066c2" width="4463" height="2975" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Christian Petersen via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - JUNE 10:  Phil Spencer, Executive President of Gaming at Microsoft, speaks during the Microsoft xBox E3 briefing at the Microsoft Theater on June 10, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.

According to<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/apple-says-antitrust-bills-increase-risk-of-iphone-security-breaches.html"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a>, Apple recently told lawmakers the legislation would make iPhone users less safe.</p><p>“The bills put consumers in harm’s way because of the real risk of privacy and security breaches,” Apple said in a letter seen by <em>CNBC</em>. The company specifically targets app sideloading as a potential threat. One of the provisions of the Open App Markets Act would force platform holders to allow consumers to sideload software and install third-party app stores. “But, if Apple is forced to enable sideloading, millions of Americans will likely suffer malware attacks on their phones that would otherwise have been stopped,” the company states in the letter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On Tuesday, Google, in a <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/the-harmful-consequences-of-congresss-anti-tech-bills/"><ins>post</ins></a> attributed to Kent Walker, the company’s president of global affairs and chief legal officer, advanced a similar argument. “Google is able to protect billions of people around the world from cyberattacks because we bake security and privacy protections into our services,” he said.</p><p>Walker warns the bills could hurt the company’s ability to integrate automated security features in its services. He also claims the bills could hurt the company’s ability and that of its US counterparts to compete with foreign firms by forcing them to obtain approval from “government bureaucrats” whenever they plan to release new features or address existing issues.</p><p>Apple and Google may not like the proposed bills, but they have support from others in the tech ecosystem. Specifically, the Coalition for App Fairness, an organization <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-spotify-and-others-form-alliance-against-app-store-dominance-135026221.html"><ins>Epic and Spotify</ins></a> co-founded to pressure the two companies to change their app store policies, has come out in support of the legislation. “Moving this important legislation forward sends a clear and unambiguous message that monopoly control of the app ecosystem is no longer acceptable,” the group said on Monday.</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee will <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/01/14/2022/executive-business-meeting"><ins>discuss both bills on Thursday</ins></a>, at which point they could advance to the floor of the Senate. At that point, the Senate would need to make time to vote on the legislation. That’s something that could take time with all the other issues it needs to consider in the coming weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-google-antitrust-bills-opposition-220354732.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a5f3a37f-1fc9-458c-b0ef-8e39be97901e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 22:03:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642543435</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T22:04:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1a0ed020-78a8-11ec-ad66-48cfb1f49e82" width="5306" height="3537" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1a0ed020-78a8-11ec-ad66-48cfb1f49e82" width="5306" height="3537" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brooks Kraft via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook testifies at a Senate homeland security and governmental affairs investigations subcommittee hearing on offshore profit shifting and the U.S. tax code, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

While the change won’t prevent adults and teens from connecting at all, it could make it more difficult for strangers to find teens they don’t already know. In a blog post, the company said the change was part of its work to &quot;combat the fentanyl epidemic&quot; and keep drug dealers from finding &quot;new ways to abuse Snapchat.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has faced scrutiny over its handling of drug dealers on its platform in recent months.

The Citizen Lab, a research facility based at the University of Toronto&#39;s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, said a &quot;simple but devastating flaw&quot; made it easy to bypass encryption systems that are supposed to protect voice audio and file transfers.</p><p>&quot;The worst case scenario is that someone is intercepting all the traffic and recording all the passport details, all the medical details,&quot; research associate Jeffrey Knockel told <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/china-s-olympic-app-contains-simple-but-devastating-flaw-1.5744221"><em><ins>CTV</ins></em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The app is used for health monitoring as part of COVID-19 countermeasures. Other features include messaging, news about the Games and information about logistics. The International Olympic Committee says the local Beijing 2022 workforce is using the app for things like time-keeping and task management too.</p><p>&quot;The IOC has conducted independent third-party assessments on the application from two cyber-security testing organizations,&quot; the IOC told Engadget in a statement. &quot;These reports confirmed that there are no critical vulnerabilities.&quot; The IOC noted that instead of using the mobile app, attendees can access a web-based health monitoring system. It said it has requested the researchers&#39; report &quot;to understand their concerns better.&quot;</p><p>The Citizen Lab notes that health customs forms containing passport information and travel and medical history are also at risk. In addition, the researchers said it was possible to spoof server responses, which could let hackers provide fake instructions to users.</p><p>Along with determining that the app doesn&#39;t encrypt some data transmissions, the team found that the app fails to validate some SSL certificates. In such cases, the app can&#39;t &quot;validate to whom it is sending sensitive, encrypted data.&quot; Although they were only able to create an account on the iOS app, the researchers believe the vulnerabilities exist on the Android version of MY2022 as well.</p><p>The Citizen Lab said it informed the organizing committee for the Games about the issues on December 3rd, and said it had 15 days to respond and 45 days to fix the issues before it published its findings. As of Tuesday, the researchers hadn&#39;t received a reply.</p><p>An updated iOS version of the app that was released on Sunday didn&#39;t solve the problems. According to the researchers, the developers added a feature called “Green Health Code” that asks for more travel and medical history details, which are also vulnerable to the SSL certification issue.</p><p>According to the researchers, the flaws could mean that the app contravenes Apple&#39;s App Store rules and Google’s Unwanted Software Policy. In addition, MY2022 may be violating China&#39;s privacy standards and laws.</p><p>In addition, The Citizen Lab noted that the app includes an option to report “politically sensitive” content. It has a list of 2,442 censorship keywords too, which is said to be inactive at the minute, but includes terms related to topics like Xinjiang, Tibet, Chinese government agencies and other socially sensitive matters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/olympics-app-my2022-security-privacy-ioc-201935413.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">de2db631-f679-40dc-b87f-40c9a848396e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 20:19:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642537176</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T20:19:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/20162930-789b-11ec-9de7-ce114879684d" width="5216" height="3477" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/20162930-789b-11ec-9de7-ce114879684d" width="5216" height="3477" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carlos Garcia Rawlins / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman walks past the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic logo at an installation featuring National Speed Skating Oval, in Beijing, China January 18, 2022.
