But one of the most unique things about it is definitely the patching matrix. It&#39;s a digital reimagining of the pin-based patching system found on classic the classic <a href="https://www.engadget.com/soulwax-ems-synthi-100-deewee-sessions-143007711.html">EMS Synthi</a>. People were apparently so enamored with the matrix that the company is now offering it as a standalone product called the Matrix Mixer.</p><p>As you&#39;d expect the Matrix Mixer is, a mixer. It has 16 3.5mm ins and 16 3.5mm outs along the X and Y axes which you can use to combine either audio or control voltage signals.  The actual interface for combining them is the same as the SYNTRX: a 16x16 grid of LEDs that you navigate using a pair of knobs just like you were drawing on an Etch A Sketch. Pressing down on the encoders enables a connection, and then you can cycle through different levels of attenuation, from 100-, to 70- and then 30-percent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This makes it quick and easy to connect a bunch of different modules and synths without a rats nest of cables. You can even connect multiple sources or destination to the same patch point without special stacking cables.</p><p>Before this desktop version of the Matrix Mixer, and even before the SYNTRX, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/erica-synths-pico-system-iii-modular-synthesizer-review-130001111.html">Erica Synths</a> made a Eurorack Module called the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo_KviHAyh8">Matrix Mixer</a>. The core idea was the same, but it had less inputs and outputs, relied on a tiny touchscreen for controls and was limited to Eurorack connections. This new version easily integrates other sources like a guitar or synthesizer using the 1/4-inch in and outs on the back. You can even patch a Buchla Music Easel in using special adapter cards.</p><p>The Matrix Mixer can even store presets, allowing you to quickly recall particular patches, though you will have to manually set all the parameters on your modules.&nbsp;</p><p>Erica Synths has brought one of the best features of the SYNTRX to a wider audience and expanded it flexibility. But, it doesn&#39;t come cheap. It&#39;s currently available for preorder for €490 or $599 and is expected to star shipping on July 26.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/erica-synths-syntrx-matrix-mixer-modular-synth-setup-170346218.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f1863eec-ff2e-4075-806b-5d1b3d9e7883</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 17:03:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627061031</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T17:24:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e8583d0-ebd4-11eb-87fb-4c36d4fca0dd" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e8583d0-ebd4-11eb-87fb-4c36d4fca0dd" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrey Nikiforov]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Erica Synths Matrix Mixer]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Erica Synths Matrix Mixer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook’s cloud gaming service hits iOS devices as a web app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has become the latest company to offer a cloud gaming service on iOS, only once again you won&#39;t access it through the App Store. Starting today, you can visit the <a href="http://www.fb.gg/play">Facebook Gaming website</a> to add a Progressive Web App (PWA) that acts as a shortcut to the service on your iPhone or iPad. To do so, visit the platform&#39;s website and tap the &quot;Add to Home Screen&quot; option from the Safari share sheet.</p><p>It&#39;s not an elegant solution, but it&#39;s the same one employed by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/luna-amazon-cloud-gaming-interview-pwa-apple-173948922.html">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-could-gaming-ios-web-215045999.html">Microsoft</a>. When Apple tweaked its guidelines last September to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-google-stadia-xcloud-microsoft-171436934.html">allow for cloud gaming clients</a> on iOS, it said games offered in a streaming service had to be individually downloaded from the App Store. That&#39;s a requirement both Microsoft and Facebook said was not congruent with how every other platform treats cloud gaming services.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We&#39;ve come to the same conclusion as others: web apps are the only option for streaming cloud games on iOS at the moment,&quot; Vivek Sharma, Facebook&#39;s vice-president of gaming, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22589398/facebook-cloud-gaming-web-app-launch-apple">told <em>The Verge</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>of today&#39;s launch. &quot;As many have pointed out, Apple&#39;s policy to &#39;allow&#39; cloud games on the App Store doesn&#39;t allow for much at all. Apple&#39;s requirement for each cloud game to have its own page, go through review and appear in search listings defeats the purpose of cloud gaming.&quot;</p><p>The process of adding the web app is complicated enough that Facebook includes a short how-to when you first visit its Gaming website on Safari. You also have to know to navigate to the company&#39;s website in the first place. The reason for that is the App Store guidelines prohibit developers from using their applications to direct individuals to websites that feature alternative payment systems to those offered by Apple, and you pay for the in-game purchases offered in Facebook Gaming titles through Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-pay-online-stores-121041167.html">Pay platform</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-gaming-ios-pwa-163440977.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">46ded07f-7842-464e-b1fb-c01933b6715a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 16:34:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627073258</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T20:47:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0443ef80-ebd3-11eb-9df4-6ff4fb476f16" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0443ef80-ebd3-11eb-9df4-6ff4fb476f16" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Igor Bonifacic / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Gaming]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Gaming]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Eargo's in-app test transforms its next-gen hearing aids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Eargo recently announced its latest smart hearing aid — the Eargo 5. We don’t do a <em>lot</em> of hearing aid news here at Engadget, but the California-based company makes some of the most &quot;gadgety&quot; we’ve tried and the latest model certainly appears to continue that trend.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-09-eargo-neo-hifi-hands-on.html">Neo HiFi</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-10-eargo-neo-hearing-aid-hands-on.html">Neo </a>before it, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Eargo 5" href="https://fave.co/2V5Egcq">Eargo 5</a> is a tiny, &quot;invisible&quot; (completely in the canal, or CIC) hearing aid that comes with a charging case. With older Eargos, that case doubled as a way to connect the “buds” to your phone. Unfortunately, that meant the buds had to be in it while they were updated. What’s new this time around is that you can perform profile changes and more while actually wearing the hearing aids. What&#39;s more, there are key new features that change how the hearing aids <em>sound</em>. It’s an exciting update for fans of the brand as it adds to Eargo’s already slick user experience, something sorely lacking in many of the mainstream brands you find at your local audiologists.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The most interesting new feature is “Sound Match.&quot; Hearing aids have long had different profiles, and will usually be tuned for your own needs by an audiologist, but Eargo’s direct-to-consumer (and the need for the buds to be in the case) approach has made this much-needed personalization difficult. Until now?</p><p>Sound Match is effectively a hearing test built-in to the Eargo app. Once you pair the case (via Bluetooth) you can remove the Eargo 5s and the app will walk you through the test. If you’ve ever completed a hearing test, you’ll be familiar with this one. The app plays a series of sounds and you tell it if you can hear it or not; at the end, you’ll be presented with the results for each ear.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b518a170-eb0b-11eb-be67-3523bdbfb58f" alt="Eargo 5." data-uuid="cef96560-4a66-3d0a-adbb-6a89bf1eb1b4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As simple as this is, my initial experiences with it weren’t entirely smooth. Not least because it took a few tries (and some back and forth with Eargo) to even get the case to pair with the app. After trying several restarts and installations, I was able to get connected and access the test — most likely due to me having early hardware.</p><p>From then on the test was mostly straightforward, until I spotted there was a “replay” button. I noticed that sometimes when I didn’t initially hear a sound, I definitely heard it after tapping replay. As in, it was audible enough that I wouldn’t have missed it the first time around. This meant I had to re-do the test to make sure I hadn’t incorrectly tapped “No” when really the sound just didn’t play at all.</p><p>Minor hiccups aside, once I was confident I had completed the test properly, I could further customize the experience by changing what profiles are available on the device. There are six situational ones (restaurant/meeting etc) and four presets. You can store a total of four on the hearing aids themselves.</p><p>Previous Eargo models would simply tell you the number of the audio profile that is active as you switch through the four on offer (via a double-tap on your tragus). With the Eargo 5 it now tells you the name of that profile if you chose one of the &quot;situational&quot; ones to eliminate any guesswork. You can also further tweak these profiles in the app, or simply change the volume and noise reduction (there’s now noise reduction here too I should mention) without having to permanently change the profile. This includes adjusting the volume and the treble/bass.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b4e5e060-eb05-11eb-ad8e-d7212eb07c0f" alt="Eargo 5 smart hearing aid." data-uuid="dd2cb7e0-8d88-3664-b4a9-48cfa8511673"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Although you can now adjust the sound and profiles while actually wearing the Eargo (before, you had to take them out and plop them in the case, which is less than ideal), there’s no capability for music/audio streaming from your phone. Eargo uses ultrasonic commands to communicate between the case and the hearing aids. That’s a neat way to enable small updates, but not enough for anything more heavyweight. Remember, size is key here, and streaming on devices this small, that go fully in your ear, isn’t a simple thing to do.</p><p>This new customization functionality really does improve the Eargo experience. I have tried several different devices and the ones that best serve my hearing loss are, predictably, the ones that have been tuned by an audiologist. This meant that, while older Eargos were some of the most appealing in terms of user experience and fit, they weren’t quite suitable for my personal situation and only provided users with limited tools to adjust the sound to their needs.</p><p>With the Eargo 5, I find them much more assistive in my hearing, particularly on the side I have problems with. In fact, I personally prefer just wearing only one, as my hearing loss is unilateral and having a boost on the &quot;good&quot; side can feel a bit much. I also find wearing both a bit less comfortable. There’s no logical reason why wearing one for extended periods should be fine, but two isn’t, but I think the combination of too much &quot;extra&quot; hearing (on my good side) and the physical feeling of something in both ears is just a lot of sensory stimulation, for me at least. Obviously, if you have a bilateral hearing deficiency you’ll want all the assistance you can get.</p><p>If you own a pair of older Eargos and were wondering if the hearing test feature might come to your model via an update, sadly it&#39;s not possible. There&#39;s specific hardware here to enable the ultrasonic commands, that isn&#39;t present in previous models.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/272cadb0-eb07-11eb-84ed-91ec0e3caa0b" alt="Eargo 5 smart hearing aid." data-uuid="2e19d548-89d0-33db-af09-3b8285a6599b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Beyond Sound Match, Eargo claims the sound has been redesigned from the ground up for “optimal audio and speech performance.” The company doesn’t elaborate further but, with the new customization feature, it’s fair to say this is a very different experience than previous models already so any other improvements are hard to pick out, but good to know they are there.</p><p>Beyond the core updates, there are some welcome usability tweaks, too. The charging case now has lights around where the hearing aids should be placed to help you correctly seat them at night. Those lights also provide feedback by changing color when there’s a software update or the aids aren’t charging properly. You’ll also no longer need to make sure the contacts on the buds meet the ones in the case. A new magnetic inductive charging system means they will click themselves into the right position automatically.</p><p>While Eargo&#39;s app remains a slick experience, there are a few small opportunities to improve it further. The volume control is nice and simple, and you can choose to boost either side individually, or both as a pair. What’s lacking is visual feedback or even a tone in your ear, to let you know when you’ve reached the top or bottom of the range. There’s also no indication of whether any changes you make to a profile are permanently saved or an obvious way to reset them to default, but these are minor UI issues.</p><p>Battery life is claimed to be around 16 hours per charge. Add to that the battery in the case and this means you won’t need to plug them in for a couple of days, which is handy for weekends away where you don’t want to have to worry about finding an outlet. Should you need to, though, the charger is USB-C, so likely something you already have for your phone or laptop (a cable is, of course, included).</p><p>All in all, it&#39;s a substantial update for a direct-to-consumer product. Eargo has been getting a lot of things right in terms of making its products user-friendly and appealing to a mass audience. This matters when it&#39;s estimated that<a href="https://www.hearingloss.org/wp-content/uploads/HLAA_HearingLoss_Facts_Statistics.pdf?pdf=FactStats"> over 40 million Americans</a> could benefit from an assistive hearing device. What was lacking, until now that is, was a way to tune them to your specific needs. Which in the world of hearing loss, can be the difference between understanding the television a bit better and being able to pick out quieter sounds in a noisy environment. The latter is something that makes daily life feel a lot more natural and makes social situations much more comfortable, so it&#39;s something really valuable to have on a device this small.</p><p>Remember, though, hearing aids are not a cheap product category. A good pair will often run you a couple of thousand dollars, more if you want something bespoke. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Eargo 5" href="https://fave.co/2V5Egcq">Eargo 5</a>, then, at $2,950 might seem steep compared to a pair of wireless headphones but is relatively affordable among its hearing aid peers. If you’re already an Eargo user looking to upgrade, there’s a “repeat customer discount” that can shave off $500 from the MSRP.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eargos-latest-smart-hearing-aids-bring-a-much-needed-hearing-test-160001810.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">589bab0f-6bfb-4b7a-aafa-55c0b4a479d0</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 16:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627058052</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T16:34:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/57a480c0-eb03-11eb-afdf-aba7829f60e1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/57a480c0-eb03-11eb-afdf-aba7829f60e1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Eargo 5 smart hearing aid.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Eargo 5 smart hearing aid]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[This week's best deals: $100 off Apple's iPad Air and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A bunch of gadgets went on sale this week, from Apple products to streaming devices.

The company says it plans to replace defective batteries, but until it can do so it&#39;s advising Bolt customers to limit their charging up to 90 percent, and not to go below 70 miles of range. It&#39;s also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-fire-warning-215322969.html">reiterating a recommendation from last week</a> against parking indoors and leaving the car&#39;s to charge overnight unattended. This latest recall follows a similar one from last November, where <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-chevy-bolt-over-battery-fire-reports-230044311.html">GM recalled more than 68,000 Bolts</a>.</p><p>The company also suggests that Bolt customers visit their nearest Chevy EV dealer to get the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-battery-recall-software-195939173.html">advanced diagnostics software</a>, which should alert them ahead of any future battery issues.

If for no other reason than that, you should take care of it. Not only will it last for longer, but it will also work better over the time that you keep it. In this how-to, we&#39;ll share some tips on how to take care of your PC. Of course, it&#39;s impossible to cover this topic from every angle, so think of this guide as an introduction more than anything else.</p><h2>How to clean your computer and peripherals</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8e767410-e8be-11eb-9fda-568912cc3572" alt="Back to School cleaning products" data-uuid="a3522e82-6274-3e1d-9c04-8910539a0b32"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Windows PCs, especially desktops, come in various shapes and sizes, but the tips we&#39;re about to go through here will help you clean your computer whether you bought it prebuilt or put together yourself. If you own a laptop, look at our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-your-mac-macbook-cleaning-supplies-digital-organization-153007592.html">recent Mac organization guide</a>. All the steps we detail there will work just as well for a Windows portable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before cleaning the inside of your computer, start with your display and peripherals. At this stage, all you&#39;ll need is some distilled water in a spray bottle and a microfiber cloth. You can buy the former at a grocery store or <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Make-Distilled-Water">make it yourself</a>. And if you don&#39;t already own any microfiber cloths, Amazon sells <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:affordable 24-packs" href="https://amzn.to/2UPa6dg">affordable 24-packs</a> you can get for about $15. Once you have those in hand, spray the water onto a clean cloth and wipe down your computer&#39;s display before moving to the mouse and keyboard. You want to start with your screen to avoid transferring dirt and residue to the panel.</p><p>It’s possible to write an entirely separate guide on how to clean keyboards, but the short version is you&#39;ll want to pick up a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:keycap puller" href="https://amzn.to/3ybkVot">keycap puller</a> and use that to give you unobstructed access to any debris and gunk that has been building up under your keys. If the keycaps have a lot of dirt and residue on them, your best option is to soak them in warm water and use a toothbrush to scrub away the buildup. Give them plenty of time to dry before reinstalling them on your keyboard.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8e74c660-e8be-11eb-97ff-7defcb2a8b1e" alt="Back to School cleaning products" data-uuid="b898c8c3-89fd-3894-9b89-40f4fb907dba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Once you’re done with those, turn off your PC and unplug everything that&#39;s connected to it. You&#39;ll also want to switch off the power supply unit (PSU) by flipping the toggle on its outside to the &quot;O&quot; position. Next, push down on the power button a couple of times to discharge any static electricity that you might be carrying around.</p><p>If at all possible, do most of the steps we&#39;re about to describe outside. The last thing you want to do is go through the trouble of cleaning your computer and then let it pull in all that dust again.</p><p>Once you&#39;ve moved your computer, start by removing the side panels. Most modern cases allow you to do this without any tools, but you&#39;ll need at least one screwdriver for most of the work we&#39;ll detail in a moment. When it comes to most screws inside your computer, a 4-inch Phillips screwdriver should be all you need. Some components, such as your GPU, may include Torx screws and the like, but don&#39;t worry about those for now since we won&#39;t be taking them apart. If you don&#39;t already own a decent set of screwdrivers and have something of a DIY streak in you, a driver kit from iFixit is your best bet. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:16" href="https://amzn.to/3ybkTgl">16</a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:32" href="https://amzn.to/3h3REWK">32</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:62-bit kits" href="https://amzn.to/3jrd4Pu">62-bit kits</a> it sells are an excellent starting point, and they&#39;ll come in handy with more than just your computer.</p><p>If your PC has any dust filters, remove those now and give them a rinse at the sink before setting them aside to dry. Depending on how long your computer has been collecting dust, you may want to remove some components such as the GPU to make it easier to clean everything. If that&#39;s something you feel comfortable doing and it&#39;s your first time removing any of the internals, use your phone to take photos of the interior. The images will help you put all the parts in their original place at the end. That&#39;s important to do since there&#39;s an optimal way to install many of the components in your computer. For instance, you always want to install your GPU in the fastest available PCIe lane. When it comes to removing any PCI cards, first unscrew its mounting bracket and then push the corresponding release on your motherboard before pulling the card out.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8e751480-e8be-11eb-a6fb-18fd90064826" alt="Back to School cleaning products" data-uuid="ac3dc9f8-b9c6-3b8a-9291-c0b88ca4b4ca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>Whether you decide to keep all your computer&#39;s internals in place or not, you&#39;ll need something to blow all that dust away. A can of compressed air is one option, but I like to use a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Giottos Rocket Blower" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000L9OIQC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=giftguide2021-20&amp;language=en_US">Giottos Rocket Blower</a>. It was designed for cleaning camera sensors and won&#39;t damage any of your components. It&#39;s also a one-time purchase. Whatever you have at hand, use it to blow away the dust that&#39;s been building up on your computer&#39;s internal components, fans and grills. Pay special attention to the heatsinks attached to your PC’s CPU, GPU, chipset and voltage regulators. They will likely have most of the hardest to remove dust in your system thanks to their tight fin stacks. What’s more, especially bad buildup can make them ineffective at cooling those components, which will, in turn, affect their performance.</p><p>When cleaning any exposed PCB, use an antistatic brush (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:like this one from Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3AlMQ70">like this one from OXO</a>) instead of a microfiber cloth. You&#39;ll avoid damaging any of the sensitive components on the board. You can go over any non-electronic part with a dampened microfiber cloth.</p><p>At this point, all you need to do is put everything back in its place. As one final tip, if there&#39;s any way you can avoid leaving your desktop on the floor, you&#39;ll end up spending less time cleaning it since it won&#39;t be near all the dust and dander that collects there. If your desk setup or living space makes that not an option, a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:PC tower stand" href="https://amzn.to/3wv1h5w">PC tower stand</a> is a cheap but effective way to elevate your computer off the ground and help it pull in less debris.</p><h2>How to organize your PC’s storage drives</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9a356400-e95e-11eb-bdd5-ebb6c90f1cb8" alt="CleanMyPC" data-uuid="f719834d-dced-3287-8b20-d0197dfcc9b2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">MacPaw</div></figure><p>If it&#39;s been a while since you&#39;ve done an audit of all the software you have installed on your computer, the best place to start is in the Task Manager. It&#39;s here you can see how much of its resources your computer is devoting to specific processes. Since everyone will have different software installed on their PC, it&#39;s hard to offer blanket recommendations, but using the Task Manager you can get a sense of the apps that may be slowing down your computer. For most people, there will be two main culprits: bloatware and antivirus software.</p><p>If you bought your PC from a system integrator like Dell, it will almost certainly include software your computer doesn&#39;t need to operate. So you can safely uninstall those apps to improve performance and save on space.</p><p>This next tip may be contentious for some, but I believe as long as you avoid clicking on sketchy links and stay away from the dark corners of the internet, Windows Defender is all you need to protect your computer from the majority of malware that&#39;s out there. While there are good antivirus programs like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Bitdefender" href="https://fave.co/3y93LYf">Bitdefender</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Malwarebytes" href="https://fave.co/3hfeM3D">Malwarebytes</a>, the majority cost far too much for what they offer and will only slow down your computer. If you don&#39;t feel comfortable uninstalling your antivirus software, then by all means, leave it on your computer.</p><p>While you&#39;re in the task manager, you&#39;ll also want to click on the &quot;Startup&quot; tab to see what programs your computer is launching when you power it on. You can speed up that process simply by limiting that list to as few apps as possible. As for the actual process of deleting any software you don&#39;t need, always uninstall programs from the Control Panel as this will leave the fewest leftovers when everything is said and done. If you&#39;ve used Windows for a while, you&#39;ll have errant files, folders and registry entries all over the place. It&#39;s possible to cull those manually, but doing so can be time-consuming. So we recommend using a program like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Iolo System Mechanic" href="https://bit.ly/3jmG3nr">Iolo System Mechanic</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:CleanMy PC" href="https://fave.co/3dqhDWu">CleanMy PC</a> to complete a deep clean of your system.</p><p>If you have any mechanical drives installed in your computer, it&#39;s good to get into the habit of defragging them regularly. First, launch the built-in Defragment and Optimize Drives app and click the &quot;Optimize&quot; button. Depending on the size of your hard drive, this process may take a while. Don&#39;t defrag your SSDs, as you&#39;ll only shorten their lifespan for little to no performance improvement.</p><h2>How to organize your apps, tabs and other windows</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/99bd5860-e95f-11eb-b7df-13ff2efddd51" alt="Melbourne, Australia - Jun 13, 2016: Clicking the Windows Store icon on Surface Pro 4. It is an app store for Microsoft Windows, allowing users to download apps, ,games, music, movies and TV shows." data-uuid="797e7fa4-1a62-3b1b-b0bb-2951b3eeabef"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ymgerman via Getty Images</div></figure><p>Say what you will about Windows 10, but the fact is it comes with some of the best window management tools built right into an operating system. You don&#39;t need to download any additional software to organize your desktop, but there are some settings you can tweak to get even more out of its signature Snap functionality.</p><p>As you may already know, you can press the Windows and Tab keys at the same time to bring up the Task View pane. It&#39;s here that you can add additional virtual desktops. If you&#39;re not already using virtual desktops, they&#39;re great for organizing your active windows so that you don&#39;t have to constantly rearrange them when you&#39;re trying to find a specific one. You can quickly press the Windows key, Ctrl and either the left or right arrow keys to move between desktops. But to make things even simpler, head to the Settings app and into the Multitasking section of the System menu. Under the &quot;Virtual desktops&quot; heading, switch both settings to &quot;All desktops.&quot; You can now use the Alt-Tab shortcut or taskbar to switch to any app on any desktop.</p><p>When it comes to wrangling your tabs, a lot of that will depend on the browser you use. But as a decent starting point, all the most popular ones include a feature that allows you to pin tabs. I use this to keep the websites I visit most frequently throughout a workday (in my case, Gmail, Trello and Google Drive) open at all times and at the top of my tab bar. In that way, those tabs never get lost among the countless other websites I might have open for a story I&#39;m writing. What&#39;s more, in the case of Brave, the browser I use, I can use a handful of keyboard shortcuts to jump to those tabs quickly.</p><p>In closing, we want to highlight just how much customization Windows 10 offers you when it comes to the organization of your computer. As just one example, you can right-click on items located on the taskbar and start menu to put the apps and shortcuts you use most frequently within easy reach. However, if you want to really dig into all the options Windows 10 offers on that front, websites like <em>Windows Central </em>have <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/tips-tricks-increase-pc-performance-windows-10">detailed how-tos</a> that are an excellent starting point.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-clean-and-organize-your-windows-pc-150026502.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fa3d81a5-f2b4-490f-ba8c-49e12192bab0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 15:10:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627051994</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T14:53:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1bee3b80-e8be-11eb-b3d2-f5e27ac6791e" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1bee3b80-e8be-11eb-b3d2-f5e27ac6791e" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Will Lipman Photography for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A wireless keyboard is being cleaned by a brush with clothes scatter in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[How to clean your PC]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Best Buy's 'Black Friday in July' sale knocks hundreds off OLED TVs from Sony, LG]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While it&#39;s a bit early to be thinking about the holidays, retailers jump on the opportunity to remind us that we&#39;re six months out from the festivities.

The company has <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/how-were-introducing-womens-football-football-manager">revealed</a> that it&#39;s adding women&#39;s soccer (aka football) to its management sim. This will likely be a &quot;multi-year&quot; project, SI warned, but this also isn&#39;t a simple character model swap. The studio wants to offer the same kind of depth it has for men&#39;s sport while accounting for the differences between players and leagues.</p><p>There will be new models and databases, of course. However, SI noted that it also has to account for different league rules, gender differences in text translations (the most expensive part of the project) and tweaks to different player attribute systems. The company also has to decide whether or not it accounts for certain practical realities of women&#39;s soccer, at least at first — does it factor in menstruation and pregnancy, for example?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The team recently hired coach and research expert Tina Keech to lead its women&#39;s soccer efforts, and there are already motion capture sessions underway.</p><p>The expansion will likely prove costly. SI expects adding women will &quot;cost millions,&quot; and it&#39;s looking for sponsorship deals that could help fund the project. However, the company believes there&#39;s a moral imperative to add women to the game — it wants to &quot;smash&quot; the glass ceiling for women&#39;s soccer and help it get the same attention given to men&#39;s leagues. In other words, <em>Football Manager</em> will be part of a larger sports equality campaign that includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-11-ea-sports-women-in-games.html">games like <em>FIFA</em></a> as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-05-fox-sports-fifa-womens-world-cup-2019-4k-streaming.html">better TV coverage</a> of real-world matches.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/football-manager-womens-soccer-145306757.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c41697dc-d248-4144-9e1d-ee074df00a60</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 14:53:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627050804</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T14:33:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/07fc7030-ebbe-11eb-bc6b-e96871405d36" width="3021" height="2053" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/07fc7030-ebbe-11eb-bc6b-e96871405d36" width="3021" height="2053" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Benoit Tessier / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Soccer Football - Women's Champions League - Round of 16 First Leg - Paris St Germain v Sparta Prague - Georges Lefevre Stadium, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France - March 9, 2021  Paris St Germain's Luana in action with Sparta Prague's Eliska Sonntagova and Lucie Martinkova  REUTERS/Benoit Tessier]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SOCCER-CHAMPIONS-PSG-SPP/REPORT]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Google Pixel 4 is on sale for $380 at Woot]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve been on the hunt for a capable Android phone that won&#39;t break the bank, there&#39;s a solid deal over at Woot that&#39;s worth checking out. Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras.html">Pixel 4</a> is on sale for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$380" href="https://fave.co/36TtJnh">$380</a>, down from the usual $800 for the 64GB model. It&#39;s the lowest price we&#39;ve seen for the smartphone in quite some time. Woot&#39;s parent company Amazon and B&amp;H Photo were both selling the Pixel 4 for $400 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-4-sale-amazon-bh-131509963.html">earlier this month</a>.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Pixel 4 (64GB) at Woot - $380" href="https://fave.co/36TtJnh">Buy Pixel 4 (64GB) at Woot - $380</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you might expect from a Google smartphone, the Pixel 4 has great cameras. It has a &quot;smooth&quot; display system that can boost the refresh rate from the typical 60Hz to 90Hz. The device will also support <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-hands-on-181528378.html">Android 12</a> and it&#39;s quick enough for most use cases.</p><p>Overall, the Pixel 4 might be better value than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-samples-specs-price-150053038.html">Pixel 4a 5G</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">Pixel 5</a> right now. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-samples-specs-price-150053038.html">Pixel 4a</a>, meanwhile, costs $350 and arrived a year after the Pixel 4, but Google downgraded some of the specs — the display only has a 60Hz refresh rate and there&#39;s just a single rear camera, rather than two.</p><p>There are a few provisos to bear in mind with the Pixel 4. Google will provide Android and security updates for the Pixel 4 <a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones">until October 2022</a>, but there&#39;s no guarantee it will continue to do so after that time. Phone and online support might not be available after then either. Meanwhile, the device&#39;s screen brightness and battery life don&#39;t quite match up to equivalent flagships from Apple and Samsung.</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting Woot&#39;s <a href="https://www.woot.com/faq?ref=w_ngf_rp#what-is-woots-return-policy">return policy</a> is more limited than that of Amazon. You can send back most goods within 30 days and Woot will reduce the refund amount by the cost of return shipping (as long as the product isn&#39;t defective or damaged). So, if you do snap up a Pixel 4 while it&#39;s on sale, it&#39;s probably best to decide quickly if you want to hang onto it.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-4-sale-woot-deal-android-smartphone-142609460.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ad6075c4-c8b0-45be-85b2-84daf931ac87</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 14:26:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627050372</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T14:26:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Conglomerates]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e87c1920-ebbf-11eb-9b7f-4d738be930cb" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e87c1920-ebbf-11eb-9b7f-4d738be930cb" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 4]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 4]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alphabet's latest moonshot aims to make industrial robots more practical]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alphabet has launched another company in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-30-chronicle-cybersecurity-alphabet-moonshot-x.html">X moonshot factory</a>, and this one may be its most ambitious <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-x-mineral-223517153.html">robotics project</a> to date. The <a href="https://blog.x.company/introducing-intrinsic-1cf35b87651">just-opened</a> firm, Intrinsic, plans to make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-adidas-abandons-robot-speedfactories-in-germany-and-the-us.html">industrial robots</a> more accessible to people and businesses that couldn&#39;t otherwise justify the effort involved to teach the machines. You could see robotic manufacturing in more countries, for example, or small businesses that can automate production that previously required manual labor.</p><p>Intrinsic will focus on software tools that make these robots easier to use, more flexible and more affordable. To that end, the company has been testing a mix of software tools that include AI techniques like automated perception, motion planning and reinforcement learning. Company chief Wendy Tan-White has relevant experience, too. She started the &quot;world&#39;s first&quot; software-as-a-service site builder to make web development more accessible, launched early online banking and lending services, and helped nurture startups as a VP at X.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The technology is still early, but there are already promising results. During its development time at X, the team trained a robot to make a USB connection in two hours (instead of programming it over hundreds of hours) and had robotic arms build simple furniture (shown below). Automation wouldn&#39;t be &quot;realistic or affordable&quot; for efforts like these using existing technology, Intrinsic said.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fc9c3ea0-ebb8-11eb-bcfe-b0c7bc6d40eb" style="height:288;width:512;" alt="Intrinsic industrial robots use perception, force control and planning to assemble furniture" data-uuid="62c3587c-7651-3591-80ba-ea6eaaf1d93c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intrinsic/X</div></figure><p>The new company still has much work to do. It&#39;s now focused more on creating a practical product and &quot;validating&quot; its tech. It&#39;s also hunting for partners in car manufacturing, electronics and healthcare that currently use industrial robots. If Intrinsic succeeds, though, it could make robotics more equitable and fill gaps in production. The company even suggests that its work could help the environment — the closer robotic factories are to people, the lower the emissions needed to transport goods to customers.</p><p>This might prove challenging. Rethink Robotics spent years developing collaborative robots that learn through simple human guidance, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-04-rethink-robotics-shuts-down.html">only to shut down</a> as sales fell short. X moonshot companies also aren&#39;t guaranteed to succeed — look at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loon-shutdown-014334705.html">Loon&#39;s fate</a> as an example. Alphabet&#39;s money could help where companies like Rethink struggled, however, and Intrinsic is focused more on solving overall robotics problems rather than specific scenarios. This effort might stand a better chance than most.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-x-intrinsic-industrial-robot-moonshot-140057232.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4eb581f6-049c-4f48-8b00-c8bad8d26785</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 14:00:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627046831</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T13:27:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9097a1c0-ebb0-11eb-bbed-4c2bfbfd69dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9097a1c0-ebb0-11eb-bbed-4c2bfbfd69dd" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intrinsic/Alphabet]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intrinsic logo for Alphabet X moonshot covering industrial robots]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intrinsic logo for Alphabet X moonshot covering industrial robots]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Pro 2 review: An excellent 5K headset for the VR faithful]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="88c991e8eae740c89c33f4761ce96090"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kATHHeP4Wfo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:HTC Vive Pro 2" href="https://bit.ly/3rvYTdZ">HTC Vive Pro 2</a> is a VR enthusiast&#39;s dream. Its 5K 120Hz display delivers the sharpest desktop VR experience I&#39;ve ever seen. And while its design hasn&#39;t changed from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-03-htc-vive-pro-review.html">2018 model</a>, it&#39;s still very comfortable to wear for extended sessions. But its high price and reliance on old controllers make it a tough sell. And let&#39;s be honest, it&#39;ll take a lot to dethrone the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">$299 Oculus Quest 2 </a>as the ideal VR headset for mainstream users.</p><p>That&#39;s not who HTC Vive is really targeted at, though. Like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">standalone Vive Focus 3</a>, this headset is clearly geared towards professionals. But unlike that device, it also has plenty to offer gamers. For them, spending $1,399 on the entire Vive Pro 2 package would be worth it to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html"><em>Half Life: Alyx</em></a> in the best quality possible. And if you&#39;ve already invested in the previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-03-htc-vive-pro-review.html">Vive Pro </a>or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html">Valve Index</a>, you can nab the new headset on its own for $799.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="96cb55eb-ae39-425c-b5f5-a7064c3f8924"/><p>Just be sure to keep track of which Vive Pro is which, because they look practically identical. The Pro 2 features a black and purple color scheme, but its front facia, strap and headphones all look the same as before. The difference becomes clear once you put on the Vive Pro 2, though: Its 5K screen offers 2,448 by 2,448 pixels per eye, a huge leap ahead of the 1,440 by 1,600 pixels from the Pro. Plus the Pro 2&#39;s LCDs have RGB sub-pixels, which helps make everything look sharper still. The screen can also refresh at up to a 120Hz, which is noticeably smoother than the previous 90Hz panel, and I appreciated the wider 120-degree field of view, which makes virtual worlds feel all the more immersive.</p><p>These specs may sound familiar, because the Vive Focus 3 also has the same 5K screen, it just happens to have a slower 90Hz refresh rate. But I came away far more impressed with the Pro 2, because it can easily run any PC VR game or app. The Focus 3, meanwhile, has a limited selection of mobile titles, and I was never able to successfully stream higher-end VR from my gaming PC. And, honestly, even if I got that to work, streaming is still a clear step down from running natively.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35896d1-eb10-11eb-b7ff-c8fd80773144" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2" data-uuid="31169255-820a-32dc-9309-a7c6c02fe00e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I revisited old and newer games on the Pro 2, and everything just looked fantastic. I kept getting distracted by the detailed environments in <em>Half Life Alyx</em> — a game that looked great on the Index, but has an extra level of polish with the Pro 2&#39;s resolution bump. It&#39;s sort of like the jump from 1080p video to 4K. You might not notice the difference  at first glance, but once you start inspecting the finer details like grass and wood grain you can tell you&#39;re working with more pixels.</p><p>Hopping back into <em>Superhot</em> almost felt like I was playing <em>Superhot 2</em>. I could make out plenty more detail in the game&#39;s cyberpunk introductory room. And even though its aesthetic is relatively simple, the game&#39;s enemies, weapons and environments all looked more detailed than I remembered. I also spent more time than I expected gawking at just about everything in the VR version of <em>Hellblade: Senua&#39;s Sacrifice</em>. That game already looked impressive on a normal monitor, but in 5K VR I could appreciate Senua&#39;s intricate character model even more.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3556280-eb10-11eb-b21f-bf58f5bd8c30" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2" data-uuid="2f9c6e5f-6b10-3211-abeb-510c51cbfae4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>As impressive as everything looked, though, I really wish HTC had upgraded the Pro 2&#39;s controllers. Its full kit includes the same enormous wands that came with the original Vive in 2016. They work decently enough, but they&#39;re not nearly as ergonomic as Oculus&#39;s touch controllers, or even the Focus 3&#39;s gamepads. They&#39;re particularly archaic after experiencing Valve&#39;s hand-tracking Steam VR controllers, which are bundled with the Index. Since it&#39;s a SteamVR headset as well, you could always use the Index gamepads with the Pro 2, but that&#39;s another $280 on top of an already expensive headset.</p><p>It also would have been nice to see HTC Vive upgrade the Pro 2&#39;s design a bit. It&#39;s still very comfortable, thanks to its plush cushioning along the front and back, as well as its balanced weight distribution. But the company could have taken a few cues from the Valve Index. Near-field speakers would have been a solid upgrade from on-ear headphones, especially since the Pro 2&#39;s cans tended to make my head feel warm. The headset&#39;s displays also generate a decent amount of heat as well, which led to some sweaty play sessions.</p><section data-eng-breakout="b0517a70dc3e47d6b435c5e237d35897" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e35848b0-eb10-11eb-af55-098a6d678d74" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2"></section><p>Setting up the Vive Pro 2 also takes a bit of work, but that shouldn&#39;t be a surprise to VR heads. It requires having two SteamVR base stations set up in opposite corners of your room, as well as USB 3.0 and DisplayPort cables running to a breakout box. If you&#39;ve already got base stations from the original Vive Pro or Valve Index, they&#39;ll still work. And if you don&#39;t, be sure to pick up the full Pro 2 kit, which includes the base stations and VR wands.</p><p>To get the most out of the Vive Pro 2, you&#39;ll also need to make sure you&#39;ve got some serious graphics power. I tested it on a system running an NVIDIA RTX 3080 Ti, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X and 32GB of RAM. That was enough to get smooth performance at the headset&#39;s full resolution, though I couldn&#39;t tell if I was always reaching 120fps to fill its refresh rate. I didn&#39;t notice any stuttering or slowdown, though. True VR aficionados typically stuff even more absurdly powerful hardware in their systems, so I&#39;d wager they&#39;d have a similar experience. But you can probably forget about getting anything truly usable out of the Vive Pro 2 using its minimum system requirements (a GTX 1060 and 4th-gen Intel CPU).</p><p>If you&#39;re stuck with slower hardware, and you don&#39;t want to fight to the death for a new GPU, you&#39;ll be better off with a less demanding VR headset. The Oculus Quest 2 remains my main recommendation for most people, since it offers excellent standalone virtual reality, as well as a simple way to connect it to your PC to stream high-end experiences. HP&#39;s Reverb G2 is another solid option based on its resolution alone, though I&#39;m not the biggest fan of its controllers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3556282-eb10-11eb-abf7-28cf22db9b3a" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2" data-uuid="1ce0d5ea-8817-3bdd-8b97-47ad3bf256ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I’ll admit, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Vive Pro 2" href="https://bit.ly/3rvYTdZ">Vive Pro 2</a> doesn’t sound like a great deal if you compare it to practically any other VR headset on the market, especially at its full $1,399 price. It’s in many ways an example of the greatest issue facing VR today: To get the best experiences, you’ll have to shell out a ridiculous amount of money, not to mention deal with a clunky setup process and annoying cables. That’s not stopping true virtual enthusiasts though — for them, and for businesses who need the highest quality VR around, the Vive Pro 2 is the new benchmark.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">062c2ddb-bc72-46b9-9a2a-cc4813619420</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 13:30:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627071568</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T20:19:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3553b70-eb10-11eb-adbb-58d3a3230e93" width="2000" height="1045" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3553b70-eb10-11eb-adbb-58d3a3230e93" width="2000" height="1045" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HTC Vive Pro 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Pro 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Tokyo Olympics' opening ceremony featured an orchestrated video game soundtrack]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Tokyo Olympics opening kicked off early this morning, and the parade of nations, where athletes walk through Japan&#39;s Olympic stadium, had a Japanese twist.

The combination of years worth of software updates and laptop manufacturers  making more powerful and better-built  Chromebooks means there are a ton of good Chrome OS machines that work well as everyday drivers. Of course, there are an unnecessary number of Chromebooks on the market, so choosing the right one is easier said than done. Fortunately, I’ve tried enough of them at this point to know what to look for and what to avoid.</p><h2>What is Chrome OS, and why would I use it over Windows?</h2><p>That’s probably the number one question about Chromebooks. There are plenty of inexpensive Windows laptops on the market, so why bother with Chrome OS? Glad you asked. For me, the simple and clean nature of Chrome OS is a big selling point. If you didn’t know, it’s based on Google’s Chrome browser, which means most of the programs you can run are web based. There’s no bloatware or unwanted apps to uninstall like you often get on Windows laptops, it boots up in seconds, and you can completely reset to factory settings almost as quickly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, the simplicity is also a major drawback for some users. Not being able to install native software can be a dealbreaker if you’re, say, a video editor or software developer. But there are also plenty of people who do the vast majority of their work in a browser. Unless I need to edit photos for a review, I can do my entire job on a Chromebook.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/28c4bed0-cd37-11eb-a7ff-de290c52cdf7" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 713" data-uuid="7bb7452a-b7d0-3f5e-b839-e8ce1a54bb00"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Google has also added support for Android apps on Chromebooks, which greatly expands the amount of software available. The quality varies widely, but it means you can do more with a Chromebook beyond just web-based apps. For example, you can install the Netflix app and save videos for offline watching; other Android apps like Microsoft’s Office suite and Adobe Lightroom are surprisingly capable. Between Android apps and a general improvement in web apps, Chromebooks are more than just a browser.</p><h2>What do Chromebooks do well, and when should you avoid them?</h2><p>Put simply, anything web based. Browsing, streaming music and video and using various social media sites are among the most common things people do on Chromebooks. As you might expect, they also work well with Google services like Photos, Docs, Gmail, Drive, Keep and so on. Yes, any computer that can run Chrome can do that too, but the lightweight nature of Chrome OS makes it a responsive and stable platform.</p><p>As I mentioned before, Chrome OS can run Android apps, so if you’re an Android user you’ll find some nice ties between the platforms. You can get most of the same apps that are on your phone on a Chromebook and keep info in sync between them. You can also use some Android phones as a security key for your Chromebook or instantly tether your laptop to use mobile data.</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/358e6910-bb98-11ea-ab7d-e1659e861e4b" alt="Google Pixelbook" data-uuid=""><figcaption>Nathan Ingraham / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>Google continues to tout security as a major differentiator for Chromebooks, and I think it’s definitely a factor worth considering. The first line of defense is auto-updates. Chrome OS updates download quickly in the background and a fast reboot is all it takes to install the latest version. Google says that each webpage and app on a Chromebook runs in its own sandbox, as well, so any security threats are contained to that individual app. Finally, Chrome OS has a self-check called Verified Boot that runs every time a device starts up. Beyond all this, the simple fact that you generally can’t install traditional apps on a Chromebook means there are a lot fewer ways for bad actors to access the system.</p><p>As for when to avoid them, the answer is simple: If you rely heavily on a specific native application for Windows or a Mac, chances are good you won’t find the exact same option on a Chromebook. That’s most true in fields like photo and video editing, but it can also be the case in fields like law or finance. Plenty of businesses run on Google’s G suite software, but more still have specific requirements that a Chromebook might not match. If you’re an iPhone user, you’ll also miss out on the way the iPhone easily integrates with an iPad or Mac, as well. For me, the big downside is not being able to access iMessage on a Chromebook.</p><p>Finally, gaming is almost entirely a non-starter, as there are no native Chrome OS games of note. You can install Android games from the Google Play Store, but that’s not what most people are thinking of when they want to game on a laptop. That said, Google’s game-streaming service Stadia has changed that long-standing problem. The service isn’t perfect, but it remains the only way to play recent, high-profile games on a Chromebook. It’s not as good as running local games on a Windows computer, but the lag issues that can crop up reflect mostly on Stadia itself and not Chrome OS.</p><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/4c76dcb0-bb99-11ea-9feb-9247a5659ee6" alt="Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h2><br>What are the most important specs for a Chromebook?</h2><p>Chrome OS is lightweight and usually runs well on fairly modest hardware, so the most important thing to look for might not be processor power or storage space. That said, I’d still recommend you get a Chromebook with a relatively recent Intel processor, ideally an eighth-generation or newer M3 or i3. Most non-Intel Chromebooks I’ve tried haven’t had terribly good performance, though Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet 2-in-1 runs surprisingly well on its MediaTek processor.</p><p>As for RAM, 4GB is enough for most people, though 8GB is a better target if you have the cash, want to future-proof your investment or if you’re a serious tab junkie. Storage space is another place where you don’t need to spend <em>too</em> much; 64GB should be fine for almost anyone. If you plan on storing a lot of local files or loading up your Chromebook with Linux or Android apps, get 128GB. But for what it’s worth, I’ve never felt like I might run out of local storage when using Chrome OS.</p><p>Things like the keyboard and display quality are arguably more important than sheer specs. The good news is that you can find less expensive Chromebooks that still have pretty good screens and keyboards that you won’t mind typing on all day. Many cheap Chromebooks still come with tiny, low-resolution displays, but at this point there’s no reason to settle for anything less than 1080p. (If you’re looking for an extremely portable, 11-inch Chromebook, though, you’ll probably have to settle for less.) Obviously, keyboard quality is a bit more subjective, but you shouldn’t settle for a mushy piece of garbage.</p><p>Google has an Auto Update policy for Chromebooks, and while that’s not a spec, per se, it’s worth checking before you buy. Basically, Chromebooks get regular software updates automatically for about six years from their release date (though that can vary from device to device). <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en">This support page</a> lists the Auto Update expiration date for virtually every Chromebook ever, but a good rule of thumb is to buy the newest machine you can to maximize your support.</p><h2>How much should I spend?</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/6b2e7aa0-bb99-11ea-bffe-c33913c3f803" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook" data-uuid=""><figcaption>Nathan Ingraham / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>Chromebooks started out notoriously cheap, with list prices often coming in under $300. But as they’ve gone more mainstream, they’ve transitioned from being essentially modern netbooks to the kind of laptop you’ll want to use all day. As such, prices have increased a bit over the last few years. At this point, you should expect to spend at least $400 if you want a solid daily driver. There are still many budget options out there that may be suitable as couch machines or secondary devices, but if you want a Chromebook that can be your all-day-every-day laptop, $400 is the least you can expect to spend.</p><p>There are also plenty of premium Chromebooks that approach or even exceed $1,000, but I don’t recommend spending that much. Generally, that’ll get you better design quality with more premium materials, as well as more powerful internals and extra storage space. Of course, you also sometimes pay for the brand name. But, the specs I outlined earlier are usually enough.</p><p>Right now, there actually aren’t too many Chromebooks that even cost that much. Google’s Pixelbook Go comes in $999 and $1,399 configurations, but the more affordable $650 and $850 options will be just as good for nearly everyone. Samsung released the $1,000 Galaxy Chromebook in 2020; this luxury device does almost everything right but has terrible battery life. Samsung quickly learned from that mistake and is now offering the Galaxy Chromebook 2 with more modest specs, but vastly better battery life at a much more affordable price (more on that laptop later). For the most part, you don’t need to spend more than $850 to get a premium Chromebook that’ll last you years.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h3>Best overall: Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook</h3><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/f654d800-bb98-11ea-b7dd-2fd5be9d3296" alt="Google Pixelbook Go" data-uuid=""><figcaption>Nathan Ingraham / Engadget </figcaption></figure><p>Look beyond the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review-170023587.html">awkward name</a> and you’ll find a Chromebook that does just about everything right that’s also a tremendous value. It gets all the basics right: The 13-inch 1080p touchscreen is bright, though it’s a little hard to see because of reflections in direct sunlight. It runs on a 10th-generation Intel Core i3 processor, the eight-hour battery life is solid, and the backlit keyboard is one of the best I’ve used on any laptop lately, Chromebook or otherwise. The Flex 5 is now a little over a year old, but it still holds up well and is even cheaper than it was when it first launched. It can now regularly be found for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:well under $400 on Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/36PVEEG">well under $400 on Amazon</a>. (As of this writing, it’s priced at $329.) That’s an outstanding value for a Chromebook this capable.</p><p>Naturally, Lenovo cut a few corners to hit that price. Most significantly, it only has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Normally, I wouldn’t recommend anyone buy a computer with those specs — but Chrome OS is far less dependent on local storage. Unless you were planning to store a ton of movies or install a huge variety of Android apps, 64GB is enough for moderately advanced use. I was concerned about the non-upgradeable 4GB of RAM, but my testing showed that the IdeaPad Flex 5 can run plenty of tabs and other apps without many hiccups. If you push things hard, you’ll occasionally have to wait for tabs to refresh if you haven’t viewed them recently, but other than that this is a solid performer, particularly for the price.</p><p>Other things in the IdeaPad Flex 5’s favor include that it has both USB-C and USB-A ports and a 360-degree convertible hinge. I personally don’t find myself flipping laptops around to tablet or stand mode very often, but it’s there if you like working in those formats. At three pounds and 0.66 inches thick, it’s not the lightest or slimmest option out there, but those specs are also totally reasonable considering the price.</p><p>Ultimately, the Ideapad Flex 5 hits the sweet spot for a large majority of potential Chromebook buyers out there, providing a level of quality and performance that’s pretty rare to find at this price point. That said, given this laptop has been out for over a year now, we’re keeping an eye out for any potential replacements Lenovo offers, as well as comparable options other manufacturers release.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook on Amazon - $430" href="https://amzn.to/36PVEEG">Buy Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook on Amazon - $430</a></p><h3>Upgrade picks: Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2, Acer Chromebook Spin 713</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/ab871810-96d5-11eb-b5fe-41c2db4984ea" alt="Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 laptop with its lid open sitting on a wooden table." data-uuid="7ab2a381-4ce9-3e15-8d3d-497f2294540d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Premium Chromebooks with more power, better design and higher prices have become common in recent years. If you want to step up over the excellent but basic Lenovo Flex 5, there are two recent options worth considering: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#x002019;s Galaxy Chromebook 2" href="https://fave.co/3mRQrTV">Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook 2</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Acer&#x002019;s Chromebook Spin 713" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/9WA6Vj">Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review-140021243.html">Galaxy Chromebook 2</a> is infinitely more stylish than most other Chromebooks, with a bright metallic red finish and a design that looks far better than the utilitarian Flex 5 and Chromebook Spin 713. As I mentioned earlier, Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook 2 fixes some of the serious flaws we identified in the original. Specifically, the 2020 Galaxy Chromebook had terrible battery life and cost $999; this year’s model starts at $549 and can actually last seven hours off the charger. That’s not great, but it’s far better than the lousy four hours the original offered.</p><p>Samsung cut a few corners to lower the Galaxy Chromebook 2’s price. Most noticeable is the 1080p 13.3-inch touchscreen, down from the 4K panel on the older model. The good news is that the display is among the best 1080p laptop screens I’ve seen in a long time, and the lower resolution helps the battery life, too. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 is also a bit thicker and heavier than its predecessor, but it’s still reasonably compact.</p><p>Finally, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 has a 10th-generation Intel Core i3 processor rather than the Core i5 Samsung included last year. All these changes add up to a laptop that isn’t as ambitious, but is ultimately much easier to recommend. Instead of pushing to have the best screen in the thinnest and lightest body with a faster processor, Samsung pulled everything back a bit to make a better-priced but still premium laptop.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/28c53400-cd37-11eb-bd93-ef3c5be3c6e5" alt="Acer Chromebook Spin 713" data-uuid="5663ca34-693a-318a-96f6-e8e722956c82"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html">Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713</a>, by comparison, doesn’t look like much from the outside — it’s a chunky gray slab with little to distinguish it from many other basic laptops. While it doesn’t seem exciting, the Spin 713 is just as well-made as the Galaxy Chromebook 2, with a sturdy hinge and body. But what’s most interesting is the display, a 13.5-inch touchscreen with a 3:2 aspect ratio. That makes it a much better option than 1080p displays when you’re scrolling vertically through documents and webpages. It has a somewhat unusual resolution of 2,256 x 1,504, thanks to the taller aspect ratio, but it makes for a more pixel-dense display than you’ll find on your standard 13.3-inch, 1080p laptop. Long story short: The screen is great.</p><p>As for the rest of the hardware, the 11th-generation Intel Core i5 processor is more than enough power for most tasks, and the keyboard and trackpad are solid, if not the best I’ve used before. The same can be said for battery life: I got about the same six to seven hours using the Spin 713 as I did using the Galaxy Chromebook 2. I wish it were better in both cases, but it’s in line with other premium Chromebooks I’ve used lately.</p><p>The Spin 713 configuration that I tested costs $699, the same as the Galaxy Chromebook 2. Because I’m such a fan of the 3:2 display, I prefer the Spin 713 (which also has a more powerful processor), but the Galaxy Chromebook 2 is worth a look if you want a laptop that has a little more style and a better keyboard.</p><p>Last year, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Google&#x002019;s Pixelbook Go" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/ZdXGVg">Google’s Pixelbook Go</a> was our pick for the best premium model. It’s still an excellent choice and one of my favorite Chromebooks to use, but it’s almost two years old. Its age coupled with its aging 8th-generation Intel processor make it tougher to recommend. That said, it’s still one of the thinnest and lightest Chromebooks around, and it still handles everything I can throw at it. It also has the best keyboard I’ve used on any recent Chromebook. There’s still a lot to like, but it’s harder to justify spending $650 or more on it. Hopefully Google will release an updated version this fall.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 starting at $549" href="https://fave.co/3mRQrTV">Buy Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 starting at $549</a><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Acer Chromebook Spin 713 at Best Buy - $629" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/9WA6Vj">Buy Acer Chromebook Spin 713 at Best Buy - $629</a></p><h3>A good option for kids: Acer Chromebook 512</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f7ab540-ebb2-11eb-abfb-1eaab65915ef" alt="Acer Chromebook 512" data-uuid="e86216a4-72b6-31ce-b39b-1cd4c2fe1414"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Acer</div></figure><p>While Lenovo’s Flex 5 is inexpensive enough that you could get one for your kid, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Acer&#x002019;s Chromebook 512" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Ea960Q">Acer’s Chromebook 512</a> might be a better option for young ones in your life. First off, it’s specifically built to take abuse. In addition to the military-rated (MIL-STD 810G) impact-resistant body, you can spill up to 330mL of liquid on the keyboard. A drainage system will flush it out and keep the insides working. (Note that I haven’t actually tried that.) The keyboard features “mechanically anchored” keys that should be harder for kids to pick off, too. Regardless of exactly how much water you can pour onto that keyboard, the Chromebook 512 should handle a child’s abuse better than your average laptop.</p><p>This computer isn’t a speed demon, but the Intel Celeron N4000 chip coupled with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage should be fine for basic tasks. The 12-inch screen isn’t a standout either, but it has the same taller 3:2 aspect ratio as Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713. That means you’ll get more vertical screen real estate than you would on the 16:9, 11-inch panels typically found in laptops of this class. (The Chromebook 512’s screen resolution is 1,366 x 912, whereas most 11-inch Chromebooks use a 1,366 x 768 panel.)</p><p>All in all, it’s a fairly modest computer, but grade-school kids, a computer that can take some abuse and runs an easy-to-use OS that’s well supported in education should fit the bill well. The Chromebook 512 is priced at $249.99 direct from Acer, but it&#39;s going for $219.99 as of this writing at other retailers.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Acer Chromebook 512 at Best Buy - $220" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Ea960Q">Buy Acer Chromebook 512 at Best Buy - $220</a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">71ca355e-be06-3ba2-a84a-3e55a19dbc84</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 12:45:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627045777</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T13:10:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[chromeos]]></category><category><![CDATA[chromebook]]></category><category><![CDATA[hp]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[google]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[samsung]]></category><category><![CDATA[feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[asus]]></category><category><![CDATA[bts2020]]></category><category><![CDATA[lenovo]]></category><category><![CDATA[laptops]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/d8c18b40-bb97-11ea-a5fe-af97d6f8bf2f" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/d8c18b40-bb97-11ea-a5fe-af97d6f8bf2f" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixelbook Go]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixelbook Go]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Today's Google doodle is an anime-infused sports game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has gone all-out on today&#39;s doodle to mark the start of the Tokyo Olympics.

Weeks after they dropped to $190, the wireless headphones are down another $20 at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Best Buy" href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/kjzYKx">Best Buy</a> to a new low of $170.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Sony WH-1000XM3 at Best Buy - $170" href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/kjzYKx">Buy Sony WH-1000XM3 at Best Buy - $170</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We gave the XM3 a review score of 94 in September 2018 due to their excellent sound and comfort. Inside is a dedicated noise-canceling chip, the QN1, which does the heavy-lifting in terms of blocking background noise and boosting audio. For those unaccustomed to ANC, you may even notice new sounds on the tracks you love.  Audiophiles will also take to the customization offered through Sony&#39;s app that lets you fine-tune audio.</p><p>We&#39;d be remiss if we didn&#39;t mention the XM3&#39;s successors, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh-1000xm4-headphones-review-150050779.html">XM4</a>. The newer headphones feature two major additions: Auto-pause and seamless multi-device listening. Hardly a deal-breaker when you consider they currently cost $348.&nbsp;</p><p>The XM3&#39;s design is also a crowdpleaser. The over-ear headphones come in black with bronze accents on the Sony logo and USB-C<strong>&nbsp;</strong>port. In our tests, we found the plush cushioning around the pads and headband to be significantly more comfortable than some of the alternatives. You can also fold them up when you&#39;re not using them, making them great for travel. The XM3 offer around 30 hours of battery life, more than enough for regular commuters. A well-powered USB-C connection also provides five hours of charge after just 10 minutes.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-wh1000xm3-headphones-deal-114006907.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">758b2f5a-4487-4ae3-aa49-e136859977d6</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 11:40:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627038081</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T11:01:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5deb7cd0-eba4-11eb-a7d5-56ab875a21dd" width="675" height="402" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5deb7cd0-eba4-11eb-a7d5-56ab875a21dd" width="675" height="402" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: LG adds a mic and speaker to its high-tech air-purifying mask]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Remember the high-tech face masks teased during the relatively early days of the COVID-19  pandemic?

Now, a group of astronomers has <a href="https://www.eso.org/public/archives/releases/sciencepapers/eso2111/eso2111a.pdf">discovered</a> (PDF) what&#39;s believed to be a region with exomoons-in-the-making for the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/science/moon-forming-region-seen-around-planet-another-solar-system-2021-07-22/">first time</a>. Myriam Benisty and team from the University of Grenoble found the disk of dust — the moon-forming region — around a young exoplanet in a star system dubbed PDS 70 located 370 light years from Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>The team found the first protoplanet (PDS 70b) in the system back in 2018 using European Southern Observatory&#39;s Very Large Telescope in Chile. A year later, they found another young gas giant (PDS 70c) using the same equipment. The astronomers believe based on the data they have that the star system is only 10 million years old and that both gas giants are several times bigger than Jupiter. To know more about the system, they focused all other possible instruments on it, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-14-earths-largest-telescope-supercomputer.html">Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array</a>. ALMA is made up of 66 short-wavelength radio dishes, and its observations made it possible to spot the dust around PDS 70c.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The disk of dust spans a distance slightly wider than that between Earth and the Sun, and there&#39;s enough mass in there for three moons the same size as ours. Benisty says the moons may have already formed, but  there&#39;s no conclusive proof yet because they can&#39;t be seen with ALMA.

The company&#39;s DX and DX+ range of damage-resistant glass will next be <a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/news/news-releases/2021/07/corning-expands-corning-gorilla-glass-composite-products-to-optimize-performance-of-mobile-device-cameras.html">available</a> for mobile camera lens covers, starting with Samsung devices. Alongside the added protection, Corning claims its tech can improve the optical performance of smartphone cameras.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the company, DX glass essentially results in less light being reflected by the camera cover lens. Currently, even with the use of an anti-reflective coating, around 92 percent of transmitted light enters a smartphone camera. Corning says that with DX/DX+ on the outside a camera lens can capture 98 percent of light, helping to reduce optical issues like ghosting. These reflections are usually caused by a bright light source during daylight or in low-light conditions. Lens hoods and coatings applied to lens surfaces can help to suppress ghosting, also known as ghost reflections.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some smartphone makers are already working with specialist suppliers to address the problem. Both <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-4k-camera-pro-best-phone-in-years-150049871.html">Sony</a> and <a href="https://cn.engadget.com/vivo-x60-pro-plus-123326888.html">Vivo</a> use a Zeiss coating to boost light transmission while reducing flares, ghosting and reflections on their high-end phones.</p><p>But, Corning also offers the added benefit of durability and has strong ties with the biggest smartphone makers in the field. The company says its DX glass is scratch resistant and that DX+ approaches the resistance of Sapphire, which is used in high-end watches thanks to its Grade 9 on the Mohs scale — a system for rating the hardness of various minerals.

The group took advantage of vulnerabilities in the Kaseya software companies use to send out updates to computer networks, allowing it to distribute ransomware to as many as 1,500 businesses and organizations worldwide. Most of them are just small businesses, and some of the victims in New Zealand are schools, which aren&#39;t your typical ransomware targets. Now, Kaseya has <a href="https://www.kaseya.com/potential-attack-on-kaseya-vsa/">announced</a> that it has obtained a universal decryptor and will help those &quot;impacted by the incident.&quot;</p><p>REvil originally demanded a payment of $70 million for a universal decryptor that will unlock the data owned by victims of the July 2nd attack. In mid-July, however, the group suddenly fell off the face of the internet. The critical sites it uses to communicate with victims vanished shortly after President Biden revealed that he talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin about ransomware attacks originating from his country. It&#39;s still unclear if the group disappeared from the internet as a result of that talk, of an offensive cyber operation conducted by US authorities or of something else entirely.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its announcement, Kaseya said it &quot;obtained the tool from a third party&quot; and that it worked with software company Emsisoft to confirm that it can unlock victims&#39; data. It also said that it formed teams to actively help &quot;customers affected by the ransomware to restore their environments&quot; and that its representatives will contact clients who haven&#39;t heard from the company yet.</p><p>When <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/kaseya-obtains-universal-decryptor-for-revil-ransomware-victims/"><em>BleepingComputer</em></a> asked Kaseya if it paid the ransom to obtain the key, the company replied that it &quot;can&#39;t confirm or deny that.&quot; The publication also asked the FBI if it was involved in obtaining the decryption key, but the agency refused to comment on an ongoing investigation. That means that key&#39;s origin is still a mystery, though we doubt its source matters for the victims that just want to access their locked data.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kaseya-master-decryption-key-revil-attack-081230168.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c2a1a08e-521e-477f-9cc0-b8abacc3a64e</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 08:12:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627028018</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T08:13:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/ec8e6300-447c-11eb-9afd-751a15e105d0" width="8660" height="5773" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/ec8e6300-447c-11eb-9afd-751a15e105d0" width="8814" height="5876" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AndreyPopov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Worried Businessman Looking At Laptop With Ransomware Word On The Screen At The Workplace]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Person Looking At Laptop Screen]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA's InSight probe reveals the first detailed look at the interior of Mars]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#39;s InSight lander <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-26-nasa-insight-lander-arrived-on-mars.html">arrived on Mars</a> in 2018 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-20-nasa-insight-lander-seismometer-positioned.html">learn about its interior</a> by monitoring &quot;marsquakes,&quot; and now the project is starting to really pay off. NASA has <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8996/nasas-insight-reveals-the-deep-interior-of-mars/">announced</a> that researchers have mapped the red planet&#39;s interior and discovered some big surprises and major differences with Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>The map is the first ever of the interior of another planet. Compared to Earth, Mars has a thicker crust, thinner mantle layer and a bigger, less dense and more liquid core than expected. That in turn suggests that Mars may have formed millions of years before our planet, when the sun itself was still not fully formed.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;It gives us our first sample of the inside of another rocky planet like Earth, built out of the same materials but very, very different,&quot; University of Cambridge seismologist Sanne Cottaar (who wasn&#39;t involved in the project) told the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nasas-insight-lander-gives-first-look-at-mars-interior-yielding-a-big-surprise-11626976810"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>. “It is impressive.”</p><p>Constructing a map from the limited data provided by InSight was no easy feat. The probe only recorded quakes from one location and has just a single seismometer, for one thing. And Mars — while seismically active — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-25-nasa-insight-marsquakes.html">didn&#39;t have</a> any quakes larger than around 4 on the Richter scale.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c5fa7980-eb80-11eb-b0da-6344cbeeb430" alt="NASA&#39;s Insight reveals the first detailed look at the interior of Mars" data-uuid="5b205496-3f87-30ea-bd61-b086e4323c7f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Science</div></figure><p>Still, taking that data, along with planet&#39;s magnetism and orbital wobbles, scientists were able to create a detailed map. The planet&#39;s innermost core was found to have a diameter of around 2,275 miles, larger than previously thought. Given the mass of the planet as a whole, that implies that the iron/nickel core likely contains lighter elements like sulfur, oxygen and carbon.&nbsp;</p><p>The crust, meanwhile, was found to be very old. It was also thicker in Mars&#39; southern highlands and thinner in the northern lowlands, which may have hosted oceans long ago. On average, it&#39;s between 15 and 45 miles thick and split into several layers of volcanic rock.</p><p>The mantle between the crust and core extends roughly 970 miles below the surface. It&#39;s thinner than Earth&#39;s and has a different composition which suggests the two planets arose from different materials when they formed. This “might be the simple explanation why we don’t see plate tectonics on Mars,” ETH Zurich geophysicist and study co-author Amir Khan told the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/22/science/mars-nasa-insight.html?smid=tw-nytimesscience&amp;smtyp=cur"><em>New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The results has given scientists new insight into not just the inside of Mars, but how rocky planets form in general. That will help them develop new theories about planet formation that could become particularly valuable in the near future, when new instruments like the James Webb Space Telescope will allow astronomers to scan exoplanets around the galaxy. NASA will reveal more about its findings in a live event <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/nasa-s-insight-reveals-the-deep-interior-of-mars">later today</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasas-insight-reveals-the-first-detailed-look-at-the-interior-of-mars-071812860.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97363ad9-9af4-4317-9845-ab64a7ec69d3</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jul 2021 07:18:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627043153</ingested><modified>2021-07-23T12:26:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fb021040-ebb0-11eb-bcbf-7831f70ace54" width="976" height="654" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/fb021040-ebb0-11eb-bcbf-7831f70ace54" width="976" height="654" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A photograph of Mars' surface from the InSight lander probe]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mars InSight]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla Powerwall owners can sign up to help balance California's energy grid]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla has launched a new program that will allow Powerwall owners to kick power back to the grid in times of high usage.
