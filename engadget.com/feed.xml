He&#39;s calling it <a href="https://truthsocial.com/">TRUTH Social</a>, and the platform is apparently part of his camp&#39;s efforts to fight back against &quot;the Big Tech companies of Silicon Valley, which have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.&quot;</p><p>Some of Trump&#39;s supporters believe that social networks are biased against conservative voices — in 2018, a group even sued Twitter, Facebook and Google, accusing them of breaking antitrust laws and violating their First Amendment rights by conspiring to suppress conservative viewpoints. The case was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judges-drop-social-media-anti-conservative-case-175623139.html">tossed</a> out of court a few times. According to a New York University research <a href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/bias-report-release-page">published</a> earlier this year, there&#39;s no evidence of conservative bias on the world&#39;s most popular social networks. There was even an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-bug-heavily-favored-trump-content-over-biden-172758201.html">Instagram bug</a> in the months leading to the US Presidential Elections that favored Trump content over Biden&#39;s.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It is true, however, that Facebook and Twitter banned Trump from their platforms following the January 6th US Capitol riots. Twitter determined that his tweets at that time violated its policies. According to the website, his tweets (which you can view in an <a href="https://www.thetrumparchive.com/">archive</a>) &quot;must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence...&quot;</p><p>Earlier this month, Trump <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-sues-to-get-his-twitter-account-back-143200517.html">sued</a> to get his Twitter account back, arguing that the ban violates his First Amendment rights. Indeed, his ban on the website gets a special mention in TRUTH Social&#39;s announcement. He said in a statement: &quot;We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American President has been silenced.&quot;</p><p>TRUTH Social will have a beta launch in November for invited guests. Trump and his team are expecting to roll it out nationwide in the first quarter of 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/trump-truth-social-061457538.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a4f03eb1-e52a-4bba-add8-62c6cf001b6b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 06:14:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634796917</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T06:15:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/be021f50-322d-11ec-b4eb-ffc306c1df14" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/be021f50-322d-11ec-b4eb-ffc306c1df14" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Scott Olson via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DES MOINES, IOWA - OCTOBER 09: Former President Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a rally at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on October 09, 2021 in Des Moines, Iowa.

As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736837/google-calendar-focus-blocks-entries-auto-decline-meetings">reports</a>, Google has a simple answer: make it clear you should be left alone.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/paypal-looking-buy-digital-pinboard-site-pinterest-bloomberg-news-2021-10-20/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the payments company made a $45 billion offer on Wednesday to buy the social network. News of the potential sale was first reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-20/paypal-said-to-explore-purchase-of-social-media-firm-pinterest"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> earlier in the day. The outlet put the value of the deal at approximately $39 billion, noting PayPal planned to finance it mostly through stock.</p><p>At first glance, PayPal’s interest in Pinterest may seem like a head-scratcher, but an acquisition could help the company gain a foothold in the growing social commerce space. That’s an area where Pinterest has been an active player since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-03-pinterest-buyable-pins-android-shopping.html">2015</a>. In a way, Pinterest is also a safe purchase.

Epic has signed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html">Eyes Out</a>, the brand-spanking-new studio founded by <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck, and also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-05-road-not-taken-review-take-it.html">Spry Fox</a>, a veteran, award-winning indie developer known for heartwarming games such as <em>Cozy Grove</em>, <em>Alphabear</em> and <em>Road Not Taken</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>As a publisher, Epic offers to cover 100 percent of all development costs, and once a game comes out and breaks even in sales, the signed studio receives at least 50 percent of all profits. Epic doesn&#39;t exert creative control over its partnered games, and the developers retain the intellectual property rights to their work. Epic signed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-26-epic-publishing-remedy-playdead-gendesign-games.html">Remedy Entertainment, Playdead and genDESIGN</a> in March 2020, and today&#39;s announcement marks the second batch of contracted studios.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We’re open to publishing many types of games from the most talented developers, and the studios we’re partnering with are making some of the coolest, experimental and ambitious stuff out there,&quot; head of Epic Games Publishing Hector Sanchez told Engadget. &quot;They have our full support – including Epic’s publishing and promotional services, resources, and experience – which means they can focus solely on making the best games possible.&quot;</p><p>Eyes Out is staffed with enormous creative energy, but it&#39;s unproven as a team. Davis, Finck and their collaborators are working on their debut title, a mysterious arthouse horror game with an emphasis on experimental audio and cosmic terror. The studio&#39;s teasers are filled with moody desert landscapes and unsettling layers of sound. In a chat <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html">with Engadget in September</a>, Davis said he wants to &quot;create mind-bending experiences that cause you to question reality.&quot;</p><div id="2b6cc08eb69141a8ac2dbf86eb82c535"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moPq2z_jYTg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The publisher relationship goes even deeper for Eyes Out, too — the studio received an Epic MegaGrant in 2019, which gave them the runway to build their first proof-of-concept. Epic further funded the studio&#39;s prototype, allowing them to expand their team in the process. And now, Eyes Out is officially part of Epic Games Publishing.</p><p>&quot;From the very beginning, Robin and I knew that Eyes Out was going to require a unique publishing partner willing to empower our vision of the strange, ambitious worlds we would create together, and one capable of fueling it,&quot; Davis said about today&#39;s news. He continued, &quot;Our collaboration with Epic continued to bear fruit. Working with Epic is really the first time I’ve felt entirely unleashed as a director, both technically and creatively. Together we’re aimed to create the thing that’s closest to my heart.&quot;</p><p>Spry Fox, meanwhile, is working on its most ambitious project to date, which <a href="https://twitter.com/spryfox/status/1450850917696229380">it describes</a> as a &quot;non-violent multiplayer game designed to encourage friendship and reduce loneliness in the world.&quot; It&#39;ll come to multiple platforms, and support cross-play and cross-progression. The first bit of concept art from Spry Fox&#39;s new game depicts a pastel, <em>Atlantis</em>-esque world with a massive yellow whale floating across the sky.</p><p>&quot;This is the first time in our history that we at Spry Fox have chosen to work with a publisher in this manner,&quot; studio co-founder and CEO David Edery said. &quot;Up until now, we have only worked with publishers for much more limited regional publishing and porting arrangements. But we felt for a project as ambitious as this one, we needed more support than usual, and Epic seemed like the right company to provide that support.&quot;</p><div id="f319868e23a24922806eb34b01261e3f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are excited to announce that we&#39;re working on our next and most ambitious game with the wonderful folks at <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGamesPub?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EpicGamesPub</a>!

Outside of direct publishing deals, Epic also offers free access to Unreal Engine, a powerful game-development toolset, and it throws money at artists through programs like <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants">Epic MegaGrants</a>, a $100 million fund for burgeoning creatives. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-13-epic-games-store-steam-competition.html">Epic Games Store</a> went live in 2018 as a direct competitor to Steam, offering better financial terms for developers and challenging Valve to implement the same deal (spoiler: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-18-half-life-alyx-valve-steam-stockholders-boo.html">Valve didn&#39;t</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>More recently, Epic waged a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-xcloud-app-store-130053155.html">very public</a> legal battle against Apple, arguing the iPhone-maker enjoyed monopolistic control over the App Store and offered unfair terms to developers. In the end, the lawsuit played out like any other fight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-apple-google-indie-developers-app-store-210830045.html">between multibillion-dollar corporations</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">little change</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-court-appeals-epic-games-175240669.html">lots of press</a>.</p><p>Throughout the lawsuit, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney attacked Apple for engaging in greedy, anti-consumer and anti-developer practices. This is kind of his thing — since founding Epic more than 30 years ago, Sweeney has been consistent in his mantra that game development should be accessible to as many people as possible.

Once the limits come into effect in 90 days, companies that want to sell their hacking tools to countries “of national security or weapons of mass destruction concern” will need to obtain a license from the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).

There are already many limitations on the export of intrusion software. Similarly, there are opportunities for companies to obtain exceptions. The main point is that the policy would cover the sale of software to countries like China and Russia. It would also limit the sale of programs like NSO’s  Pegasus spyware, which some governments have used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html"><ins>target dissidents and journalists</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The United States Government opposes the misuse of technology to abuse human rights or conduct other malicious cyber activities, and these new rules will help ensure that US companies are not fueling authoritarian practices,” the Commerce Department said.</p><p>Among the 42 countries involved in the <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/wassenaar"><ins>Wassenaar Arrangement</ins></a>, a pact that sets voluntary export controls on military and dual-use technologies, the US is one of the last to impose limits on the sale of hacking software.

It&#39;s a full-frame interchangeable model that can use either DJI&#39;s DL or Leica M lenses (along with other mirrorless lenses via adapters) and comes with no less than nine built-in neutral-density (ND) filters for controlling exposure.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f2d1d940-31c5-11ec-859f-308a2e72d806" alt="DJI&#39;s Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system" data-uuid="81654643-dde0-39e3-a68e-c5da7dc5f72e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure><p>It&#39;s available either in a 6K model that can handle 6K at 60fps and 4K at 120fps, or an 8K 75 fps version. It can capture files in RAW, ProRes or H.264, allowing maximum flexibility in production. DJI claims 14 stops of dynamic range, and it should be good in low-light thanks to the dual-native 800/5000 ISO.&nbsp;</p><p>The gimbal itself is one of the first to offer Z-axis stabilization, DJI said. The aim is to reduce vertical jarring when a camera operator walks or runs, a trick that usually requires considerable skill. Helping in that regard is the Ronin 4D&#39;s relatively small size and 4.67 kg (10.3 pounds) heft, excluding the lens and storage card. It uses data from downward time of flight (ToF) sensors, forward and downward dual-visual sensors, a built-in IMU and a barometer. It also comes with DJI&#39;s ActiveTrack Pro (similar to that found on its consumer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dj-osmo-mobile-5-gimbal-selfie-stick-135559718.html">gimbals</a> and drones), which uses AI to power framing and tracking.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0321dfc0-31c6-11ec-bcef-11aec4474753" alt="DJI&#39;s Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system" data-uuid="e5b60c0a-f67b-35ad-8ed1-bcab8a22b332"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">tomgo.tang/DJI</div></figure><p>As for the LiDAR focusing system, it offers &quot;43,200 ranging points reaching as far as 10 meters, locating subjects quickly and accurately, even in low-light environments,&quot; DJI said in a press release. It didn&#39;t mention any other autofocus technology used by the camera, though it &quot;supports human face/body recognition and framing of any subject.&quot; It also noted that the system &quot;measures the distance to the subject without relying on surface textures or hunting for edges,&quot; implying it doesn&#39;t employ contrast-detect AF.&nbsp;</p><p>The system supports full autofocus, manual focus and &quot;Automated Manual Focus&quot; (AMF) that allows camera operators to &quot;pull focus with extreme precision.&quot; The general idea with AMF is that the autofocus handles most AF chores, but allows the operate to intervene manually at any point.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/181b2300-31c6-11ec-baef-011c114d466f" alt="DJI&#39;s Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system" data-uuid="93fc25c1-0bfc-388f-a783-7eba1495dd04"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure><p>Other features including a long range (20,000 feet) video transmitter that outputs a 1080/60p feed to remote monitors, three storage methods (USB SSD, CFexpress Type-B and DJI&#39;s proprietary PROSSD 1TB), built-in microphones along with 3.5mm mic ports and XLR ports via an expansion plate, and a battery with up to 2.5 hours of shooting time.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Ronin 4D" href="https://bit.ly/3jkuL2c">Ronin 4D</a> with a 6K camera costs $7,199, while the 8K model is $11,499.

That&#39;s a lot, of course, but less than some cinema camera systems by themselves — and DJI&#39;s Ronin 2 cinema stabilizer runs $8,000-plus without any camera at all.&nbsp;</p><div id="1008a71d59f445bcb0bd2160262ae7cc"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiVJnRXUwKw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dj-is-8-k-ronin-4-d-camera-has-a-built-in-gimbal-and-li-dar-autofocus-system-165716323.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">415191e2-4cfa-437c-b9a2-792812b7aef3</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 16:57:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634749984</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T17:13:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[USA News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Budget, Tax & Economy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/485e6370-31c0-11ec-af5b-4e719049551c" width="2048" height="1256" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/485e6370-31c0-11ec-af5b-4e719049551c" width="2048" height="1256" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DJI]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DJI's Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DJI's Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Windows 11 beta users can start testing Android apps]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You finally have a chance to try Android apps in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a> — provided you&#39;re willing to live on the bleeding edge for a while.

The original M1 processor paired four high-performance and four low-power cores with a 7- or 8-core GPU, and with that set up it delivered impressive results. The M1-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro bested a 16-inch MacBook Pro with an 8-core Intel i9 CPU and dedicated GPU <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLVcRkFtEcA">when we tested it last year</a>, and did so while staying impressively cool and quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The new M1 Pro and M1 Max bump the core count to eight high-performance and two low-power cores, and add 16, 24, or 32 GPU cores. With twice the high-performance CPUs, and up to four times the GPU cores as the original M1, these chips should be incredibly fast, but expect it to come at the cost of more heat and noise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="def1a7f33bce42809bb77e04abf49a9d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9QvfmV_DgbU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Despite a shortage of compatible games, the original M1 proved to be a remarkably adept processor for gaming, and these new chips should be even better, outpacing most Intel CPUs and maybe even besting a mobile NVIDIA RTX 3080 GPU&#39;s performance. The new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBooks also come with a 120Hz display with HDR, and improved speakers.

The amount of stuff that mom’s need to keep track of is, in a word, immense. Since I brought my twins home from the hospital, I’ve used <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/baby-tracker-newborn-log/id779656557">an app</a> to note every bottle, diaper change, nap, medication, bath time and more. That’s worked well so far, but now that my kids are older, I’ve had a harder time immediately logging their events. That’s partially because our routines were interrupted with a recent move and partially because they <em>really </em>want to play with my phone every time they see it. Regardless, I’m trying to get us all back into an established pattern of meals and nap times so I’ve been wanting to re-establish my habit of logging all their details.</p><p>Talli sells a $99 physical gadget for this purpose: a single-touch tracking device that lets busy, sleep-deprived parents push a button to log activities like bottle feeds and bedtimes. The <a href="https://fave.co/3iXtgGW">Talli Baby one-touch tracker</a> includes seven pre-assigned buttons and a miscellaneous eighth, and it pairs with an app to provide you the best of both worlds. A single-function device to track kids’ care may not sound like a big deal, but if you’ve ever tried to operate a touchscreen with diaper cream all over your hands, you may be able to see the utility here.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/72e24170-30e4-11ec-bfdf-b49595c6e30b" alt="Talli Baby One Touch Tracker" data-uuid="83b7e639-7cb8-3382-b129-b295cdaaa487"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amber Bouman/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Talli is a white and faux-woodgrain box with rounded edges, roughly the size of a small but stuffed wallet. It has two rows of four activity buttons with icons to indicate which action the button is assigned to: bottle feeding, solid food, wet diaper, dirty diaper, sleeping, nursing, pumping or “miscellaneous,” which can be customized within the app. Events that happen at the same time — say, a wet and dirty diaper — require simultaneous button presses. There’s also a small WiFi button on the lower right that’s used during setup, and the company says that WiFi is only used when the device is transmitting an event. The rear contains slots to wall-mount the Talli using the included hardware.</p><p>Setting up the Talli is fairly uncomplicated and follows the same steps as many other app-connected devices: download the app, create an account, add a device, connect to a WiFi network and you’re done. When I first set up the device, it kept flashing an error message, which the included start-up pamphlet instructed me was a WiFi connection issue likely due to an incorrect network name or password.</p><p>Only I hadn’t gotten to that step yet, I was only trying to sync the device. I contacted Talli support and tried again and was able to connect and set up the device without any further issue. It’s worked normally since then so I’m not certain what the issue was, but it did make me realize that adding a hardware device to my tracking process meant there would be another potential point of failure. Since Talli pairs with an app that can be used independently to track what you’re doing with your kids, it wouldn’t be the end of the world if the hardware wasn’t working. However, it would detract from the main advantage of the system: the convenience of pressing a button on the tracker and continuing with your day.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b021e1d0-30e4-11ec-be57-12f1f9232edd" alt="Talli Baby One Touch Tracker" data-uuid="bf0d407d-da47-3d0c-9aba-2cfee0d3782d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amber Bouman/Engadget</div></figure><p>Taking out my smartphone, opening an app and typing in an entry isn’t exactly heavy lifting, but doing that while two toddlers wind themselves between my legs, grab at my phone, whine, harass the cat, throw everything out of the kitchen drawers and try to climb over child gates is another story. Being able to press a button and be done was an unexpected relief: My kid’s data was logged, so I knew when they were last changed and I could always flesh out the entries with more detail in the app later (though I’ll admit that rarely happened). It was extremely easy to use the Talli instead of my previous app, and it was oddly satisfying, too — not unlike crossing something off a to-do list.</p><p>Because Talli runs on four AA batteries, it has a portable design allowing it to be moved anywhere or handed off to any caretakers or babysitters. It can also be mounted on a wall, which has advantages and disadvantages depending on how you’ll use it. I kept my Talli untethered because my changing table area doesn’t have the best WiFi coverage, so I kept it on a nearby shelf where I could touch the buttons on my way in and out of the room.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0a0dd510-310c-11ec-997f-532cdf7aaeb7" alt="Talli Baby" data-uuid="f34f71b1-0e49-31c5-b4f5-42bdc28e5a0e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Talli</div></figure><p>Frankly, I would have preferred to mount the thing; when grabbing for the device, I would often accidentally hit a button and register an incorrect event, which I would then have to remember to delete later. But I also often had to move the Talli out of sight, because my son is particularly enamored with pushing buttons and things that light up, so the Talli was like forbidden candy to him. It was hard to find the perfect location where the device was connected to my WiFi network, easily accessible to me and didn’t draw his attention.</p><p>Each Talli device gets assigned to one child, that is to say you’ll need one Talli per child. But you can assign multiple devices to the same child if you end up getting more than one for different areas of your home. And Talli works with Alexa, so you can have the assistant log events for you if you say “Alexa tell Talli Baby that Sam had a dirty diaper.” You can also request that Alexa read you the most recent activity reports. I don’t currently have an Alexa-enabled device, so I wasn’t able to test this out yet. The company says Google Home compatibility is coming soon, too.</p><h2>Software</h2><p>Much like the device itself, the Talli app is  simply designed and straightforward to use. The home screen contains the same icons as the device; when a button is active — it turns green for a pumping session or a nap time, for example. Near each button is a date and time stamp for the last logged event and tapping on the icon brings up an entry page to edit and add details. I sometimes had to tap commands a few times — say, to pause or start a sleep timer — but this otherwise worked fine.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9c220070-30e9-11ec-bfe9-e479f059f977" alt="Talli Baby app" data-uuid="5998f4f5-111e-3e61-9ffe-b356f4f46f35"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The rest of the app is organized into a Daily List, which is exactly what it sounds like: a list of your child’s daily events. There’s also a Details view which provides an hour-by-hour graph of events and can be toggled to show any of your child’s metrics over a time period. My favorites were the Averages view, which shows totals for each event, and the More tab, which has selections for account sharing, reminders and children’s profiles. I’m trying to switch the twins over to all solid foods and being able to track what they’ve eaten, how much and when has helped me establish routines and menus. And because it was easy to press a button on the way in or out of the room, Talli made it possible for me to log how often my son woke in the middle of the night and how long before he went back to sleep.</p><p>However, the app frequently (albeit briefly) flashed a “Refreshing your data” screen when I navigated around the options. I had to wait an extra beat or two for the data to refresh when I did almost anything in the app: changed screens, edited data, deleted an event and the like. I’m hoping this is due to my satellite internet connection, because it was one of my biggest pain points with the Talli system. I will say I appreciated that there was no subscription component: Talli offers all its information and your data without any additional fees, whether you purchase the tracker or simply use the free app.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>The Talli device offers something that isn’t otherwise available: a hardware device dedicated to tracking everything you do with your child on a daily basis. It’s nicely designed, easy to use and has an app that charts and graphs the data for you. I liked using it a lot more than I expected to, given that tracking all my kids’ various activities through an app had become a bit of a chore. But using the Talli tracker wasn’t a chore — and having a physical device (even more, a single button) that I could tap and walk away from did indeed help me stay more consistent with tracking habits.</p><p>I only wish that I had found a better location for the device in my kids’ room — and I wish that the app didn’t lag so much — but otherwise I was pleasantly surprised at how well the Talli Tracker fit into my lifestyle. I can see it being particularly useful for those who have family or multiple caretakers tending to children or for people who prefer physical logging methods like calendars or notebooks.
