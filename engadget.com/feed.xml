So be thankful for the most underappreciated of your five senses, one that robots may soon themselves enjoy. Facebook announced on Monday that it has developed a suite of tactile technologies that will impart a sense of touch into robots that the mad doctor could never imagine.</p><p>But why is Facebook even bothering to look into robotics research at all? “Before I joined Facebook, I was chatting with Mark Zuckerberg, and I asked him, ‘Is there any area related to AI that you think we shouldn&#39;t be working on?’ Yann LeCun, Facebook’s chief AI scientist recalled during a recent press call. “And he said, ‘I can&#39;t find any good reason for us to work on robotics,’ so that was the start of our FAIR [Facebook AI Research] research, that we&#39;re not going to work on robotics.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Then, after a few years,” he continued, “it became clear that a lot of interesting progress in AI work is happening in the context of robotics because this is the nexus of where people in AI research are trying to get to; the full loop of perception, reasoning, planning and action, and then getting feedback from the from the environment.”</p><p>As such, FAIR has centered its tactile technology research on four main areas of study —  hardware, simulation, processing and perception. We’ve already seen FAIR’s hardware efforts: the DIGIT, a “<a href="https://research.fb.com/publications/digit-a-novel-design-for-a-low-cost-compact-high-resolution-tactile-sensor-with-application-to-in-hand-manipulation/"><ins>low-cost, compact high-resolution tactile sensor</ins></a>” that Facebook first announced in 2020. Unlike conventional tactile sensors, which typically rely on capacitive or resistive methods, DIGIT is actually vision-based.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f3834840-3802-11ec-b9ff-681af79cc27f" style="height:831;width:1920;" alt="DIGIT world view" data-uuid="e0465ced-9d61-3ee5-9df8-120d3d8745c0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAIR</div></figure><p>“Inside the sensors there is a camera, there are RGB LEDs placed around the silicon, and then there is a silicon gel,” Facebook AI Research Scientist, Roberto Calandra, explained. “Whenever we touch the silicone on an object, this is going to create shadows or changes in color cues that are then recorded by the collar. These allow [DIGIT] to have extremely high resolution and extremely high spectral sensitivity while having a device which is mechanically very robust, and very easy and cheap to produce.”</p><p>Calandra noted that DIGIT costs about $15 to produce and, being open source hardware, its production schematics are available to universities and research institutions with fabrication capabilities. It’s also available for sale, thanks to a partnership with <a href="https://gelsight.com/"><ins>GelSight</ins></a>, to researchers (and even members of the public) who can’t build their own.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3ca3ae20-3803-11ec-8fef-6beb27f1d131" style="height:1174;width:2080;" alt="digit egg" data-uuid="ca3d46fe-3e5e-3231-bb3d-6ab42a9506a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAIR</div></figure><p>In terms of simulation, which allows ML systems to train in a virtual environment without the need to collect heaps of real-world hardware data (much the same way <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-11-waymo-simulation-testing.html"><ins>Waymo has refined its self-driving vehicle systems over the course of 10 billion computer generated miles</ins></a>), FAIR has developed TACTO. This system can generate hundreds of frames of realistic high-resolution touch readings per second as well as simulate vision-based tactile sensors like DIGIT so that researchers don’t have to spend hours upon hours tapping on sensors to create a compendium of real-world training data.</p><p>“Today if you want to use reinforcement learning, for example, to train a car to drive itself,” LeCun pointed out, “it would have to it would have to be done in your turn environment because it would have to drive for millions of hours, cause you know countless thousands of accidents and destroy itself multiple times before it burns its way around and even then it probably wouldn&#39;t be very reliable. So how is it that humans are capable of learning to drive a car with 10 to 20 hours of practice with hardly any supervision?”</p><p>“It&#39;s because, by the time we turn 16 or 17, we have a pretty good model of the world,” he continued. We inherently understand the implications of what would happen if we drove a car off a cliff because we’ve had nearly two decades of experience with the concept of gravity as well as that of fucking around and finding out. “So ‘how to get machines to learn that model of the world that allows them to predict events and plan what&#39;s going to happen as a consequence of their actions’ is really the crux of the problem here.”</p><p>Sensors and simulators are all well and good, assuming you’ve got an advanced Comp Sci degree and a deep understanding of ML training procedure. But many aspiring roboticists don’t have those sorts of qualifications so, in order to broaden the availability of DIGIT and TACTO, FAIR has developed PyTouch — not to be confused with <a href="https://pytorch.org/"><ins>PyTorch</ins></a>. While Torch is a machine learning library focusing primarily on vision-based and NLP libraries, PyTouch centers on touch sensing applications.</p><p>“Researchers can simply connect their DIGIT, download a pretrained model and use this as a building block in their robotic application,” Calandra and Facebook AI Hardware Engineer, Mike Lambeta, wrote in a blog published Monday. “For example, to build a controller that grasps objects, researchers could detect whether the controller’s fingers are in contact by downloading a module from PyTouch.”</p><p>Most recently, FAIR (in partnership with Carnegie Mellon University) has developed ReSkin, a touch-sensitive “skin” for robots and wearables alike. “This deformable elastomer has micro-magnetic particles in it,” Facebook AI Research Manager, Abhinav Gupta, said. “And then we have electronics — a thin flexible PCB, which is essentially a grid of magnetometers. The sensing technology behind the skin is very simple: if you apply force into it, the elastomer will deform and, as it deforms, it changes the magnetic flux which is read [by] magnetometers.”</p><p>“A generalized tactile sensing skin like ReSkin will provide a source of rich contact data that could be helpful in advancing AI in a wide range of touch-based tasks including object classification, proprioception, and robotic grasping,” Gupta wrote in a recent FAIR blog. “AI models trained with learned tactile sensing skills will be capable of many types of tasks, including those that require higher sensitivity, such as working in health care settings, or greater dexterity, such as maneuvering small, soft, or sensitive objects.”</p><p>Despite being relatively inexpensive to produce — 100 units cost about $6 to make — ReSkin is surprisingly durable. The 2-3mm thick material lasts for up to 50,000 touches while generating high-frequency, 3-axis tactile signals and while retaining a temporal resolution of up to 400Hz and a spatial resolution of 1mm with 90 percent accuracy. Once a swath of ReSkin reaches its usable limits, replacing “the skin is as easy as taking a bandaid off and putting a new bandaid on,” Gupta quipped.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d2019860-3803-11ec-b67f-04daf414300e" style="height:432;width:768;" alt="ReSkin Berry" data-uuid="91b024d3-c6e5-3f9b-bbc8-a0188ef4b05e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAIR</div></figure><p>Given these properties, FAIR researchers foresee ReSkin being used in a number of applications including in-hand manipulation, ie making sure that robot gripper doesn’t crush the egg it’s picking up; measuring tactile forces in the field, measuring how much force the human hand exerts on objects it is manipulating, and contact localization, essentially teaching robots to recognize what they’re reaching for and how much pressure to apply once they touch upon it.</p><p>As with virtually all of its earlier research, FAIR has open-sourced DIGIT, TACTO, PyTouch and ReSkin in an effort to advance the state of tactile art across the entire field.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-enabling-a-new-generation-of-touchy-feely-robots-120016974.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">14a46530-1a30-4d24-87f7-365b1d958b37</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 12:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635435194</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T15:33:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/95bffc80-3802-11ec-bdfc-f316a562d4f3" width="4896" height="3264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/95bffc80-3802-11ec-bdfc-f316a562d4f3" width="4896" height="3264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[FAIR]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[FAIR's DIGIT]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[FAIR's DIGIT]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: So what is the metaverse?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So what <em>is</em> the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a>?

The technique uses higher writing speeds that might finally make it feasible to use the technology for archival and other purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>With 5D optical storage, each file is uses three layers of nanoscale dots. The dots&#39; size, orientation and position within the three standard dimensions, make up the five &quot;dimensions.&quot; The dots change the polarization of light travelling through the disc which is read using a microscope and polarizer.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-16-5d-discs-can-store-data-until-well-after-the-sun-burns-out.html">5D optical storage before</a>, but there were a number of problems — particularly the slow writing speeds that made the technology impractical. It has huge upsides for (extremely) long-term storage, though. It&#39;s been estimated that the storage medium could withstand temperatures up to 1,000 degrees C and last 13.8 billion years at room temperature without degrading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To overcome the speed problem, researchers used a femtosecond laser with a high repetition rate. Rather than writing directly in the glass, they used the laser to produce a phenomenon called near-field enhancement, that creates tiny structures using a few weak light pulses. Those can be used to enhance the circular voids generated by a more powerful, single-pulse &quot;micro-explosion.&quot; This technique &quot;minimized the thermal damage that has been problematic for other approaches that use high-repetition-rate lasers,&quot; according to the <a href="https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/fulltext.cfm?uri=optica-8-11-1365&amp;id=462661">paper</a>.</p><p>Using the new technique, the team was able to write 5GB of text data ono a silica glass disc the size of a conventional CD with nearly 100 percent readout accuracy. &quot;With the writing density available from the method, the disc would be able to hold 500 terabytes of data,&quot; the researchers said. They were also able to write at speeds or around a million voxels per second, or about 230 KB per second.&nbsp;</p><p>That might sound slow, but by introducing parallel writing, you could feasibly fill a 500TB disc in about 60 days. That could provide a way to backup reams of valuable data, essentially forever. &quot;With the current system, we have the ability to preserve terabytes of data, which could be used, for example, to preserve information from a person’s DNA,&quot; said research team leader Peter G. Kazansky.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/5-d-storage-could-fit-500-tb-on-cd-sized-disc-095039455.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03096616-3ca1-4cad-a66a-41f5f4c36fed</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 2021 09:50:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635769529</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T12:25:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/530e3000-3af5-11ec-b79d-a42610881822" width="1936" height="1243" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/530e3000-3af5-11ec-b79d-a42610881822" width="1936" height="1243" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Optica]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized glass disc]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['5D' storage could fit 500TB on a CD-sized glass disc]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's Nest devices are on sale at Best Buy ahead of Black Friday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you want to score Google&#39;s Nest devices at a discount before Black Friday arrives, check out Best Buy&#39;s sale — some of them are even available for the lowest price we&#39;ve seen them sell for across retailers.

Astronomers using NASA&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-07-spinning-black-holes-nasa.html">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> have <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/images/chandra-sees-evidence-for-possible-planet-in-another-galaxy.html">detected</a> what might be the first signs of a planet in another galaxy.  The team noticed dips in X-ray brightness that hint at a planet transiting in front of a star in the Messier 51 (aka M51) galaxy 28 million light-years away. For context, all the exoplanet candidates in the Milky Way are no more than 3,000 light-years from Earth — this planet would easily set a distance record if confirmed.</p><p>The very nature of stars made the feat possible. As the researchers had to focus on X-ray bright binary systems where the region of bright rays is relatively tiny, the transit was considerably easier to spot. Conventional detection of nearby stars requires much more sensitive light detection, as a planet might only block a small amount of light from a given star.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The planet itself is believed to be as large as Saturn, but would orbit its hosts (a star 20 times the mass of the Sun as well as a black hole or neutron star) at twice the distance.</p><p>Scientists didn&#39;t believe the dimming was due to gas clouds or dust, as those aren&#39;t consistent with the event they recorded in M51. A planet, however, would line up with the data.</p><p>The challenge, as you might guess, is verifying that data. The planet&#39;s large orbit could rule out another transit for roughly 70 years, and it wouldn&#39;t be clear exactly when astronomers would have to take a look. The three-hour transit of this planet candidate didn&#39;t provide a large window. That&#39;s also assuming the &#39;living&#39; star doesn&#39;t explode and bathe the planet in radiation.</p><p>If there&#39;s ever a confirmation, though, the discovery would be very significant. While there aren&#39;t many doubts that planets exist in other galaxies, it would be useful to have evidence of their existence. This could also significantly widen the scope of future planetary searches to include the galactic neighborhood, not just close-by stars.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/planet-outside-milky-way-galaxy-chandra-205310684.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0673993b-d822-47af-ae62-338999d414c1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 20:53:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635769549</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T12:26:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/912df6a0-3a86-11ec-b9fd-2227fc5ea543" width="1920" height="911" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/912df6a0-3a86-11ec-b9fd-2227fc5ea543" width="1920" height="911" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[X-ray: NASA/CXC/SAO/R.

Well-known leak purveyor Evan Blass has <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1454872863572365321">shared</a> what he said is an image of a 17-inch ThinkBook Plus model. Unlike the current 13.3-inch system, though, you wouldn&#39;t have to flip your machine around to use an e-paper display on the back. Instead, you&#39;d have a pen-capable color display next to the keyboard you could use to draw or take handwritten notes.</p><p>Blass didn&#39;t share other details, but the 17-inch ThinkBook Plus would seemingly have an extra-wide main display and fit in a full keyboard along with a large trackpad. We&#39;d expect reasonably speedy internals to help drive the second display, much like the vaguely comparable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zenbook-duo-review-2021-dual-screen-notebook-163024528.html">ASUS ZenBook Duo</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not certain when this extra-large ThinkBook Plus would ship.

Either way, the image suggests Lenovo hasn&#39;t given up on the Plus concept — if anything, it&#39;s exploring new concepts that might prove appealing for creatives and others who shied away in the past.</p><div id="f23aa06029144e818d588baf04b16d90"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have you guys seen this yet? 17-inch ThinkBook Plus from Lenovo... <a href="https://t.co/OElc5ZM3pb">pic.twitter.com/OElc5ZM3pb</a></p>— Ev (@evleaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1454872863572365321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-17-inch-thinkbook-plus-leak-195551383.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1936b642-ced3-488f-b8a0-16707de71129</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 19:55:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635710155</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T19:56:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d3169460-3a80-11ec-aedf-faa457db659a" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d3169460-3a80-11ec-aedf-faa457db659a" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Evan Blass, Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lenovo 17-inch ThinkBook Plus leak]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lenovo 17-inch ThinkBook Plus leak]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[G20 deal raises the minimum tax rate for big tech companies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Large tech companies may soon have to pay significant taxes no matter what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-30-eu-commission-apple-tax-ireland.html">tax loopholes</a> they had before. <em>BBC News</em><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-59101218">reports</a> G20 leaders have reached an agreement that would set a global minimum tax rate of 15 percent for large companies. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-09-g20-discuss-big-tech-tax-reform.html">long-in-the-making</a> deal should be official as of today (October 31st) and would be enforced starting in 2023.</p><p>The US originally pitched the concept to prevent companies from using creative accounting (such as the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement">Double Irish arrangement</a>&quot;) to avoid paying most of their taxes in the country. Other countries <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-22-germany-global-minimum-tax-large-tech-companies.html">embraced the idea</a>, though, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/oecd-head-defends-tax-deal-1.6232027">told</a><em>CBC News</em> the move could rake in about $150 billion from corporations around the world.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The deal could discourage tech giants like Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Netflix from relying on loopholes to maximize their profits.

Oxfam, for instance, <a href="https://www.oxfam.org/en/press-releases/oxfam-criticizes-lack-g20-bold-action-tackle-vaccine-inequality-climate-change-and">blasted</a> &quot;generous carve outs&quot; that protected sone income and take 10 years to phase out. The pro-equality group also claimed the deal was &quot;extremely limited&quot; and would affect fewer than 100 companies while generating little money for poorer countries. The arrangement might beat the status quo for G20 nations, but it won&#39;t necessarily address some outstanding concerns.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/g20-global-minimum-tax-rate-180620093.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9e8e845-fc60-4dc9-9ce0-8e0d2851aae5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 18:06:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635769599</ingested><modified>2021-11-01T12:26:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/47b09b20-3a6f-11ec-abdf-83e1da39acf5" width="8640" height="5760" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/47b09b20-3a6f-11ec-abdf-83e1da39acf5" width="8640" height="5760" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pool via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ROME, ITALY - OCTOBER 30: U.S. President Joe Biden, Democratic Republic of Congo's President and African Union Chair Felix Tshisekedi, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, from row from left, pose with other world leaders for a group photo at the La Nuvola conference center for the G20 summit on October 30, 2021 in Rome, Italy.

In his most recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claimed Apple is aiming for a headset that can handle &quot;high-quality&quot; VR games with both fast chips and high-res displays.

The main hiccups are simply the interface and streaming app selections — Google has a slight edge in both departments, but that might not matter much if you&#39;re mainly using voice commands or checking the news and weather.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-8-kindle-sale-142212659.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45c394b7-d10c-48d5-b6c8-65e53208a266</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 14:22:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635690135</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T14:22:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/6fcdac00-6bb3-11eb-beff-1423d5073ede" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/6fcdac00-6bb3-11eb-beff-1423d5073ede" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo (2020) smart speaker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo (2020) smart speaker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iRobot's poop-detecting Roomba j7+ vacuum is cheaper than ever right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>iRobot&#39;s latest Roomba that can detect obstacles — including pet poop — along its cleaning journey is cheaper than ever right now.

The AI-driven computer vision technology allows the device to detect obstacles and move around them as it cleans, and you can label those obstacles as permanent (in the case of a chair or another piece of furniture) or temporary. Not only does this mean the j7 robots should better navigate around things like piles of clothes and charging cords, but they can also detect a robot vacuum&#39;s arch nemesis: pet poop. iRobot even has a Pet Owner Official Promise (yes, P.O.O.P.) which states that you&#39;ll get a new robot vacuum if your j7+ runs into poop in the first year of you owning it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from that, the j7 series takes advantage of iRobot&#39;s improved mobile app, which lets you schedule cleanings and set routine triggers. You can also label rooms in your home after the robot has created a map, so you can better direct it to a specific room when you only need a quick clean.</p><p>While the clean base included in the j7+ package isn&#39;t necessary, it takes the convenience level up a notch. Instead of emptying your robot&#39;s bin after every job, the j7+ will automatically empty its contents into the clean base when it&#39;s done. You then only have to worry about emptying the base once every two months.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobots-poop-detecting-roomba-j7-plus-vacuum-is-cheaper-than-ever-right-now-123037360.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06add5ac-054c-4440-85ca-bb5f35c1b30a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 12:30:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635683164</ingested><modified>2021-10-31T12:26:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lego adds 'Luigi's Mansion' sets to its Super Mario World collection]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-super-mario-luigi-bowser-airship-110034682.html">Luigi is part of Lego Super Mario</a>, the toymaker is ready to show the other heroic plumber a little more respect. <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/newsroom/">Lego</a> has introduced a trio of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-28-luigis-mansion-3-nintendo-switch-review.html"><em>Luigi&#39;s Mansion</em></a> expansion sets that give its namesake star more to do in a game designed with him in mind.</p><p>The $30 Lab and Poltergust set helps you get started with Luigi&#39;s ghost vacuum, while a $40 Entryway set introduces you to the mansion proper as well as Polterpup and the  game series&#39; Boo ghosts.

The iFixit team said removing batteries from recent MacBook Pros required &quot;infinite patience, a bottle of isopropyl alcohol, and an optional bottle of human-friendly alcohol.&quot; They expected the same from this generation of laptops but were pleasantly surprised by the presence of pull tabs instead when they <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/54122/macbook-pro-2021-teardown">tore down</a> the new MacBook Pros.</p><p>The outer battery cells have noticeable pull tabs that you can, well, pull to detach them from their adhesive underneath. Even the central battery cells have pull tabs — they&#39;re just harder to find inside the laptop chassis beneath the trackpad. iFixit was able able to confirm that the laptops will recognize and work with battery replacements just fine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, most of the laptops&#39; ports, except for the SD card reader and the HDMI port, are modular. That means they can be easily and cheaply replaced if they suddenly break or malfunction.

Devindra Hardawar reviewed the latest <a href="https://amzn.to/3pPw0dV">14-</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3w4vauL">16-inch MacBook Pros</a> and reports back that they provide almost everything one could want out of a powerful laptop. Billy Steele spent time listening to the third-generation AirPods and concluded they sound much better than the previous version. And Cherlynn Low used Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro and found that the camera-heavy handsets have a lot more to offer, including a great starting price.</p><h2>The new MacBook Pros have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">ton of power (and ports)</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/86d0a220-38ec-11ec-a5b3-8a860be049ef" alt="Apple MacBook 14- and 16-inch (2021)" data-uuid="b1825893-d730-3e58-a67d-89d139389744"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar says the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:14-" href="https://amzn.to/3vZ88Wj">14-</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:16-inch MacBook Pros" href="https://amzn.to/2ZyVocC">16-inch MacBook Pros</a> are precisely what media professionals have been waiting for: speedy M1 Pro and Max processors, a comfortable keyboard, serious battery life and great speakers. They also feature most of the crucial ports MacBooks have been missing for years, including (finally!) an SD card reader, though the laptops are thicker and heavier as a result. And of course, all that comes with a high starting price of $1,999.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Devindra was particularly impressed by the Liquid Retina XDR displays, which come close to 4K resolutions, and have mini-LED backlighting to produce up to 1,600 nits of brightness. He was also pleased to find support for 120Hz refresh rates, and by the benchmark testing in which both MacBook Pros blew away competing Windows PCs. However, while the laptops were able to speedily convert a 4K video clip to 1080p, Devindra doesn&#39;t think they&#39;d make the best gaming machines — trying to load <em>Borderlands 3 </em>produced an unplayable mess. Overall though, he says these computers have practically everything one, especially a creative professional, would want in a powerful notebook — as long as you can stomach the price tag.</p><h2>The third-gen Airpods have a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">better fit and more features</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/11b916b0-38ed-11ec-bdd2-cd470a053d1c" alt="Apple AirPods 3rd-Gen (2021)" data-uuid="f6c7b56c-986d-3366-9ee0-114255c6ccff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Apple’s latest <a href="https://amzn.to/31jfWqF">AirPods</a> have been almost completely redesigned from the previous version; the buds themselves have a new look, courtesy of the contoured shape which reduces weight and features a tapered silhouette and an angle to increase comfort. Billy Steele says the company’s efforts to build better AirPods have paid off: the new buds are more comfortable and and have much better audio quality, with bigger and more immersive sound that remained open and airy. That’s thanks to a custom driver paired with a high-dynamic-range amplifier, as well as the new H1 chip and the inward facing mic. Billy says these changes made the AirPods something he actively wanted to listen to music with.</p><p>The new AirPods also have an IPX4 rating so they’ll survive sweaty workouts or small splashes. They can also detect skin which, combined with the built-in accelerometer, makes for more accurate pausing and extends battery life. The new chip means you can listen to tracks in Dolby Atmos on Apple Music, and the spatial audio is available with dynamic head tracking to change the position of the audio when you turn your head. However, the latest AirPods still lack active noise cancellation and Transparency mode as these features are still reserved for the pricier AirPods Pro. While Billy acknowledges that these earbuds aren’t for everyone, he says they continue to offer Apple users features that are well integrated with iPhone, iPad and Mac.</p><h2>Google’s Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">excellent phones with great prices</a>&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbc195f0-38ef-11ec-a9e2-fd44c6629b33" alt="Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro " data-uuid="df05aa6a-db9f-30d8-bcc6-522c84a7426a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low says the newest Google phones — the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bnGoRv">Pixel 6</a> and <a href="https://amzn.to/3mpn6l0">6 Pro</a> — are the most intriguing phones that the company has made in years. Featuring the first Google mobile processor, Tensor, the two handsets also have improved camera hardware, lovely OLED screens, speedy refresh rates (120Hz for the 6 Pro, 90Hz for the 6), and decent speakers. Cherlynn says the best feature is the surprisingly low starting price — only $599 — which makes some of the drawbacks more forgivable.</p><p>One of the issues she had with the phones was the laggy under-screen fingerprint sensor, which requires the display to be on before it unlocked — a process that she says doesn’t need to have two steps. She was more impressed by the new voice keyboard, which did an excellent job of transcribing speech, and the additional camera features. The sensors are sharper and bigger with larger pixels, producing bright, clean photos — and special camera features, like Magic Eraser and Face Unblur, give users a lot of control over their photos. The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro excelled in our battery tests, too, lasting 20.5 hours and 17 hours, respectively. Overall, Cherlynn calls the handsets a superb return to form, showing off Google’s strengths in the software and photography departments.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-apples-new-macbook-pros-have-nearly-everything-youd-want-160049252.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">634b1803-994b-413e-9fbe-b22038c853a8</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 16:00:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635539639</ingested><modified>2021-10-29T20:34:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a961-350a-11ec-aeed-d392d87d8e2c" width="2000" height="1241" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fc26a961-350a-11ec-aeed-d392d87d8e2c" width="2000" height="1241" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro 14-inch (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's worst shipping delay is for a $19 polishing cloth]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You&#39;d think <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canalys-smartphone-shipments-q3-2021-190214915.html">global supply shortages</a> would hit Apple&#39;s tech products the hardest, but that&#39;s apparently not the case.

Jason Rubin, the company&#39;s VP of Metaverse Content has <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/within-to-join-meta/">revealed</a> that Meta is <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/meta-acquires-vr-fitness-subscription-service-supernatural/">acquiring</a> Within, the creator of immersive virtual reality workout app <em>Supernatural</em> for Oculus Quest headsets. A rep for Within previously described <em>Supernatural</em> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/supernatural-vr-workout-app-beat-saber-chris-milk-130014895.html"><em>Engadget</em></a> as &quot;part <em>Beat Saber</em>, part <em>Dance Dance Revolution</em>, part <em>Guitar Hero</em> with your whole body.</p><p>In a separate <a href="https://cdn.getsupernatural.com/images/Leanne_Letter_v7_Mobile.png">announcement</a> (via <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/29/meta-facebook-is-buying-within-creators-of-the-supernatural-vr-fitness-app/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>), Within CEO Chris Milk and Head of fitness Leanne Pedante said that its coaches, choreographers and managers will continue being part of the team. They&#39;ll work on VR fitness experiences for <em>Supernatural</em> independently under Meta&#39;s Reality Labs. While Within will have to answer to its new parent company going forward, Milk&#39;s and Pedante&#39;s statement says the the acquisition will give them access to more resources, including more music, more features and more social experiences.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In <em>Supernatural</em>, you&#39;ll have to hit colored orbs flying at you from its various VR environments using your controllers.

Now, the social network has <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/supporting-covid-19-vaccine-children/">expanded</a> those policies and its COVID-19 vaccination efforts to include kids shortly after the FDA authorized the emergency use of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children ages five to eleven.</p><p>In the coming weeks, it will send in-feed English and Spanish reminders to users in the US that the COVID-19 vaccine is now available for kids. Those reminders will also include a link that&#39;ll help users find the nearest vaccination site. Perhaps, more importantly, it will expand its anti-vaccine misinformation policies to remove claims that COVID-19 vaccines for kids do not exist and that the vaccine for children is untested. It will also remove any claim that COVID-19 vaccines can kill or seriously harm kids, that they&#39;re not effective for children at all and that anything other than a COVID-19 vaccine can inoculate children against the virus.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook says its fight against vaccine misinformation is part of an ongoing effort in partnership with the CDC, WHO and other health authorities. It promises to keep on updating its policies and ban any new claim about the COVID-19 vaccine for children that will emerge in the future. The website, which now operates under its parent company Meta, says it has removed more than 20 million pieces of content from Facebook and Instagram since the beginning of the pandemic. As of August 2021, it has also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-removed-3000-accounts-covid-vaccine-misinformation-184254103.html">banned</a> 3,000 accounts, groups and pages for repeatedly breaking its health misinformation policies.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2ee2f800-3956-11ec-bff7-fcb2b54aac31" style="height:816;width:890;" alt="Facebook" data-uuid="105a1b8d-1be1-3fa8-8e5f-4cd41fc68d3c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-covid-19-vaccine-misinformation-kids-074628334.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d659aef6-0438-4288-a11d-518943cbddb4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 30 Oct 2021 07:46:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635580313</ingested><modified>2021-10-30T07:51:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/76b6d7f0-9cda-11eb-9eff-6687443ff0d5" width="5617" height="3745" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/76b6d7f0-9cda-11eb-9eff-6687443ff0d5" width="5617" height="3745" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roberto Jimenez Mejias via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Female doctor giving covid-19 vaccine to a boy]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
