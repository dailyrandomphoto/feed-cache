Researchers hope that analysis of data such as mobility, sleep patterns and how people type could spot behaviors associated with those conditions, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-wants-iphones-to-help-detect-depression-cognitive-decline-sources-say-11632216601?mod=djemalertNEWS"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>.</p><p>Other measurements could include facial expression analysis and heart and respiration rates. All of the processing would take place on the device, with no data sent to Apple servers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is working on research projects that could lead to the development of these features. The University of California, Los Angeles, is studying stress, anxiety and depression, with Apple Watch and iPhone data for 3,000 volunteers being tracked in a study that starts this year. A pilot phase that began in 2020 recorded data from 150 participants.</p><p>Researchers will compare data captured from iPhone and Watch sensors with questionnaires participants fill out about how they feel, according to the report. They&#39;re also said to be measuring the level of the stress hormone cortisol in participants&#39; hair follicles. Apple and UCLA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ucla-depression-study-225118236.html"><ins>announced the three-year study</ins></a> in August 2020.</p><p>Another research project is underway that may factor into this Apple project. The company and pharmaceutical firm Biogen <a href="https://investors.biogen.com/news-releases/news-release-details/biogen-launch-pioneering-study-develop-digital-biomarkers">said</a> in January they&#39;re working on a two-year study to monitor cognitive function and perhaps spot mild cognitive impairment, which has the potential to develop into Alzheimer’s. The plan is to track around 20,000 participants, around half of whom have high risk of cognitive impairment.</p><p>If data from the studies lines up with symptoms of depression or anxiety, Apple could use it to create a feature that warns users if it sees signs of a mental health condition. The iPhone could prompt users to seek care, which could be important as early detection can improve quality of life in the long run.</p><p>Apple and its partners are in the early stages of this work, so it&#39;ll likely be a few years at least before the company adds mental health monitoring features to the iPhone. There&#39;s no guarantee the research will lead to such features at all.</p><p>Some previous studies have indicated people with certain conditions use devices differently than other folks. It&#39;s not yet clear whether developers can build algorithms that can detect mental health conditions reliably and accurately.</p><p>Still, there&#39;s no smoke without fire. Health has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html"><ins>a growing focus</ins></a> for Apple over the past few years, so there&#39;s a chance features based on this research will eventually emerge.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-mental-health-condition-detection-iphone-report-171343401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9cefbd62-f9f4-4e28-b943-73d54a49f3d1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:13:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632244425</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T17:13:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mental Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fea35d90-1afd-11ec-97f7-1b3a5b5e1ccb" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fea35d90-1afd-11ec-97f7-1b3a5b5e1ccb" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM details the motors that will power its electric Hummer and other EVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>General Motors has spent a lot of time recently talking up the capabilities of its upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html">Ultium battery technology</a> but has said significantly less so about the motors those cells will power. That changed on Tuesday when the company detailed its new <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2020/sep/0916-ultium-drive.html">Ultium Drive motors</a>. With today’s announcement, the series consists of three different models: a 180 kW front-drive model, a 255 kW rear- and front-drive variant and a 62 kW all-wheel drive assist motor. The first two models are permanent magnet motors GM designed in such a way so as to try and reduce its dependence on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nissan-rare-earth-metal-recycling-process-181124555.html">heavy rare metals</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The company didn’t speak to the specific torque and power density characters of each motor but claimed they should deliver “excellent” performance on those fronts. It also revealed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gmc-hummer-ev-reveal-001354369.html">2022 Hummer EV</a> will feature three of the 255 kW models. GM claims they will enable the vehicle to produce a combined 11,500 ft/lb of torque and accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in approximately three seconds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>GM says its engineers designed the motors with scalability in mind. Each one can be made using similar tools and manufacturing techniques. It also found a way to integrate components like the power inverter directly into the motors, a feat the company said should reduce costs and simplify manufacturing.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gm-ultium-drive-motors-announcement-170022093.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d1bc663d-6cef-4e26-b8a4-71953dc73ded</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:00:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632241430</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T16:24:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/45ecf6b0-1af5-11ec-bff7-085c7773b84c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/45ecf6b0-1af5-11ec-bff7-085c7773b84c" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[General Motors]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[General Motors]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[General Motors]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook introduces portable Portal Go for $199]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-15-facebook-portal-review-2019.html">Facebook’s Portal devices</a> have proven surprisingly popular over the past year, largely due to the pandemic and our dependence on video calls. It’s no surprise, then, that the company is doubling down on the concept. Today, Facebook is announcing two new Portals: an updated Portal+ for $349, plus a brand new $199 Portal Go that is also the company’s first-ever portable smart display.</p><p>Yes, in brief, that means the Go can actually be taken out of its charging dock and toted around. There’s also an integrated handle on the back for easy carrying. Despite the handle, it has a relatively compact form factor, with a 10-inch, 1,280 x 800 display housed inside a soft fabric-wrapped enclosure.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The idea behind this portable Portal, according to Facebook, is that you can keep the device in, say, a kitchen or an office, and it can then be moved around the house if the family is congregating in a different room. Of course, since it’s portable, it can also be brought outdoors as long as you have a relatively strong WiFi signal. Since it can stream music from sources like Spotify, you can also use the Go as a portable speaker.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/200ac590-1806-11ec-b7ff-f5dc57afcf76" alt="Portal Go" data-uuid="dcd3f13d-7af1-38ab-a1d1-e329022642e4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>As for battery life, Facebook says that you will likely get up to five hours of one-on-one Messenger calling on a single charge and up to 14 hours of music playback if the screen is off.</p><p>In addition, the company unveiled a new Portal+, which hasn’t been updated since the original debuted in 2018. While we thought the first-gen model was a bit of an eyesore, the new Portal+ brings a much-improved design. With a 14-inch, 2,140 x 1,440 display, it still has the largest screen out of all the Portals, but its footprint is much smaller than before. The Portal+ display can also be tilted up and down to accommodate different heights.</p><p>Both the new Portals have a 12-megapixel camera with an ultra-wide field of view. Like the other Portals, these make use of Facebook&#39;s so-named Smart Camera technology, which uses AI to follow you around the room, panning and zooming to keep you in frame the entire time. There’s also a smart sound tech that allows you speak at a normal volume, regardless of the distance between you and the device, and still have your callers hear you clearly.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, with any Facebook product, privacy and security are obvious concerns. To help allay those fears, both the new Portals have built-in camera lens covers, and there are buttons at the top that disconnects the camera and the microphone. The smart camera AI technology mentioned earlier runs locally on the device and not on Facebook’s servers. WhatsApp calls are end-to-end encrypted by default. On <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-e2ee-voice-video-calls-group-instagram-164140952.html">Messenger,</a> however, you’ll have to specify the contacts and groups you want to enable the end-to-end encryption (and even this feature is still in the roll-out phase).</p><p>Aside from new hardware, Facebook also detailed some incoming software updates. One of them is Household Mode, which essentially lets you share the Portal with the whole family. In Household Mode, you can allow access to a selection of shared apps and contacts, while keeping the rest personal. For example, then, you can let the whole family use apps like Messenger and WhatsApp, and allow them to call grandma and grandpa, but they won’t be able to contact anyone else unless you let them. You can set up a screen lock passcode to control access to the device as well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5d84fdf0-1806-11ec-bfed-68b238d81835" alt="Portal+ home screen" data-uuid="9686e760-e8dd-3756-a591-6f6d25a97339"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>The Portal home screen has also been redesigned to be more personalized, with a top row of favorite contacts, and a card interface similar to the one on other smart displays. There’s a card for Messenger Rooms, one for Spotify playlist shortcuts, another for most used apps, and more. As for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-facebook-portal-tv-review.html">Portal TV</a>, the company will soon be updating it so that you can see calling notifications like a pending Rooms invitation or a missed video call.</p><p>Additionally, Facebook has updated the Watch Together experience on Portal so it can be used not just on Portal-to-Portal calls, but also with Messenger pals on the phone, laptop or tablet. On top of that, the company says it’s bringing WhatsApp multi-device support to Portal in the next few months. This lets you use WhatsApp on your phone as well as four non-phone devices at the same time.</p><p>Facebook is aware that Portals can be used not just in the home context, but also for business purposes. That’s why it will be adding support for Microsoft Teams for all Portal devices starting this December. (It added support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-zoom-workplace-140020249.html">Zoom, WebEx, BlueJeans and GotoMeeting</a> last year.) There will also be a new Calendar app, which lets you view your Outlook or Google calendar on Portal. The beauty of this is that you could then jump in on your next meeting with a single tap on the screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bdc111e0-1806-11ec-af7e-1031e867704c" alt="Portal+ and Portal Go" data-uuid="938f8aef-5739-38ff-96e5-5bf89a89df7f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>In addition, Facebook is introducing Portal for Business specifically for small businesses to deploy and manage Portal devices. They can create and manage Facebook Work Accounts which lets employees use company email addresses to set up the Portal. IT admins can use a Portal Device Manager to manage the devices remotely.</p><p>According to Facebook, the 8-inch Portal Mini will be discontinued, but the Portal TV and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-15-facebook-portal-review-2019.html">2019 10-inch Portal that requires a power cord</a> will still be available.&nbsp;</p><p>Pre-orders for both the Portal Go and the new Portal+ start today. They will begin shipping October 19th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-portals-go-170004952.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0ce41249-7886-4c91-b179-46f07bf92784</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 17:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632227902</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T12:38:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b2733300-1805-11ec-b77b-d96fafb1090f" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b2733300-1805-11ec-b77b-d96fafb1090f" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Portal+ and Portal Go]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Portal+ and Portal Go]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dynamic head tracking is now available in Apple Music]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-ipados-15-watchos-8-iphone-ipad-watch-release-170601389.html">iOS 15 release</a> brings an added treat if you&#39;re a fan of immersive audio: a better soundstage for your tunes.

Those who have been eager to get their hands on one of these VR headsets can now get two at one of the best prices we&#39;ve seen. Through September 27, Oculus is running a deal that <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:knocks $100 off a second Quest 2 headset" href="https://fave.co/3fdK4b4">knocks $100 off a second Quest 2 headset</a> when you buy one at full price. That means you can get two of the 128GB models for $500, or two of the 256GB versions for $700.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3fdK4b4" id="13154a36cdce481dba30170ff4d3c02c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Oculus;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Quest 2 bundle at Oculus - $500</a><p>Oculus improved its machine in nearly every way with the Quest 2, and the device ultimately earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">score of 89</a> from us. The headset itself is 10 percent smaller and more comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, although it does take a bit of fiddling to properly adjust its fit for your head. Powered by a Snapdragon XR2 processor, the Quest 2 includes fast-switching LCDs with a resolution of 1832x1920 per eye, and although it didn&#39;t launch with this, it will support 90Hz refresh rates. Its controllers are larger than before but still easy to hold, and they include a bit more space next to the gamepad buttons so you can rest your thumbs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The slight design changes and the better processor help make the Quest 2 an improvement on its predecessor in nearly every way. It excels at being both a standalone and a desktop headset, delivering more realistic VR experiences. It does have some limitations when it comes to standalone games, mostly due to its mobile hardware, but that&#39;s to be expected. Also, you must sign in with a Facebook account to use the Quest 2, which is also to be expect, but nevertheless a bummer for those who don&#39;t use the social network.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-buy-one-get-100-off-second-headset-deal-144032642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3fb4e3e-e174-490e-9223-3111b1504ef7</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 14:40:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632235125</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T14:38:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/1253d755-f82e-11ea-bbcd-685027325f42" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/1253d755-f82e-11ea-bbcd-685027325f42" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marvel shows are now available through Apple Podcasts subscriptions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel">Marvel</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/siriusxm">SiriusXM</a> have opened a new Apple Podcasts channel, which includes a paid tier.

Instead, the e-bike has become the preserve of those that can afford one. A decent conventional bike already costs a bit, so adding a motor understandably only adds to that cost. Enter <a href="https://tenways.com/">Tenways</a>, a new player in the e-bike world that’s trying to buck that trend. Its debut model, the CGO 600, is currently <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tenways-ebike-the-best-urban-ride-ever#/">available on Indiegogo</a> for around $1,400 and despite its relative affordability, it doesn’t scrimp on features.</p><p>Now, the usual disclaimer: With Indiegogo and other crowdfunding platforms, there’s always an inherent risk. But Tenways states its production is already underway and given that the review model they sent appears to be full and final hardware we were somewhat assured that things are ready to go.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The CGO 600 is clearly a city bike with its thinner tires and classic diamond frame. It’s powered by a 250W battery which is discreetly hidden in the downtube, to the point where it’s almost impossible to tell that this bike is electric at all. The rear hub motor is visible, but also small enough to not catch the eye. That motor offers a max assistance speed of 15mph in Europe or 20mph in the US which are the maximum allowed in those territories. The claimed range is around 80 miles per charge (though this seems optimistic) and it’s all bundled into a package that weighs around 15 kilograms (around 33 pounds).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4bd71050-1ad3-11ec-9ef3-666ec5dca701" alt="Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review." data-uuid="21ca3241-a96f-3be9-949b-dea398dab02a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Beyond the key specs, the motor uses a torque sensor for fast, smooth acceleration with three levels of assistance. The bike has no gears, so the motor acts as either regular assist or can be used <em>like </em>gears when going uphill. The brakes are hydraulic for easier maintenance and the carbon belt transmission should mean no oily fingers or pit stops to set it back in place. The CGO 600 can be fully charged in about 2.5 hours, and there’s a small LCD display that acts as an onboard trip computer and power button.</p><p>I won’t lie, the specs were pretty impressive at this price point, but what initially drew me to the CGO 600 was the understated design. While it looks great in all the five colorways, there’s something about the black and green model that looks stealthy. The fact that it doesn’t scream “e-bike” makes it feel less of a lure for thieves and just all round makes for an attractive object. In many ways it reminds me of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-03-cowboy-electric-bicycle-battery-review.html">the Cowboy</a> (€1,990 or roughly $2,198) but with a little less aggressively modern design.</p><p>Your first task will be putting the bike together, but it’s not too much of a challenge and I was all set and done in less than an hour with a tea break and work interruptions along the way. Once you have it together, you can download the companion app if you wish (it’s not essential unlike on the Cowboy) and get out there on the road.</p><p>There are two frame sizes on offer are 50cm (19 inch) and 54cm (21 inch) with no step-through option if that’s your preference or if the available sizes are too big for you. I’m a fairly average height and find the 50cm version I tested to be comfortable. The riding position is a little forward-leaning, but not in a way that bothered me.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6730b630-1ad3-11ec-bdd3-8d4f8595d557" alt="Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review." data-uuid="a4c28197-d248-39cf-9e2e-1d18aae16620"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>The very first thing you’ll notice is both how fast to engage and how smooth the motor is. When at a standstill at stoplights, it only takes a fraction of a second for the assistance to kick in. It’s smooth enough that it’s not jarring but powerful enough for you to instantly feel the benefit. Once you’re up to speed, it sometimes feels like the assistance isn’t really helping as much, but you only have to turn it off and have the bike in manual mode for a few seconds before your thighs remind you you’re running on your own steam.</p><p>It’s when you’re going uphill that you’ll really feel the benefit. The torque sensor means that the amount of assistance immediately responds to the intensity of the ascent. I found that even on fairly steep inclines I didn’t need to get up off the saddle; just fire up the highest level of power and work the pedals.</p><p>The torque sensor is also magnetic rather than pressure-based, meaning you can happily ride the CGO 600 entirely on your own leg power without any resistance or burden from the motor. This is great if you’re worried about it being less useful if the battery runs out.</p><p>About that: Tenways’ claim of 80 miles of assistance per charge is hard to gauge. I certainly haven’t ridden 80 miles on it yet. But on one full charge I’ve covered just over 22 with 58-percent battery remaining. On a crude calculation, that means I am on track for about 45/50 miles on a single charge. That’s much less than the advertised 80, but I also really enjoy the full power assist, so if you only rode on level one, you’d likely eke more miles out of it. Either way, 50 miles or so would cover a 5-mile commute back and forth over a week without charging.</p><p>It’s worth mentioning that there’s no throttle mode here. That’s fairly typical of e-bikes in this style, but in case you were hoping for it, now you know. That said, if you press and hold the down button on the odometer, the bike will creep along on its motor, but it’s only about three miles an hour, so more of a gentle start or a lane splitter’s tool than anything like a motorbike mode.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ae50df40-1ad3-11ec-8bfb-d7efe256accd" alt="Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review." data-uuid="697b105b-3158-3ca1-a42d-1431d6c648cd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>In keeping with the stealthy looks, that motor makes nary a sound. It’s not <em>entirely</em> silent, but certainly you’re not going to hear it while riding around town. I love that the hub motor is barely visible and that the battery is so well hidden. Though, of course, that does mean there’s no option to buy spares/swap them out. But it also means you can breeze past serious cyclists on their racers while barely breaking a sweat and enjoy their curious glances as you do so.</p><p>One last comment on how it rides: It’s definitely not an off-road bike. That is fairly obvious from the design, but worth mentioning. The CGO 600 lives for asphalt. I took it over some less friendly terrains (potholes, gravel and a decked pathway) and while it handled it all fine, the suspension is pretty hard so you’ll feel every teeth-clattering bump.</p><p>The onboard computer is useful but simple. The default screen has everything you need to know at a glance (speed/battery/distance etc.). Then there are sub-screens that are accessible with a  tap for more detailed information like average speed and range. This is also where you can add some security via a passcode for the motor. This obviously doesn’t prevent someone stealing your bike, but it’s a small deterrent perhaps?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/def93b60-1ad3-11ec-b6df-8e9415cd8efd" alt="Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review." data-uuid="fd0d64fe-08b4-3a0e-8e6f-576eb909985c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>At only 15kg, the CGO 600 is definitely one of the lighter e-bikes in this style. Lighter than both the Cowboy (16kg) and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-04-vanmoof-electrified-s2-electric-bike-hands-on.html">VanMoof Electrified S2 </a>(19kg, $2,298). This makes it a more manageable option if you need to lug it up stairs or, like me, man-handle it into an elevator each time you want to head out. It also makes manual mode a little easier on the legs should you prefer to go on human power (or if the battery runs out).</p><p>On a more practical note, Tenways included an integrated front light that&#39;s bright enough for those darker sections of your nighttime city commute. How it fares in more rural settings is likely a different matter. There’s also a rear light included, but it’s an accessory you attach with its own battery, so something you’ll need to check regularly if you don’t want to get caught out.</p><p>The humble city e-bike has evolved greatly in the last few years, but still needs a little push to bring it into the mainstream as a viable commuting option. Companies like Cowboy, VanMoof and Brompton have been chipping away at the remaining resistance points and now Tenways is here to show you can take most of the features from those models and package them in a more pocket-friendly way. The $1,400 price will likely go up once the Indiegogo campaign ends, but expect it to remain competitive even at retail prices.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tenways-cgo600-preview-143051234.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b50d19e5-b0d9-46ff-a6e0-db59a796a67d</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 14:30:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632234030</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T14:20:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c1bd8480-1ad2-11ec-a9fd-116250cc3ec9" width="1905" height="1179" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c1bd8480-1ad2-11ec-a9fd-116250cc3ec9" width="1905" height="1179" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tenways CGO 600 e-bike review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tumblr’s Post+ subscriptions are available to anyone in the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tumblr is opening its paid subscription features to more users. Post+, the subscription offering it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-paid-subscriptions-post-plus-automattic-164124106.html"><ins>introduced</ins></a> in July, is moving into an open beta, the company announced. Until now, only a handful of creators had access to Post+, but with the next phase of the rollout, any US-based blogger can start experimenting with subscription-backed content (Tumblr says it plans to make Post+ available in more countries later this year). For now, Post+ allows bloggers to offer subscriptions at $2, $4, $6 or $10 a month, though creators can continue to offer a mix of free content as well.</p><p>With the update, Tumblr is joining an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html"><ins>increasingly crowded</ins></a> field of companies hoping to lure users with the promise of subscription revenue. But the company is hoping it can carve out a niche among younger users eager to experiment with the kind of creative — and often <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahmarder/ridiculously-weird-tumblr-posts"><ins>deeply weird</ins></a> — content the blogging platform has long been known for.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“This is not reserved for professionals,” Tumblr’s Head of Product, Lance Willet, tells Engadget. “On other places — [when] I think of either Patreon or Substack, you gotta kind of start with your content and then go out and find people. We are flipping that around and saying: you already kind of have a niche, why not just start asking for people to become a supporter.”</p><p>What’s less clear is if the Tumblr user base will be willing to start paying for content they used to get for free. Just hours after the company first announced plans for Post+ in July, the company posted a message to its <a href="https://staff.tumblr.com/post/657366672276176896/tumblr-earlier-today-we-announced-to-the-press"><ins>staff blog</ins></a> decrying the “targeted harassment and threats” creators were facing over their participation in the initial Post+ beta. But Willet says the company has also seen a large amount of interest from users who want to try the tools out. Post+, he says, is for anyone with a niche on Tumblr, from Gen Z “meme lords and shitposters,” to artists and podcasters and bloggers. “People can have five followers, or 15 or 500 — it doesn’t matter.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-post-plus-expansion-140056311.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f15fc265-4f70-4ad2-838c-5d61f8aac3fd</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 14:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632181150</ingested><modified>2021-09-20T23:39:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a166d7d0-1a6a-11ec-b3e7-4e158f9f351c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a166d7d0-1a6a-11ec-b3e7-4e158f9f351c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tumblr]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tumblr's monetizations features are open to all in the US.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[tumblr Post+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Comcast makes its affordable broadband available to low-income undergrads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Comcast has expanded <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-08-06-comcasts-internet-essentials-offers-10-internet-access-to-low.html">Internet Essentials&#39;</a> coverage to include <a href="https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants/pell">Federal Pell Grant</a> recipients within areas where it&#39;s available.

That ecosystem just became much more affordable if you have a computer, however. <a href="https://www.akaipro.com/press">The company</a> has introduced an MPC Studio controller built solely to tie in with MPC 2 software on your Mac or PC. Plug it in and you can produce tunes with the signature 16 drum pads (with pressure, velocity and aftertouch control) as well as an assignable touch strip that lets you twist instruments and synths. A color LCD helps keep your focus on the controller when you&#39;re chopping samples or fine-tuning effects.</p><p>The software, unsurprisingly, plays a key role. Akai has been pouring much more of its energy into its MPC 2 software, including a <a href="https://www.gearnews.com/akai-mpc-2-10-massive-update-adds-14-plug-ins-and-pitch-correction-to-desktop-and-hardware/">large update</a> in July that added AIR plugins and on-device pitch correction. You&#39;ll have access to eight plugin instrument engines as well as sampling, MIDI sequencing, arranging and other parts of the MPC workflow. Think of the MPC Studio as Akai&#39;s answer to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-03-24-ableton-push-review.html">Ableton&#39;s Push</a> — it&#39;s hardware that brings out the software&#39;s full potential.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The MPC Studio is available today for $269. You&#39;ll still need MPC 2 (normally $200, currently $100), but it&#39;s still a relative bargain so long as you have a production-ready computer. This could make Akai&#39;s universe considerably more accessible if you&#39;re new to this kind of music making.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-studio-controller-140007968.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">88ea3177-419e-4d42-95cb-4b90db93b155</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 14:00:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632231305</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T13:35:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5701da00-1ad8-11ec-bfbc-43382c7df4ac" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5701da00-1ad8-11ec-bfbc-43382c7df4ac" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Akai]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Akai MPC Studio controller linked to a MacBook Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Akai MPC Studio controller linked to a MacBook Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 and 13 mini review: A subtle upgrade that's all about the cameras]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="dabcd0a0f767428991f6dee8384a5ad8"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cd2mbWJS3aQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>On paper, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-specs-price-release-date-174459983.html">the iPhone 13</a> and 13 mini aren&#39;t much to get excited about. Apple&#39;s subtle refinement on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">iPhone 12 models</a> will be familiar if you&#39;ve paid attention to developments in the Android world. Some of the changes are impressive, like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-mini-annoucement-175051051.html">bringing the iPhone 12 Pro Max&#39;s excellent camera hardware to smaller phones and lower price points</a>. Others, like a slightly smaller notch, bigger batteries, brighter displays, faster chips and expanded 5G support feel incremental. Still, they add up to make the iPhone 13 mini and iPhone 13 feel like worthwhile upgrades, especially to those looking to upgrade from older iPhones.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>If you’re coming from an iPhone 12 or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-mini-review-cameras-battery-life-002700754.html">12 mini</a>, you might not notice a huge difference in this year’s models. The physical refinements include a smaller notch, a rearranged camera module that protrudes slightly further than before along with a new pink color option. I <em>adore</em> this hue — it’s similar to the “Not Pink” shade Google used on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-15-google-pixel-3-pixel-3-xl-review-android-pie.html">the Pixel 3</a>, but because of the glass covering the iPhone, it looks paler and more iridescent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple shaved 20 percent off the front camera notch, which is nice, but it’s still significantly larger than the punch-hole designs over in Android land. The smaller size also didn’t make a huge difference in daily use. Of course, that notch houses hardware for Face ID, which is more sophisticated than any punch-hole camera at the moment. Given there isn’t a fingerprint sensor on current iPhones, a beefier face-recognition system is warranted and I guess we’ll just have to put up with the notch until Apple can figure out a better approach.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2487e970-1a9c-11ec-9fdd-7a2e61c7e295" alt="A green iPhone 12 and pink iPhone 13 with their backs facing the camera. You can see their dual cameras. On the left, the pair of sensors are stacked on top of each other. On the right, they&#39;re laid out diagonally. The module on the right is also slightly wider and taller, and the cameras themselves are slightly bigger." data-uuid="6ae5cc3c-5d62-32e7-9c10-c53ae98ea06e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>The main way to tell the iPhone 13 and its predecessor apart is by looking at the camera module. Instead of stacking the pair of lenses vertically, Apple laid them diagonally. The bump is also a little bigger and thicker and the extra wobbling this causes is mildly annoying. Also, this does mean your old iPhone 12 cases won’t fit.</p><p>Otherwise, the iPhone 13 and 13 mini are physically very similar to last year’s models. They both feature anodized aluminum and glass frames with flat edges with what Apple calls its “ceramic shield” covering the front.</p><p>Both the iPhone 13 and 13 mini are a hair heavier and thicker and have the same display sizes as before at 6.1-inch and 5.4-inch respectively. The iPhone 13 is heavier than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html">the Galaxy S21</a>, too, despite having a smaller screen. Though, its density, glass covering and shiny metal edges do make it feel more premium.</p><h2>Display and audio</h2><p>Unlike <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html">the iPhone 13 Pros</a>, which have faster 120Hz screens, the iPhone 13 and 13 mini have similar displays to their predecessors. Apple says the panels are 28-percent brighter. When I set the iPhone 12 and 13 to max brightness and held them up on a cloudy day, I did notice the newer phone had a <em>teensy</em> bit of an edge. But the difference isn’t big enough that you’d know without having them side by side.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d9c17f40-1a9c-11ec-a7fe-48c24f72b711" alt="A black iPhone 13 mini and pink iPhone 13 standing in front of some books on a shelf, with their rears facing the camera." data-uuid="e86fedf7-e436-30ce-9db0-6ff3437eaa45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Besides that, the iPhone 13’s screens haven’t changed much. The thing is that just about everywhere else you look, though, phone displays are faster. I had been using the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 before reviewing the iPhone 13, and even Google’s 90Hz panels make browsing Twitter and Reddit feel smoother.</p><p>If you’ve only used a 60Hz screen so far, you might not feel like you’re missing much — the iPhone 13’s display is still vibrant and crisp. You’ll enjoy watching Instagram or TikTok videos, for sure. But as someone who’s experienced the <em>good stuff</em>, I can tell you that you’re missing out.</p><p>As for the iPhone 13’s speakers, they’re basically unchanged and are good enough to hear the voices in your favorite creators’ clips or the background music of YouTube videos. In a pinch, they’ll even do a decent job streaming your favorite songs, offering clear vocals and adequate bass. As expected, though, the bigger iPhone is louder and has a fuller sound than the mini.</p><section data-eng-breakout="8060db32f426485ba9ee6c7e29bb99de" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/faa6ab90-1a9c-11ec-b4d7-57fcd5c37c64" alt="A pink iPhone 13 nestled in a planter with its rear cameras facing us."></section><h2>Cameras</h2><p>The bulk of the iPhone 13 and 13 mini’s upgrades are around photography and video. Apple improved both the rear sensors here and the ultrawide lens is supposed to let in more light than before. Sadly, a lot of the notable additions are contingent on the A15 chipsets, meaning things like Cinematic Mode won’t be coming to older iPhones.</p><p>For example, the faster image signal processor (ISP) on the chip means things like nighttime photos won’t take as long. I certainly didn’t have to hold the iPhone 13 still for as many seconds as the iPhone 12 when I used both of them to shoot a candlelit globe in a super dark room. The difference was probably about one second, which sounds insignificant, but can feel like forever when you’re struggling to remain motionless.</p><p>The ultrawide photos I shot with the new phone were actually darker than the iPhone 12’s, but they were better exposed overall. Buildings against the night sky had cleaner lines, less noise and a more neutral tone than those from the iPhone 12. Google’s Night Sight on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">the Pixel 5</a> still rendered more details in the shadows, though, and I preferred the cooler images it produced.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1f42ec70-1a9d-11ec-bbb2-7ce8373cec4b" alt="Photographic styles on the iPhone 13" data-uuid="652d0bcf-2a38-3746-9df8-e3faa7667b7c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>I used to prefer photos from Pixels because Apple’s pictures had a yellowish tinge. But with the iPhone 13s, Apple is introducing a way to better match users’ individual preferences called Photographic Styles. It’ll let you choose from one of five profiles: Standard, Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm and Cool, which differ in contrast levels and color temperature.</p><p>You can tweak these modes to your preference, too. But at their original settings, my favorite Style was Vibrant. Unlike filters, this felt more like a set-and-forget kind of thing — nice for people like me who have never been into Apple’s default treatment. Overall, the iPhone 13 took colorful and crisp shots, though compared to Google’s images they were needlessly brighter with obvious HDR effects.</p><p>In addition to the hardware and software improvements I’ve already mentioned, the company also updated its HDR algorithm to better accommodate every person in the scene. It also worked to enhance video quality, promising better dynamic range, details and highlights. Plus, you can now record in Dolby Vision in 4K resolution at up to 60 frames per second.</p><p>But the most intriguing new video feature (and arguably of all the camera updates) is Cinematic Mode. Using the A15 chip’s neural engine, the iPhone 13 can create a Portrait mode-like effect in your clips, keeping your selected subjects in focus while blurring out the rest of the scene. You can tap on parts of your viewfinder to change focal points as you shoot or let the iPhone decide for you by analyzing who and what’s in the scene.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/48836100-1a9d-11ec-969f-352c696d4e45" alt="Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13" data-uuid="14e351dc-dfc1-38bf-80e0-dc8eca243b45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>On its own, Apple’s system is pretty clever. The iPhone 13 did a great job of identifying faces (both human and canine) in my shots, and yellow or white boxes appeared to indicate potential things to focus on. As my subjects turned toward and away from the camera, they became clearer and blurrier respectively. But when I tried to exert more control and adjust the focal point, the system struggled. Sometimes, my intended subject remained blurry even after I tapped on its rectangle. Other times, the iPhone didn’t follow the person I selected after they walked behind an obstruction, though that’s a reasonable situation.</p><p>When it did perform as expected, Cinematic Mode produced a pleasant effect that gave videos a professional air. But at the default intensity, the blurriness looked strange or artificial. The outline of my colleague’s head was stark against the softened background and I had to adjust the F-stop to the highest (f/16) to get a more natural feel.</p><p>It’s worth noting that Cinematic Mode only works in 1080p at 30 frames per second, even if you’ve set your camera to record at a higher quality.</p><p>Cinematic mode is also available via the 12-megapixel selfie camera, which offers Photographic Styles too, and both features were just as effective via the front sensors as through the rear.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f3dc8fcc-6ed7-4dd9-ba82-5238ee93d825"/><p>In low light, the iPhone 13 took selfies that were slightly blurry compared to the Pixel 5 and Galaxy S21, but when I was well lit, Apple’s camera delivered images that were just as sharp as the competition. It even had a more neutral tone than the other two, with a more accurate white balance (though Samsung was pretty close).</p><h2>iOS 15</h2><p>I covered most of the changes coming via iOS 15 when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html">I tested the beta</a>, including things like Focus modes and SharePlay. Focus modes, which lets you set custom home pages and notification profiles based on your location or time of day, is still one of the most useful new features on any smartphone platform in recent years. Meanwhile, SharePlay won’t be available until a later release.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcc02040-1a9d-11ec-b679-b593aac40b57" alt="An iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 next to each other with their screens facing the camera." data-uuid="0d3b3232-2d48-35ee-9cfd-deb1d2471b09"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Each time you open a relevant app, like Photos or Tips, Apple shows you what’s new this time around — like Memories set to tunes from the company’s Music library. Safari also had a redesign (and a few tweaks during the beta window), primarily making it easier to browse and organize your tabs.</p><p>I’ve never been a big Safari user, preferring Chrome for its convenience, but it’s nice to see Apple update its interface for easier navigation with one hand. Chrome and Safari are pretty similar on iOS, although Google sadly still has its address and search bar at the top of the screen. If you prefer, you can also go back to the traditional layout in Safari.</p><p>Other noteworthy iOS updates include Live Text in Photos, which makes finding specific pictures from the Spotlight search much easier. The Maps and Weather apps also received a refresh, while Shared With You in Messages makes it slightly easier to find things you and your friends chatted about. Since most of these will be coming to older iPhones, though, iOS 15 features are unlikely to sway your decision on whether to upgrade this year.</p><p>We’ll have a more in-depth review of Apple’s latest OS soon, but for now, I’m pleased with the level of control iOS 15 offers and look forward to testing out a stable version of SharePlay.</p><section data-eng-breakout="8227b9ca170e46be9c25f9b7803eb6f1" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9349aeb0-1a9d-11ec-a7ef-e9f4d7e00ada" alt="A pink iPhone 13 slightly off angle, with its rear facing the camera."></section><h2>Performance and in use</h2><p>There are some annual updates that we take for granted nowadays, like imperceptibly faster processors and incrementally improved battery life. Though it’s not obvious, Apple says one of the iPhone 13’s key updates is an internal redesign that allows for a bigger battery, among other things. Also new in the A15 are the GPU, ISP and video encoder and decoder, which made using the camera super snappy. Oh, and it’s worth pointing out that Apple doubled the storage of the base iPhone 13, so you now get 128GB at the entry-level. <em>Finally</em>.</p><p>I spent most of my time on the iPhone 13 and 13 mini shooting pictures and video, browsing my feeds, shopping for completely unnecessary things, messaging my friends and completing round after round on the New York Times Crossword app. Every now and then, I had to wait for a page to load on the mini, while the bigger phone rarely lagged. I can’t tell if the delays I encountered had to do with my internet connection or if the smaller device was actually slower. Their scores on Geekbench 5 are about the same, so I suspect it was the former. Overall, though, both the iPhone 13s sped through tasks like launching and switching between multiple apps, snapping photos in rapid succession and uploading Instagram posts.</p><p>Frankly, the main thing holding both models back is the display. As mentioned, pretty much every other flagship phone has a faster screen now, and even the Pixel 5’s 90Hz panel feels noticeably faster. Whenever I reflexively started scrolling my list of Instagram Story viewers or Twitter timeline or pretty much anything on the internet, it felt like a drag on the new iPhones. I went right back to the Pixel 5 or iPhone 13 Pro any time I knew I was going to spend a long time scrolling.</p><h2>Battery life</h2><p>Despite their brighter screens, Apple said the iPhone 13 and 13 mini should last up to 2.5 and 1.5 hours longer than their predecessors respectively. While the 13 mini did beat the 12 mini by sticking around almost a whole day on light use, the 13 hours and 19 minutes score on our video rundown test is still shorter than the average smartphone. It’s a pity; I love the size of the iPhone 13 mini — it’s just so much easier to use with one hand. But the greatest drawback of any modern phone this small is a lack of endurance.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2b629a40-1a9e-11ec-af7e-7c48791d7ea9" alt="A pink iPhone 13 on a mustard-colored couch with its rear facing the camera." data-uuid="d671fcc3-0c02-33d6-8e05-3af69df2b3bb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>The iPhone 13, meanwhile, outlasted its predecessor and generally hung around for almost two days. The Pixel 5 and Galaxy S21 also clocked similar runtimes — it’s nice that most flagships these days have fairly long-lasting batteries. I&#39;m still running our full battery tests across all of the new iPhones, including the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max, and will update this review with comparative figures shortly.</p><h2>Wrap up</h2><p>This is a story we’ve told over and over again, each time with the same conclusion: While this year’s iPhones aren’t major improvements over their predecessors, they offer just enough changes that might tempt you to upgrade, particularly if you’re still on an iPhone 11 or older. The iPhone 13 and 13 mini feel like they should have been called the 12s and 12s mini, thanks to a largely similar design and few major upgrades from the previous models. If you have an iPhone 12, you need to decide if the longer battery life and photography updates are worth however much the upgrade will cost you. Our review of the 13 Pro and Pro Max is coming later this week, so you can check that out to see if things like the faster displays and macro photography features would be worth picking up one of those.</p><p>As for how Apple’s latest compare to recent Android flagships, you’ll find they’re all almost on par when it comes to hardware. The biggest difference is the faster screens on Androids, and those who prefer fingerprint sensors to Face ID will only find them on non-Apple phones. Those are good reasons to stick with Android. But on software, Apple’s thoughtful approach with Focus modes and privacy on iOS makes it appealing to those who want greater control over how much of their lives they want to give up to their phones. Switching ecosystems will always be a struggle, and with the iPhone 13 and 13 mini, Apple has yet to give people a compelling reason to do so. But, as expected, they’re excellent phones with little to complain about.</p><p></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs (iPhone 13)</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic with 6-core CPU</p><p><strong>Storage</strong>: 128/256/512GB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Display</strong>: 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED with HDR</p><p><strong>Display resolution</strong>: 2,532 x 1,170 (460 ppi)</p><p><strong>Rear dual cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.6 wide-angle camera with sensor-shift OIS; 12MP f/2.4 ultra-wide camera (120-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Front camera</strong>: 12MP f/2.2 TrueDepth camera</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: iOS 15</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: &quot;Up to 19 hours video playback&quot;</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: Lightning port with fast wired charging at 20W (up to 50 percent in 30 minutes); Support for MagSafe wireless charging up to at 15W; Qi wireless charging at up to 7.5W.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 5.78 x 2.82 x 0.30 inches; 146.7 x 71.5 x 7.65mm</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 174 grams; 6.14oz</p><p><strong>Fingerprint sensor</strong>: No</p><p><strong>Waterproofing</strong>: IP68</p><p><strong>NFC</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Headphone jack</strong>: No</p></div><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs (iPhone 13 mini)</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: A15 Bionic with 6-core CPU</p><p><strong>Storage</strong>: 128/256/512GB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Display</strong>: 5.4-inch Super Retina XDR OLED with HDR</p><p><strong>Display resolution</strong>: 2,340 x 1,080 (476 ppi)</p><p><strong>Rear dual cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.6 wide-angle camera with sensor-shift OIS; 12MP f/2.4 ultra-wide camera (120-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Front camera</strong>: 12MP f/2.2 TrueDepth camera</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: iOS 15</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: &quot;Up to 17 hours video playback&quot;</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: Lightning port with fast wired charging at 20W (up to 50 percent in 30 minutes); Support for MagSafe wireless charging up to at 15W; Qi wireless charging at up to 7.5W.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>: 5.18 x 2.53 x 0.30 inches; 131.5 x 64.2 x 7.65mm</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 141grams; 4.97oz</p><p><strong>Fingerprint sensor</strong>: No</p><p><strong>Waterproofing</strong>: IP68</p><p><strong>NFC</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Headphone jack</strong>: No</p></div><p>Photos by David Imel (<a href="https://twitter.com/DurvidImel">@DurvidImel</a>)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">05d73a96-dac2-4fbc-95fb-a534e53a1ef4</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 13:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632227392</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T12:29:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/de2e6bc0-1a9b-11ec-bef7-5c6aa1cb549c" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/73f8c710-1ad6-11ec-b7dd-264bb5d27314" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13 and 13 mini.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 and 13 mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's new Kindle Paperwhites have bigger, brighter screens and USB-C charging]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As indicated in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-next-kindle-5-may-come-in-a-signature-edition-with-more-storage-101549272.html">a leak earlier this week</a>, Amazon is updating the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Kindle%20Paperwhite">Kindle Paperwhite</a>. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:fifth-gen Paperwhite" href="https://amzn.to/3AxDJ2O">fifth-gen Paperwhite</a> (which marks the first refresh in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-13-kindle-paperwhite-review-2018.html">nearly three years</a>) has a larger, 6.8-inch display, compared with the previous model&#39;s six-inch screen. The company says the 300 ppi screen is glare-free and looks like real paper, which allows for &quot;easy reading in all conditions, even direct sunlight.&quot;</p><p>The screen is 10 percent brighter than the previous model at the maximum setting and there&#39;s a white-on-black dark mode. Amazon has redesigned the interface and page turns are said to be 20 percent faster. The Paperwhite has an IPX8 rating, which means it&#39;s water-resistant but not dust-resistant.

The Kindle Paperwhite Kids is largely the same as the other two models in terms of design, though there are a bunch of child-friendly features. For one thing, there&#39;s a two-year worry-free guarantee. If it breaks in that time, Amazon will replace it.</p><p>There&#39;s audiobook and Bluetooth headphone support, as well as achievement badges and educational tools to foster literacy skills. The kids model, which is designed for readers aged seven and older, doesn&#39;t have internet access or any way for children to accidentally make any purchases. Their folks can manage the device using the Parent Dashboard.</p><p>Kindle Paperwhite Kids has funkier color options than the other two devices, which only come in black. You can opt for that plain, ol&#39; color or choose Emerald Forest or Robot Dreams patterns. You&#39;ll get a one-year subscription to Amazon Kids+ too, which includes access to thousands of books.</p><p>Amazon says all three models will run for up to 10 weeks on a single charge. The devices now support USB-C fast charging. With a 9W or larger charger, you&#39;ll be able to fully top up the battery in two and a half hours, Amazon says.</p><p>The $140 Kindle Paperwhite comes with 8GB of storage. The $190 Signature Edition has 32GB of storage, which should come in handy if you&#39;re an avid audiobook listener. Amazon is bundling in four months of Kindle Unlimited access for a limited time.

Among those is the rollout of its Stories-style feature, which will let users share <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-huddles-audio-143014019.html">audio, video and screen recordings</a> in channels and direct messages. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-video-stories-anytime-audio-connect-dms-130051370.html">said last October</a> it was experimenting with the idea.</p><p>Rather than sharing snippets from your life or whatever&#39;s on your mind (as you might on Instagram Stories), <a href="https://slack.com/digital-hq">Clips</a> is more about sharing work updates. You might use them to share a briefing so colleagues in other timezones can catch up later, or to offer some feedback on a project without having to type out all of your thoughts. Clips could help teams avoid trying to find a time that everyone&#39;s available for a meeting and instead let folks watch recordings when it best suits them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Slack says it designed the feature with inclusivity and accessibility in mind. Along with changing the playback speed, you can read live, automated captions. You can also use a transcript to skip the preamble and get to the parts of the recording that truly matter, and respond to a Clip with text, audio or video. Unlike Stories on other platforms, Clips won&#39;t automatically disappear and the transcriptions will be searchable.</p><p>Slack is rolling out Clips now. The feature should be available to all paid teams this fall.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/79830260-170f-11ec-bf77-1d84c5422f66" alt="Slack Connect" data-uuid="2883b2e8-f8df-31b9-a3e7-91538a0e9d49"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Slack</div></figure><p>One of the other things you can do with Clips is share them with people outside of your team through Slack Connect. That feature lets users interact with external partners and customers, and the company has some news on that front too. With Slack Connect sponsored connections, Enterprise Grid teams will be able to invite anyone else into channels, even if they aren&#39;t paid users.</p><p>Until now, only organizations on paid plans have been able to work in channels together through Slack Connect. (All users can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/slack-connect-dm-change-190737764.html">DM each other</a> regardless of what plan they&#39;re on.) The company suggests sponsored connections, named so because Enterprise Grid plans cover the cost of Connect, will help teams move forward with partners and customers faster. Enterprise Grid teams will have access to the feature this fall.</p><p>Elsewhere, Slack announced a version of the app for the public sector called GovSlack, which is designed to meet government security needs and certifications. GovSlack will be available next year. In a major surprise, the company is also <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2021/09/21/new-salesforce-and-slack-innovations-empower-companies-to-build-their-digital-hq">working on</a> deeper integration with Salesforce products.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/slack-clips-stories-connect-salesforce-120010885.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">488c2d4b-a99b-4758-9fa2-0904cc6e56e6</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 12:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632235582</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T14:46:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-06/054c59d0-9374-11e9-a99b-8886349246c6" width="5003" height="3095" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-06/054c59d0-9374-11e9-a99b-8886349246c6" width="5003" height="3095" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Slack Technologies Inc. logo is seen at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) during the company's IPO in New York, U.S. June 20, 2019.

These minors will now be limited to just 40 minutes of use per day and can’t access the app at all between 10 PM and 6 AM.</p><p>ByteDance is also urging parents to add in more comprehensive user data to avoid kids lying about their age to get around the ban. At the same time, the company unveiled a new TikTok-esque app called Xiao Qu Xing (&quot;Little Fun Star&quot;), which offers short educational videos.</p><p>This is another fairly dramatic move as part of China’s broader crackdown on digital media and video games. Officials have recently described gaming as “spiritual opium” and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-cuts-kids-gaming-time-132539606.html"><ins>limited kids playtime to just three hours a week</ins></a>.</p><p>Chinese leaders are reportedly concerned that children are becoming addicted to video games, which is having a detrimental effect on their development. The science behind video game addiction is controversial and disputed, with research into the condition ongoing.</p><p>Either way, the changes to Douyin aren’t likely to be that wide ranging in isolation since it’s thought that less than half a percent of users are under 14. It’s just the overall trend that’s likely to be worth keeping an eye on, especially if this anti-game rhetoric spreads to other countries.</p><p>— Dan Cooper</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikeas-pad-can-give-your-desk-wireless-charging-powers-with-no-clutter-072405388.html"><strong><ins>Ikea&#39;s new $40 wireless charging pad mounts underneath your desk or table</ins></strong></a></h2><h3>No more drilling or unsightly charging plates on your table, desk or nightstand.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikeas-pad-can-give-your-desk-wireless-charging-powers-with-no-clutter-072405388.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d8976940-1abf-11ec-bbdf-5ebbce75549e" style="height:314;width:675;" alt="Image of IKEA&#39;s new under-desk charger." data-uuid="2cfee52a-c81a-3879-b045-14456b4e6894"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure></a><p>When I added an Ikea-branded wireless charging plate to my Ikea nightstand, I had to buy a custom Ikea hole saw to drill through into the top.

You can also just delete individual recommendations by pressing on the item and selecting &quot;Remove.&quot; Take note that the section doesn&#39;t show up until you get at least one recommendation, and it will disappear the moment you delete the last item in the list.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-personalized-recommendations-podcasts-104032273.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b6b7396-c639-4482-a384-1deeeea77d74</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 10:40:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632217019</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T09:37:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/47d99830-1ab8-11ec-bd79-af060cd2659a" width="1600" height="1020" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/47d99830-1ab8-11ec-bd79-af060cd2659a" width="1600" height="1020" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat's new lenses and stickers can teach you basic sign language]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/snap-augmented-reality-spectacles-selfie-drone-190800775.html">Snapchat</a> is rolling out new augmented reality lenses and stickers that can give you cursory lessons on sign language. The company has developed the new features as part of its efforts for the Weak of the Deaf with guidance from its Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing team members. Its new AR Lenses use AI and computer vision technology by <a href="https://www.signall.us/">SignAll</a>, which can recognize and translate American Sign Language.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the lenses will teach you how to fingerspell, in which you form individual letters with your fingers to spell a word. The other new lenses will teach you how to fingerspell your username, as well as some common words like &quot;love&quot; and &quot;smile.&quot; You can scan the Snapcodes below to access them and then share a clip of you signing on the app.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b8a98220-1aa7-11ec-ae1f-3d11d7bea298" style="height:290;width:800;" alt="Snap" data-uuid="bafc1686-046c-31b7-ad51-f6a5c8bac2f1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Snap</div></figure><p>In addition to the new lenses, Snap has also launched new general, Bitmoji and Cameos selfie stickers with common signs. The hope is that these new elements can boost awareness and help more people learn a new way to communicate. Jennica Pounds, a deaf software engineer at Snap who was a key figure in the project said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;A big motivation for me is my own oldest son, who absolutely loves to talk, but has had a hard time learning ASL. I&#39;m passionate about this technology because I truly believe it&#39;s going to break so many applications wide open.

That&#39;s considerably faster than what SD UHS II can do (burst read/write speeds up to 300MB/s), though slower than CFexpress Type B (1,750MB/s read and 1,000MB/s write).

They have reason to be concerned, according to a new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457521003791?via%3Dihub#!">MIT study</a> seen by <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/mit-study-finds-tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-autopilot-is-activated/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. The researchers studied glance data and found that drivers become more inattentive when using Tesla&#39;s Autopilot system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Visual behavior patterns change before and after [Autopilot] disengagement,” according to the study. “Before disengagement, drivers looked less on road and focused more on non-driving related areas compared to after the transition to manual driving. The higher proportion of off-road glances before disengagement to manual driving were not compensated by longer glances ahead.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Visual behavior patterns change before and after AP disengagement. Before disengagement, drivers looked less on road and focused more on non-driving related areas compared to after the transition to manual driving. The higher proportion of off-road glances before disengagement to manual driving were not compensated by longer glances ahead.</p></blockquote><p>The fact that drivers may not pay as much attention to the road when using Autopilot is not exactly a shocker. What&#39;s new is that the researchers were able to see exactly where drivers were looking when the autopilot was engaged versus when it&#39;s disengaged.</p><p>Off-road glances were directed downwards and toward the center stack region, so they &quot;were presumably non-driving related.&quot; Rather, looking in those directions is typically associated with activities like glancing down at a smartphone or interacting with the center-stack infotainment touchscreen. Those were often longer with Autopilot engaged and far more frequent than off-road glances in manual driving, according to the paper.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the name, Tesla&#39;s FSD (full self-driving) Autopilot is merely a driver assist system and far from being fully autonomous. As such, it requires that drivers keep their hands on the wheel and remain fully alert, but Tesla doesn&#39;t use cameras or other means to monitor the alertness part.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">latest version</a>, 10.0.1, supposedly makes more confident decisions on the road, but has so far only rolled out to a relatively small group of beta testers. Tesla plans to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/20/the-station-gogoro-scoots-into-a-spac-a-rivian-milestone-and-tesla-prepares-to-unleash-fsd-beta-software/">roll it out more widely</a> starting September 24th, though, and may release it to all Autopilot FSD EVs, pending a seven day trial that will track owner behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>The new release could pit Tesla against US regulators, however. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) head Jennifer Homendy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ntsb-head-on-tesla-full-self-driving-safety-170443851.html">recently said</a> that Tesla shouldn&#39;t release the latest software update until it can address &quot;basic safety issues.&quot; She also wasn&#39;t thrilled with Tesla essentially beta-testing upgrades on public streets.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-drivers-become-inattentive-when-using-autopilot-study-finds-072247148.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f4e39b2-59d2-4ac5-90a2-8ab7f96eb53a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 07:22:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632208971</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T07:23:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/062d14b0-1aa0-11ec-b4fd-b0aa89d2b72d" width="2270" height="1329" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/062d14b0-1aa0-11ec-b4fd-b0aa89d2b72d" width="2270" height="1329" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla drivers become 'inattentive' when using Autopilot, study finds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla drivers become 'inattentive' when using Autopilot, study finds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix debuts free tier for Android users in Kenya]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-and-apple-tv-clean-up-at-the-emmys-with-the-crown-and-ted-lasso-053901458.html">Netflix</a> has <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-launches-free-plan-in-kenya">started offering</a> potential paying subscribers in Kenya access to some of its content at no cost. The streaming service has launched a free tier in the country that offers around one-fourth the content available to paying subscribers. It has no ads and won&#39;t even ask for payment information upon sign-up — a new subscriber will only need to confirm they&#39;re over 18 and to type in their email address and password.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it does have limitations in addition to having a smaller selection: It&#39;s only accessible on an Android device and users won&#39;t be able to download episodes for offline viewing or to cast shows on movies to a TV. In the announcement post, Netflix&#39;s Director of Product Innovation Cathy Conk, said: &quot;If you’ve never watched Netflix before — and many people in Kenya haven’t — this is a great way to experience our service.&quot; The company is hoping that the free tier would entice people to pay for the service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Netflix made some of its content free to access. Last year, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-free-original-content-collection-125616221.html">launched</a> a &quot;watch free&quot; page where people can stream original movies such as <em>Bird Box</em> and the first episodes of popular shows like <em>Stranger Things</em> without even having to log in. The free plan is new, though, and a spokesperson told <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/global/netflix-free-streaming-plan-kenya-1235069573/"><em>Variety</em></a> that it&#39;s launching first in Kenya as a way for the company to gather information on how effective it is in generating paying customers. Netflix has been investing more heavily in new markets to offset its slowing growth in the US and other saturated markets and amidst an increasing number of rival streaming services. Based on what the rep said, we may see the free tier make its way to more regions in the future.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-free-tier-android-kenya-043616484.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3646f197-281a-4257-8186-b00ad29d6534</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 04:36:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632226166</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T12:09:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a04777f0-1ad4-11ec-9f9d-fab1eb8ee56e" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a04777f0-1ad4-11ec-9f9d-fab1eb8ee56e" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/08/27: In this photo illustration the Netflix logo seen displayed on a smartphone.
