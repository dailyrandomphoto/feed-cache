Among the models the company is updating are its popular Stealth GS77 and Stealth <a href="https://www.engadget.com/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-180001632.html">GS66 laptops</a>. New to the 2022 versions of the laptop is a more durable zinc alloy hinge. They also feature larger trackpads and keycaps for a more comfortable typing experience. Between the Stealth GS77 and Stealth GS66, MSI will offer 10 different configurations.</p><p>With the latter, the most affordable model will cost $1,799 and feature an Intel Core i7-12650H processor, NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU, 16GB of RAM and 1TB of NVMe storage. It also comes with a 17-inch 360Hz Full HD display. If you want MSI’s most powerful GS77 model, you’ll need to set aside $4,199. That gets you a computer with a 14-core, 20-thread i9-12900H; NVIDIA’s new flagship laptop GPU, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3070-ti-3080-ti-laptop-gpu-ces-announcement-163355552.html"><ins>RTX 3080 Ti</ins></a>; 32GB of RAM; and a 1TB M.2 drive.

The Core i9 Stealth GS77 will come with a metal pad that melts when the computer reaches a temperature of 136 degrees Fahrenheit. The liquid fills the space between the CPU and thermal block, leading to a more efficient transfer of heat, according to MSI.

Back then, it said that its technology — which combine land-based sensors and GPS — was accurate to around 2.5 cm, or 0.9 inches.

This, combined with the aforementioned GPS technology, enables it to maintain its position within a geofence around an individual field.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e68ebe10-6d92-11ec-bfc9-8d25f75f9894" alt="Image of the sensor bay on top of John Deere&#39;s autonomous tractor" data-uuid="b83433f0-91b5-36d4-8920-512ca81ee349"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">John Deere</div></figure><p>The model that Deere is showing off combines a Deere 8R Tractor, a TruSet-enabled chisel plow and the secret sauce contained within its navigation technology. It says that all a farmer needs to do is drive it to the start of a field, configure it for autonomous operation and then “swipe from left to right to start the machine.” Its progress can then be monitored from a mobile device, which can receive live video, data and metrics, allowing a farmer to adjust speed and drill depth from their phone.</p><p>We don&#39;t yet know how much the hardware is going to cost, but we can imagine that there will be plenty of interest from major farming companies both in the US and abroad as they look to cut costs on labor and search for efficiencies any way that they can.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/john-deere-autonomous-tractor-203054726.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8296e139-092a-4582-83c9-37941b370f1f</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:30:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641324488</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T19:28:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c8b87f70-6d92-11ec-a9fb-6af0c229cf19" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c8b87f70-6d92-11ec-a9fb-6af0c229cf19" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[John Deere]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of John Deere's Autonomous Tractor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[John Deere Autonomous Tractor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft and Qualcomm are building custom chips for AR glasses]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Qualcomm&#39;s involvement with Microsoft is extending past <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-8cx-gen-3-7c-gen-3-arm-chipsets-windows-gaming-handheld-230008247.html">chips for PCs</a>.

And that was before we learned it would cost $1,500 with the 3080, and that it <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/asus-rog-xg-mobile">wasn&#39;t nearly as fast as reviewers would have liked</a>. At the very least, the Z13 promises to be a better performer than the X13 with its built-in hardware, so maybe an eGPU would be unnecessary.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In person, the Z13 is exactly what you&#39;d expect from an ROG gaming laptop to look like. The preview unit ASUS sent for me to borrow felt dense and sturdy, surprisingly so for its 12 millimeter thickness. Unlike iPads and other tablets, it feels strong enough to survive a backpack commute without a protective case. From the front, you could easily mistake it for a notebook. From the sides and back though, it&#39;s more like a Super Surface, with a flexible kickstand and keyboard cover.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a80-6c41-11ec-bfdf-5bdcc1ffcee2" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13" data-uuid="21df3f12-a124-3d12-9bd9-639827bf1196"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>I wasn&#39;t able to run any games and benchmarks on the ROG Z13, unfortunately. (I&#39;d wager ASUS&#39;s software and drivers aren&#39;t ready for serious testing yet.) But I could see why it could be compelling: An RTX 3050 Ti in a machine this size would be a dream for travel (at least, when that&#39;s safe again). And its 4K 13-inch display was perfectly fine for productivity tasks (there&#39;s also a 1080p 120Hz option). Given its size, though, the Z13 felt too heavy to use as a standard tablet. It&#39;s also not nearly as &quot;lappable&quot; as the Surface Pro devices; it&#39;s just too heavy to stay put while you&#39;re typing.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a82-6c41-11ec-aa7f-cd1bdc13a6cc" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13 keyboard" data-uuid="c1f4e5f1-5b26-3cc8-b0b5-09f303cfc6c8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>ASUS deserves credit for actually including the keyboard case with the Z13, something Microsoft still refuses to do with the Surface Pro. And the typing experience actually feels pretty decent, so long as the Z13 is planted firmly on a flat surface. I could see it being a solid option for casual gaming, but the WASD inputs don&#39;t feel nearly as responsive as a basic desktop gaming keyboard. Basically, if you&#39;re expecting to compete while using the Z13, plan to bring along a separate keyboard.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c9f9e1b7af754c33a58b8217c31ad57b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a81-6c41-11ec-bbdf-8d13a34be0a3" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13 from the side"></section><p>You&#39;ll likely be able to connect most of your accessories to the Z13 as well, since it includes both a USB 2.0 Type-A connection, as well two USB 3.2 Type-C ports (one is hidden under the XG Mobile connection. There&#39;s also a microSD card slot, which is useful for throwing in additional storage or offloading media.</p><p>Without knowing the ROG Z13&#39;s price and testing it properly, it&#39;s hard to make any final judgements. Personally, I think most consumers would be better off investing in a gaming notebook, which would have bigger screens, faster hardware and more capable keyboards. But ASUS already makes plenty of those, including our beloved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-190037967.html">Zephyrus G14</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g-15-review-2021-gaming-laptop-150044817.html">G15</a>. The Z13, which is expected to land in the first half of 2022, is clearly meant for gamers who prioritize portability more than anything else. For them, this might be the tablet of their dreams.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-flow-z13-gaming-tablet-nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-200004888.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c13b8ba1-22f3-44c4-b115-6281f1ef272d</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641326677</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T20:04:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a80-6c41-11ec-ab3f-034430a27c9b" width="2000" height="1268" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0a345a80-6c41-11ec-ab3f-034430a27c9b" width="2000" height="1268" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Flow Z13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Flow Z13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ASUS' ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop finally gets a webcam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:ASUS&#39; gaming laptops" href="https://fave.co/3EWmut4">ASUS&#39; gaming laptops</a> have caught up to the work-from-home era. The PC maker has unveiled its ROG laptop line for early 2022, and the centerpiece for many is likely an updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-190037967.html">Zephyrus G14</a> (shown above) that finally, finally includes a webcam — one with Windows Hello-friendly infrared, no less. ASUS told Engadget gamers didn&#39;t mind the absence of a camera in the past, but a combination of shrinking panels and smaller cameras made the inclusion possible. Whatever the reasoning, this will be welcome for anyone who had to forego the G14 (or buy an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-10-logitech-4k-pro-magnetic-webcam-for-pro-display-xdr.html">external webcam</a>) to participate in virtual classrooms and meetings.</p><p>There are plenty of performance-related upgrades, of course. The reworked Zephryus G14 uses AMD&#39;s new Ryzen 6000-series chips (up to the Ryzen 9 6900HS), a maximum 32GB of DDR5 memory and dedicated Radeon graphics up to the RX 6800S. Cooling has improved, too, thanks to a new vapor chamber, liquid metal on the CPU and GPU, a dust filter and higher-airflow fans. You&#39;ll also find slimmer overall display bezels, a 50 percent larger trackpad and a flashier mini-LED lid with 19 percent more lights and smoother animations. It&#39;s too soon to say if the G14 will match ASUS&#39; claims of 10-plus hours of video playback on battery, but USB-C fast charging and reduced GPU thermal design power (from 100W to 65W) should minimize the amount of time you need to plug in.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>ASUS hasn&#39;t divulged pricing for the Zephyrus G14 as of this writing, but you&#39;ll have options for 144Hz 1080p and 120Hz 1440p screens, and you can spring for more frugal components like the Ryzen 5 6600HS or Radeon RX 6700S to keep costs down.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/249bf360-68cc-11ec-a6ea-ade70177c978" alt="ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 16 gaming laptop" data-uuid="ca240f0f-55bd-32f4-a239-8a59074d0366"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p>There are other laptops in store. The new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review-150003509.html">Zephyrus Duo</a> 16 (pictured at middle) builds on the dual-screen concept with some unique display tricks. If you spring for the 120Hz 4K main panel, you can switch to 1080p at 240Hz thanks to a clustering technique — you can trade resolution for speed. You&#39;ll also find a tweaked second-screen mechanism that makes for a more &quot;seamless&quot; integration with the primary display. The G14&#39;s Ryzen 6000-series CPUs, liquid metal-enhanced cooling and the IR camera have made their way to the Duo, although you&#39;ll be using NVIDIA graphics (up to the new RTX 3080 Ti).</p><p>&nbsp;Other laptops aren&#39;t quite as eye-catching, but might still scratch the itch for gamers on the move. The ROG Flow Z13 (at bottom) is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review-130044641.html">Surface Pro</a>-like 13.4-inch detachable for the gamer crowd with up to a 12th-gen Intel Core i9, a 4K screen and RTX 3050 Ti video, while the Strix G15 and G17 are more conventional 15- and 17-inch gaming portables that leap to the newest AMD processors and NVIDIA graphics. While pricing and availability are unknowns here as well, we&#39;d expect machines like the Duo and Flow to carry premiums given their still-rare form factors.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a9084320-68d0-11ec-bbaf-1473f59638ce" alt="ASUS ROG Flow Z13" data-uuid="62a00696-1213-3138-9385-bab6ab4d67d7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ASUS</div></figure><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-zephyrus-gaming-laptops-2022-200003687.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">85bf823b-a1a2-45ba-ac66-3347f35d4654</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 20:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641326642</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T20:04:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2d5f45e0-68c4-11ec-bffa-61076437bc29" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/2d5f45e0-68c4-11ec-bffa-61076437bc29" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ASUS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volvo says Qualcomm's car chipsets will make its infotainment system twice as fast]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/volvo/"><ins>Volvo</ins></a> will use Qualcomm&#39;s Snapdragon Cockpit Platforms to beef up the infotainment systems in some of its upcoming models.

The company has unveiled a Snapdragon Ride Vision platform that combines a 4-nanometer system-on-chip with Arriver&#39;s computer vision software to give automakers an &quot;open, scalable and modular&quot; way to build Level 2 driver assists and Level 3 partial autonomy into their cars.</p><p>Snapdragon Ride Vision can help cars detect road geometry, pedestrians and other cars using 8MP wide-angle cameras. It can also handle driver monitoring (to keep your hands or eyes focused on driving) and perception for near-field parking cameras. More importantly, the system is flexible — car designers can customize it to fit new vehicles and update features over the air.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The platform won&#39;t be ready for vehicle production until 2024.

The entire unfolding process took the better part of eight days, with a single day pause for the agency to optimize Webb’s power systems and tensioning motors. When you consider all the components involved, it’s easy to see why NASA says the process was so challenging.

The coronavirus pandemic then led to further delays in shipping and testing the telescope. There’s still more work to be done before scientists can use Webb to study black holes and other celestial bodies. Over the next five and a half months, NASA has to deploy the telescope’s secondary mirror as well as align its optics.

With the EAH-A800, Technics has built a pair of hi-fi-ready wireless headphones with active noise cancellation (ANC) and claims of a whopping 50 hours of use on a charge.&nbsp;</p><p>The over-ear EAH-A800 packs in 40mm drivers that Technics says are the result of its experience building hi-fi audio gear. In addition to a new design and materials for that component, an Acoustic Control Chamber manages air flow to assist with driver performance and bass response. The company has also leveraged capacitor tech from its high-end amplifiers to limit distortion and maintain sound quality. The EAH-A800 supports LDAC for higher quality audio over Bluetooth, in addition to the typical AAC standard.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/816c9a00-6d67-11ec-bffe-1223779fe6fc" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Technics EAH-A800" data-uuid="6c6e12d1-f826-3672-b228-9f7ae1d42f94"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Technics/Panasonic</div></figure><p>Technics promises &quot;industry-leading noise cancelling&quot; via a dual hybrid setup. An analog filter equipped feed back mic and a digital filter outfitted feed forward mic monitor unwanted clamor inside and out. The EAH-A800 also has Natural Ambient and Attention modes. The difference is that the latter makes it easier to hear voices while the former is a more universal transparency setting. Technics also provides multi-point pairing here, which will allow you to connect to two devices simultaneously over Bluetooth and easily switch between them.&nbsp;</p><p>The company is also making big promises when it comes to call clarity. Using a total of eight microphones, the EAH-A800 employs four to pick up your voice and four more to combat any environmental noise. Additionally, Technics says the feed forward mics are designed and positioned to reduce wind noise.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the most impressive claim on the EAH-A800 is the stated 50 hours of battery life. Technics says you can achieve this figure with ANC on listening to AAC audio. If you are listening via LDAC, the company says you can expect up to 40 hours of play time. Disable noise cancelling on either sound codec and listening time increases by 10 hours. So if you&#39;re willing to go without ANC or higher quality audio, you can get 60 hours of use out of these according to Technics. What&#39;s more, a 15-minute charge will give you 10 hours of use (ANC on, AAC quality streaming).&nbsp;</p><p>The EAH-A800 will be available in black and white color options in February for $350 (£299/€349).&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/technics-eah-a800-noise-cancelling-headphones-announced-price-specs-184515539.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">27f70860-85ba-4629-9fd5-2c4eb08042ca</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:45:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641311252</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T15:47:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e836b20-6d65-11ec-add9-7b4d379bef7b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9e836b20-6d65-11ec-add9-7b4d379bef7b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Technics/Panasonic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Technics EAH-A800]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Technics EAH-A800]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel's 12th-gen KS-series chips will reach 5.5GHz on a single core]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Intel is seriously planning to crank things up with its 12th-generation KS-series desktop CPUs.

The 16-inch model, at least, will be Acer’s first with Intel’s attempt at toppling NVIDIA’s leadership position in the mobile graphics space. That comes with a handful of other quality-of-life improvements, including a 400-nit (up from 300 nits last year), 100 percent sRGB, 16:10 display. You can choose either a WQXGA (2,560 x 1,600) or WUXGA (1,920 x 1,200) resolution screen to cram inside, too.</p><p>Build-to-order options include a new 12th-generation Intel Core processor paired with the new Arc graphics. That will be paired with up to 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM and up to 2TB SSD storage, as well as WiFi 6e. In person, it’s a little lighter than its immediate predecessor although if you were walking past it in a hurry you’d barely know the difference. The webcam is now FHD, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I wasn’t able to take any benchmarks on the pre-release hardware I was able to see in the flesh, but Acer is feeling bullish about the performance here. It says that its new dual fan design, bigger air vents (and they are beefy) and bigger inlets on the keyboard should expel up to 10 percent more heat than previous versions. You’ll also be able to switch to silent running should the need arise, albeit at the cost of much of your performance.</p><p>Acer also made it clear that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-x-geforce-rtx-30-series-thin-and-light-134500570.html">existing Swift X</a>, which is currently shipping with the option of an RTX 3050 / 3050 Ti, will remain on shelves for the foreseeable. That way, should you find Intel’s new silicon not to your taste, you can still get the upgrade you crave.</p><p>The 14-inch model, meanwhile, gets all of the other hardware bumps, including the better display options, the 12th generation Intel Chip, up to 16GB RAM and Windows 11. But graphics-wise, you’re left with the RTX 3050 / 3050 Ti, which is probably enough for most users who aren’t yet ready to jump feet-first into Intel’s new ocean.</p><p>We don’t have US pricing or availability for the Swifts just yet, but in the UK we’re expecting them to arrive by the end of February or the start of March for around £1,000 (around $1,350).</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-swift-x-16-intel-arc-graphics-181536080.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3b19e1e5-53db-47fd-9813-5500c2fa3319</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:15:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641322262</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:51:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1b577c10-6d8c-11ec-977d-7ca2030a8620" width="1874" height="1181" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1b577c10-6d8c-11ec-977d-7ca2030a8620" width="1874" height="1181" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Acer Swift X laptop on a wooden table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Swift X]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acer updates the Nitro 5 with AMD’s Ryzen 6000]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Often, the laptops that are announced at CES aren’t as exciting as the silicon that’ll be nestled inside them. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Acer&#x002019;s Nitro 5" href="https://fave.co/3sTvdtX">Acer’s Nitro 5</a> is one such example, where less attention will be paid to the more refined design, since everyone will be talking about its new brains. Like the fact that it’ll be able to use both AMD’s Ryzen 6000 and Intel’s 12th-generation Core processors. That will be paired with anything up to NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 3070 Ti, 32GB DDR4 3200 RAM and, depending on chip options, either a FHD 144Hz or QHD 165Hz panel.</p><p>Naturally, Acer has made a big effort to refine the chassis, despite it being a tiny bit thicker than its immediate predecessor. Rather than lots of chunky accents, the system goes for a more refined striped design, dialing down the more aggressive elements of its design. In addition, several ports are now sat on the back of the chassis since Acer knows that lots of people will use the Nitro 5 as a desktop replacement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sadly, I wasn’t able to do much beyond touch the new Nitro 5 and certainly there’s nothing too dramatic about the exterior changes. Acer was in no mood to allow me to run benchmarks, so all we can say for now is that we’re hopeful that it’ll do what AMD&#39;s other 6000 systems have been doing for a while.</p><p>In terms of when you can expect to be able to get your hands on one of these things, Acer says that the Intel edition will drop at some point in March, with the base model priced at $1,050. The AMD-toting version, meanwhile, will drop in April, with prices running from $1,099 up to whatever your budget and heart will allow.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-nitro-5-ryzen-6000-181528055.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">329b250d-e1b4-45c7-8861-39ed93520db5</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:15:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641322194</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:50:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25f99d70-6962-11ec-b2fd-050bd750d71a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25f99d70-6962-11ec-b2fd-050bd750d71a" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of Acer's Nitro 5 (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Nitro 5 (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acer's gaming laptops add 12th-gen Intel Core and NVIDIA RTX 30 Ti]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Acer" href="https://fave.co/3nhTZAr">Acer</a> is often quick to embrace the latest chips in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html">gaming laptops</a>, and that&#39;s particularly true this year.

Now in its third iteration (remember it was originally called Project Athena), the company says it&#39;s also adding a foldable specification for Evo PCs this year, along with new requirements around &quot;intelligent collaboration&quot; and support for faster H-series 12th-gen chips. So, in addition to guaranteeing long battery life and instant wake, new Evo PCs will also need to include WiFi 6E support, tap into the company&#39;s AI noise cancellation capabilities as well as Intel&#39;s Connectivity Performance Suite. The goal, as always, is to make sure consumers get the best experience possible when they&#39;re buying an &quot;Intel Evo&quot; branded PC.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1b62c7b0-6d81-11ec-bffb-77e9a79b2dc8" alt="Intel Evo 3rd gen specs" data-uuid="c0b5679e-2c23-3aa1-8b4b-33c99aa7a1e4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>Intel also offered more details around its <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/intel-to-acquire-israeli-company-screenovate-maker-of-screen-mirroring-tech/">plans for Screenovate</a>, a recent acquisition that gained notoriety for integrating iPhones and Android devices with Windows PCs. (It also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-09-dell-new-mobile-connect-software.html">powers Dell&#39;s Mobile Connect tool</a>, which allows you to send files to your phone and control its screen remotely.) According to Josh Newman, Intel&#39;s VP of Mobile Innovation, the company plans to bring Screenovate&#39;s technology to Evo PCs in the 2022 holiday season. The goal, naturally, is to offer it to more PCs eventually, but Newman says Intel wants to ensure that it&#39;s a high quality experience before that. The company plans to work with partners, including Apple, to make that happen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On stage during its CES presentation, Intel representatives showed Screenovate&#39;s software displaying iPhone text messages on a PC, as well as health data from an Apple Watch. They also demonstrated how an Android tablet could be converted into a secondary display. It didn&#39;t appear to be as seamless as Apple&#39;s SideCar feature, which lets iPads work as screens while connected to Macs, but it&#39;s a start.&nbsp;</p><p>While Intel&#39;s specialized Project Athena/Evo PC branding seemed more like a marketing stunt at first, it&#39;s actually pushing PC makers to build better hardware. Newman says that partners are building off of Intel&#39;s foldable PC design, while also adding their own twists. The specification also gives Intel a bit more leverage: for example, it&#39;s requiring partners to design keyboard accessories for their foldables. While Intel can&#39;t force them to include keyboards in the box, company representatives tells us they&#39;re being &quot;encouraged&quot; to do so.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-evo-3rd-edition-foldable-pc-iphone-181039141.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e97fe72a-ef7c-4f63-b26a-dc05370fcec9</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:10:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641320659</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:24:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/02145b20-6d81-11ec-bbfd-aa12ea9e5eaa" width="1280" height="853" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/02145b20-6d81-11ec-bbfd-aa12ea9e5eaa" width="1280" height="853" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman using an Intel Evo branded notebook.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel Evo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HP's latest Envy desktop PC comes with 12th-gen Intel chips and RTX 3080 Ti graphics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>HP has unveiled its latest <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Envy desktop PC" href="https://fave.co/3ESES6o">Envy desktop PC</a>.

To recap, the company&#39;s new CPUs (previously codenamed Alder lake) combine performance cores (P-cores) and efficient cores (E-cores) on a single chip. The idea is that they&#39;ll be able to better handle the demands of real-world computing, like juggling gaming on the faster cores while the slower ones power your livestream. In addition to faster performance, that tag-team approach could also lead to better battery for laptops.</p><p>Intel&#39;s 12th-gen laptop CPUs will top out at 14 cores, consisting of six P-cores and eight E-cores (that&#39;s two fewer P-cores than the desktop versions). At this point, Intel is mainly focusing on its powerful H-series 12th-gen chips, which are meant for 14-inch ultraportables, gaming notebooks and other beefy machines. The company also unveiled specs for its its U and P-series chips, which it&#39;ll discuss further in the first quarter. Those will be aimed at smaller ultraportables, as well as &quot;performance thin and light&quot; machines (like Dell&#39;s new XPS 13 Plus), respectively.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As for other new features, Intel&#39;s 12th-gen mobile hardware will also support DDR5-4800 and low-power LPDDR5-5200 RAM. Expect to pay a premium for DDR5-equipped machines, though, as PC makers predict stock will be limited throughout 2022. Wi-Fi 6E is also baked in, just in time to hop onto the new 6GHz bands from last year&#39;s 6E routers. And of course, Thunderbolt 4 is back to deliver 40Gbps of bandwidth goodness.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3e610d70-6d28-11ec-af7d-2a488be6b91c" style="height:1334;width:2000;" alt="Intel 12th-gen mobile CPUs" data-uuid="4b685455-5220-3339-bf76-11bebcff3d56"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p></p><p>While we haven&#39;t been able to test out Intel&#39;s 12th-gen desktop chips, early reviews have <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17047/the-intel-12th-gen-core-i912900k-review-hybrid-performance-brings-hybrid-complexity">praised their multitasking performance</a>, especially with the increased bandwidth from DDR5 RAM. We&#39;d expect a similar upgrade on the notebook front. For now, though, all we have to go on are Intel&#39;s numbers: the company claims 12th-gen is up to 40 percent faster than 11th-gen chips overall. The top-end Core-i9 12900HK is also up to 28 percent faster in gaming, and it has a commanding lead over the Ryzen 9 5900X across many titles.</p><p>In <em>Hitman 3</em>, a notoriously CPU-heavy game, the 12th-gen chips saw an 8 percent FPS bump through better workload prioritization. The P-cores handled rendering and more demanding tasks, while the E-core focused on background audio. As for productivity tasks, the 12900HK was 44 percent faster than 11th-gen hardware in the Premiere Pro PugetBench test, as well as 30 percent quicker when it came to Blender rendering. Intel&#39;s own benchmarks also showed Apple&#39;s M1 Pro and M1 Max, as well as the Ryzen 5900HX, trouncing the Core i9-11980HK in Blender. In many ways, the 12th-gen hardware feels like an apology for last year&#39;s chips.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3e613481-6d28-11ec-9fdd-cecdb19ada4d" style="height:778;width:1514;" alt="Intel 12th-gen mobile CPUs" data-uuid="882b052c-8bf3-35c4-8fdb-1d96f2ac9c92"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Intel</div></figure><p>More so than the fastest 12th-gen hardware, it&#39;d be interesting to see what sort of performance gains Intel can eke out from its more accessible Core i5 and i7 chips. The i5-12450H features 8 cores (4P and 4E) with a max Turbo speed of 4.4GHz, whereas last year&#39;s 11500H had six cores that maxed out at 4.6Hz on a single core. Both chips have 12 threads (only P-cores support Hyperthreading, so their thread number is doubled), but the 12th-gen chip should be able to use its power more wisely. That could be good news for mainstream PC buyers who can&#39;t quite justify a core i9 machine.</p><section data-eng-breakout="a43c1488c64843eb99465c9005b02d16" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3e604a20-6d28-11ec-9cf2-dc3460ae81c1" alt="Intel 12th-gen mobile CPUs" data-uuid="6f41d41c-5f17-302e-a750-8402b91e60d4"></section><p>Intel&#39;s new hybrid architecture also leads to some interesting configurations for its other mobile processors. The fastest U-series model, the Core i7-1265U, is equipped with 2 performance cores and 8 efficient cores. That technically makes it a 10-core chip, whereas the previous U-series hardware topped out at four cores. The P-series performance notebook chips, meanwhile, sport up to 6 P-cores and 8 E-cores in the i7-1280p. Each mobile CPU line also has up to 96 graphics EUs (execution units), just like the 11th-gen chips.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to new mobile CPUs, Intel also unveiled the rest of its 12th-gen desktop lineup. It starts with the Celeron G6900, which has just two performance cores, and tops out with the 16-core i9-12900. (Overclockers are better off with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-core-cpu-hybrid-alder-lake-160014440.html">unlocked 12900K that debuted in October</a>.) Surprisingly, Intel isn&#39;t including any efficient-cores in its mainstream i3 and i5 chips; they&#39;re all P-cores, so they&#39;re not actually hybrid CPUs at all. System builders can buy unlocked i5 CPUs with four E-cores, but I&#39;d wager that could make things confusing for shoppers. Why is the i5-12600 a six-core chip when the i5-12600K (thanks to the addition of four E-cores) has 10?</p><p>Intel is still lagging behind AMD and Apple when it comes to node size — the 12th-gen chips are a refined version of its 10nm process, while AMD has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-09-amd-3rd-gen-ryzen-7-nanometer-mid-2019.html">building 7nm chips since 2019 </a>and is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-zen-4-genoa-bergamo-cpu-191633260.html">eyeing 5nm this year</a> — but the company&#39;s hybrid design shows plenty of promise. Just like with its recent desktop chips, though, the real question is how Alder Lake will compete with what AMD and Apple have in store for 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-12th-gen-cpu-laptops-alder-lake-181007259.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">09e65cb8-fa67-4cff-95bf-623f19b5a0e4</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:10:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641278192</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T06:36:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3e633050-6d28-11ec-bf1f-7106298adf59" width="2000" height="1240" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3e633050-6d28-11ec-bf1f-7106298adf59" width="2000" height="1240" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel 12th-gen mobile CPUs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel 12th-gen mobile CPUs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dell's XPS 13 Plus is a beautiful ultraportable, but it has no headphone jack]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="092a35a77e734f9eb97be4b1f2521a5d"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvxsgl7X5dA" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>We&#39;ve practically run out of superlatives for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html">Dell&#39;s XPS 13</a>, the company&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:flagship ultraportable" href="https://bit.ly/3pPxN21">flagship ultraportable</a> that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-10-tech-borderless-screen-bezels.html">sparked the slim bezel trend </a>and has remained one of our favorite notebooks for years. So where does Dell go from here? Say hello to the XPS 13 Plus, a more powerful and ambitiously designed notebook with a lattice-less keyboard (read: no space between the keys) and a glass haptic touchpad that blends right into the palm rest. It&#39;s a laptop that looks so sleek, it practically begs to be touched. It&#39;s just a shame that in its frenzy to create a modern masterpiece, Dell also removed the headphone jack. <em>Sigh</em>.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="03bfa111-473f-430e-8b88-8ec9a447af83"/><p>But before we dive into the many problems with that, let&#39;s take a look at what&#39;s good: The XPS 13 Plus pushes Dell&#39;s design capabilities to new heights. There&#39;s a focus on clean lines and minimalism, as if Dell carved a computer directly out of a slab of polished metal. In addition to that attractive new keyboard (which also sports larger key caps), the XPS 13 Plus is also powered by Intel&#39;s 28-watt 12th-gen processors. That&#39;s a healthy jump from the standard XPS 13&#39;s 15-watt chips, and it means you can expect a lot more performance from its 2.73-pound frame.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s also a row of capacitive touch function buttons above the keyboard, which look as if they&#39;re embedded right into the computer&#39;s metal case. I&#39;m sure some may prefer sticking with physical function buttons, but losing the extra row of keys adds to the air of simplicity Dell is striving for.</p><section data-eng-breakout="c0f7728cc7a64cafbc57811b3344dee3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f29fba20-6d78-11ec-b7ff-861af9a94f18" alt="Dell XPS 13 Plus"></section><p>But of course, minimalism also means cutting out extraneous design elements, which in this case means the headphone jack and mini-SD card slot from the standard XPS 13. It&#39;s not too surprising to see Dell cleaning up its port situation, but losing the headphone jack seems particularly egregious for a machine that&#39;s meant to be a super-powered XPS 13.</p><p>When we pressed Dell representatives on the issue, they noted that plenty of smartphones are also losing the nifty 3.5mm jack. While that&#39;s true, phones are also a very different use case. It makes more sense to wireless buds or headphones on the go, but I&#39;d wager many people have a nice pair of wired headphones by their computers. Part of me also wonders if the Dell reps have ever tried to connect random Bluetooth headphones  Windows. It&#39;s not nearly as simple as it is on phones.</p><p>During our brief hands-on time with the XPS 13 Plus, I also noticed that its new haptic touchpad could lead to some usability issues. You can&#39;t actually feel where the touchpad begins and ends, which led to some missed clicks while I was browsing the web and poking around Windows. I also occasionally had trouble differentiating between left and right clicks, since it was hard to judge where the center of the touchpad was. I&#39;d wager you&#39;d get used to it over time, but that&#39;s not exactly user friendly. Dell may have been better off using a thin Apple-esque border around the touchpads, which still looks pretty sleek on MacBooks.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f2a05660-6d78-11ec-acdf-e6f6b6dbdd66" alt="Dell XPS 13 Plus" data-uuid="621f9330-b9a8-3134-9611-c8c62532b320"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Despite my reservations around some of Dell&#39;s design choices, the XPS 13 Plus still looks and feels like an upgrade from the standard XPS 13. (That laptop isn&#39;t going anywhere either, but Dell isn&#39;t announcing any updates for CES.) The large borderless keyboard is a touch-typist&#39;s dream, and the Infinity Edge display still looks fantastic. You&#39;ll also be able to choose between OLED and LCD screen options, as you&#39;d expect. Dell managed to squeeze four speakers into the XPS 13 Plus as well, a first for its 13-inch ultraportables.</p><p>Dell says it&#39;s targeting a $1,200 starting price for the XPS 13 Plus — a bit more than the XPS 13 — and that it&#39;s planning to ship the notebook this spring.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dells-xps-13-plus-ultraportable-no-headphone-jack-180043410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1890ab5a-1b66-44fd-8db8-2ee3028e320a</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2022 18:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641321480</ingested><modified>2022-01-04T18:38:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f2b36930-6d78-11ec-9bff-751fab2ef4f2" width="2000" height="1225" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f2b36930-6d78-11ec-9bff-751fab2ef4f2" width="2000" height="1225" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dell XPS 13 Plus]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dell XPS 13 Plus]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
