Dubbed <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/verified"><ins>Deck Verified</ins></a>, the system groups games into four categories: “Verified,” “Playable,” “Unsupported” and “Unkown.”</p><p>If you see a game with the first badge, it means it will work great out of the box. Of the playable category, Valve says you may need to do some tweaking. For example, in a title like <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, you might have to download a community controller configuration before you can use the Steam Deck’s thumbsticks and face buttons to play the game. Valve lists <em>Half-Life: Alyx </em>as an example of an experience that you won’t be able to play on Steam Deck, suggesting the unsupported category will be mostly occupied by VR titles. Lastly, an unknown tag means the company hasn’t had a chance to test that game for compatibility yet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d9479620-305a-11ec-b716-14107f830dc1" style="height:1359;width:2176;" alt="Deck Verified" data-uuid="335af147-8f73-3ec0-a3e9-f3569b800438"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure><p>To earn verified status, a game must meet four criteria. First, it should include full controller support, and the onscreen keyboard should appear when needed. Second, you shouldn’t see any compatibility warnings. The game should also support the Steam Deck’s native 1,280 by 800 resolution, and text should be easily readable. Lastly, if the title is playable through Proton, everything, including any anti-cheat software, should work through the compatibility layer.</p><p>To make things easy, you’ll see the badges appear both in your Steam library and the store. Moreover, each time you go to buy a game, you’ll see a full compatibility report that lists any issues to expect when playing it. Valve says it’s also working on a system that will allow you to see what compatibility category each game in your library falls under before Steam Deck is available in December.&nbsp;</p><p>If nothing else, the system should make it easier to decide if it makes sense to buy a Steam Deck. The last thing anyone wants is to spend $400 on a new gadget and not be able to play their favorite games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-verified-compatibility-system-223810108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3796e2fe-32a0-4147-930b-39fc511a2179</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 22:38:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634593925</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T21:52:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c3657980-305a-11ec-afff-77eb41597111" width="2174" height="1358" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c3657980-305a-11ec-afff-77eb41597111" width="2174" height="1358" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Valve]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Valve Deck Verified]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Valve Deck Verified]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[EPA announces plans to regulate cancer-causing 'forever chemicals']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Showing up in everything from <a href="https://news.nd.edu/news/use-of-pfas-in-cosmetics-widespread-new-study-finds/">cosmetics</a> and dental floss to product packaging and cleaning supplies. <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pfas/pfas-explained">polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances</a>, or PFAS, are ubiquitous to the modern world. They&#39;re also known as &quot;forever chemicals&quot; as they do not break down in nature. What&#39;s more, they&#39;ve been linked to a host of human diseases, from thyroid conditions to certain cancers, which is why, in 2016, the Obama administration enacted a unenforceable recommendation limiting the amount of PFAS in a given product should not exceed 70 parts per trillion. On Monday, the Biden administration announced that it will give Obama&#39;s recommendation some teeth.</p><div id="56736af276424c3ca383754724ba5642"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today, <a href="https://twitter.com/EPAMichaelRegan?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EPAMichaelRegan</a> announced EPA’s Strategic Roadmap to confront <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PFAS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PFAS</a>.

There are concrete steps that we are taking that move this issue forward in a very aggressive way.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The EPA unveiled its 3-year roadmap towards regulating the class of chemicals on Monday centers on a trio of approaches: &quot;increase investments in research, leverage authorities to take action now to restrict PFAS chemicals from being released into the environment, and accelerate the cleanup of PFAS contamination,&quot; according to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-administrator-regan-announces-comprehensive-national-strategy-confront-pfas">the EPA</a>. To that end, the administration plans to set enforceable drinking water limits under the Safe Drinking Water Act, designate PFAS as a hazardous substance under CERCLA (which would hold manufacturers financially liable for incinerating the chemical or releasing it into waterways), set timelines for establishing effluent guideline limitations under the Clean Water Act, review rules and guidance under the Toxic Substances Control Act, and expand monitoring, data collection and research of the chemicals. Additionally, the agency announced a new national testing strategy that will require PFAS manufacturers to provide toxicity data on the chemicals they create.&nbsp;</p><div id="adb030b67d7f4f68a87e235e5086936a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9W74aeuqsiU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>“Communities contaminated by these toxic forever chemicals have waited decades for action,” Ken Cook, President of the Environmental Working Group, said in a press statement. “So, it’s good news that Administrator Regan will fulfill President Biden’s pledge to take quick action to reduce PFOA and PFOS in tap water, to restrict industrial releases of PFAS into the air and water, and to designate PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances to hold polluters accountable. It’s been more than 20 years since EPA and EWG first learned that these toxic forever chemicals were building up in our blood and increasing our likelihood of cancer and other health harms. It’s time for action, not more plans, and that’s what this Administrator will deliver.&quot;</p><p>A handful of states including New Jersey, Vermont, Michigan, and New York, have already moved to regulate the chemicals on their own — California banned their use in baby and toddler products earlier this year — while the EU has banned many of the chemicals outright. The <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/can-epa-get-rid-toxic-forever-chemicals-n1281707">US Navy has announced</a> that it will ban PFAS from its firefighting foam by October, 2023, as directed by Congress.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/epa-announces-plans-to-regulate-cancer-causing-forever-chemicals-212350443.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b606c7d2-b599-4952-bf51-0073fc33848b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 21:23:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634590986</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T21:03:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/310da020-3056-11ec-b7bc-67f25cff4613" width="6360" height="4240" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/310da020-3056-11ec-b7bc-67f25cff4613" width="6360" height="4240" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drew Angerer via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 12: Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Michael Regan speaks during the daily press briefing at the White House on May 12, 2021 in Washington, DC.

After the by-the-numbers affair that was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-event-supercut-201538409.html"><ins>iPhone 13 event</ins></a>, Monday’s presentation was a more exciting thing to watch, thanks in large part to the first significant refresh to the MacBook Pro in five years. Here’s everything the company announced at the event.</p><h2>MacBook Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/97969f70-303a-11ec-9fff-50d91433effd" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Macbook Pro 2021 redesign" data-uuid="d993983f-b5e7-3916-b2d2-6bcd4d785116"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Unsurprisingly, the redesigned MacBook Pros were the star of the show, and there’s a lot to unpack between the two new 14- and 16-inch models. As expected, both laptops represent a return to form for the MacBook Pro line. Apple has replaced the Touch Bar with a standard set of function keys, as well as added MagSafe, an SD card slot and an HDMI port. New to both computers are 120Hz ProMotion displays. The 14-inch model will run its screen at 3,024 x 1,964, while the 16-inch variant has a 3,456 x 2,234 panel. Each also has an iPhone-style camera notch that is likely to be divisive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, you can configure both models with Apple’s new, more powerful M1 Pro and Max chips (more on them in a moment). All those new features come at a cost, with the 14-inch base model and 16-inch base model set to start at $1,999 and $2,499 respectively. You can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-apple-airpods-third-generation-macbook-pro-14-inch-16-inch-m1-pro-m1-max-182308261.html"><ins>pre-order</ins></a> both computers today, with general availability to follow on October 26th. In the meantime, macOS Monterey will land the day before on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-monterey-release-date-180751313.html"><ins>October 25th</ins></a>.</p><h2>M1 Pro and M1 Max</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d6db100-303e-11ec-abf7-2f2e15bed89c" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max chip" data-uuid="1328c132-0b4e-3f19-bec9-aaad1bf72bac"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><h2></h2><p>At the heart of the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros are Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. Both feature 5nm 10-core processors made up of eight high-performance cores and two high-efficiency units. Where they differ from one another is in terms of potential video and memory performance. The M1 Pro comes with up to 16 GPU cores and can support up to 32GB of RAM with 200 GB/s of bandwidth. The M1 Max, meanwhile, tops out at 32 graphics cores and double the RAM and memory bandwidth. In practice, Apple claims the chips are 70 percent faster than its previous M1 SoC and offer up to 1.7 times faster performance than competing CPUs from Intel and AMD. They should also make short work of the company’s updated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-m1-pro-max-update-183550958.html"><ins>Final Cut and Logic suites</ins></a>.</p><h2>AirPods</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a063b920-3036-11ec-b7d7-7c35df5aba66" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Airpods" data-uuid="fc33df11-85c2-36bb-bbff-777d0bd788eb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Going into Monday’s event, we were confident Apple would update its “basic” AirPods. But other than an AirPods Pro-like design, we weren’t expecting them to get many new features. So what we saw today was a surprise. While you won’t find ANC on the updated AirPods, they do include support for Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and Adaptive EQ. The latter allows the AirPods to adjust the low and mid-range frequencies of audio in real-time. Other notable specs include IPX4 sweat and water resistance and up to 30 hours total of battery life with help from the included charging case.</p><p>You can pre-order the new AirPods starting today for $179. They’ll begin shipping on October 26th. For those who want to save some money, Apple has discounted the second-generation AirPods to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-second-gen-discount-173918293.html"><ins>$129</ins></a>.</p><h2>Apple Music Voice Plan</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0df6fb60-3036-11ec-afd7-07a954a8ac88" style="height:1300;width:2000;" alt="Apple HomePod Mini" data-uuid="e9285fd7-982a-3b8c-a479-8500ca331028"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Alongside the third-generation AirPods, the company announced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-plan-171329499.html"><ins>discounted Apple Music</ins></a> plan. It will only set you back $5 per month but the catch is you can only control the service through Siri. Apple pitched the plan as the ideal complement for the HomePod mini.

It’ll apparently also feature a built-in accelerometer that’s designed to reduce external noise. As for battery life, the outlet reports that it’ll have 6 hours with ANC or Transparency Mode enabled or 7 hours with Adaptive EQ. The charging case will supposedly give it a total of around 27 to 30 hours of charge.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>9to5Mac</em> reports that Beats Fit Pro is scheduled to be announced the week of November 1st, with shipment occurring later.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-leak-191933131.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f848360b-96a6-491f-89d5-06676815a692</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 19:19:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634585300</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T19:28:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6871b130-3049-11ec-b99b-8bd3248124fa" width="1336" height="758" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6871b130-3049-11ec-b99b-8bd3248124fa" width="1336" height="758" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[9to5Mac]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro leaked images.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Disney delays all of Marvel’s 2022 films]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/disney/">Disney</a> has shaken up its movie release calendar, with several <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel%20cinematic%20universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> flicks being delayed. The revamped schedule, which <a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/disney-delays-doctor-strange-thor-black-panther-1235091673/"><em>Variety</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>reports is due to a production-related snowball effect, affects the slate for 2022 and beyond, and it will have a knock-on effect on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/disney%20plus">Disney+</a>.</p><p>All of the MCU films Disney had on the docket for 2022 have been pushed to a later slot. <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </em>was penciled in for March 25th, but now it&#39;s taking <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>&#39;s old date of May 6th. The next Thor movie will arrive on July 8th, in turn pushing back <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> to November 11th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The schedule shifts mean there will only be three Marvel movies next year instead of the planned four, as <em>Captain Marvel</em> sequel <em>The Marvels </em>now has a release date of February 17th, 2023. <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania </em>has moved from that date to July 28th, 2023. On the flip side, Disney brought one mystery Marvel movie (hopefully <em>Guardians of the Galaxy 3</em>) forward by a week from November 10th, 2023.</p><p>Elsewhere, the next Indiana Jones movie has been delayed by 11 months. You&#39;ll need to wait until June 30th, 2023 for Harrison Ford&#39;s fifth stint as the iconic archeologist. Ford sustained an injury while filming this summer, though he&#39;s now back in action. A live-action Disney movie, a 20th Century film and two Marvel flicks (all untitled) have been removed from the 2023 schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>Remarkably, given how many times the film has been delayed over the years, Disney hasn&#39;t shifted Avatar 2&#39;s release date. It&#39;s still on the schedule for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-avatar-delay-220932930.html">December 16th, 2022</a>.</p><p>It remains to be seen what impact these changes will have on Disney+. For the rest of 2021, Disney has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-remaining-2021-movies-theaters-first-161307055.html">committed to an exclusive theatrical window</a> for its films before they&#39;re available to stream, but it hasn&#39;t divulged how things will work in 2022 and beyond.</p><p>The company adopted a simultaneous release strategy for some of its movies over the last year or so amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-mulan-release-182440824.html"><em>Mulan</em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/raya-and-the-last-dragon-disney-plus-220319407.html"><em>Raya and the Last Dragon</em></a><em>, Cruella </em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-disney-plus-release-date-premier-access-184407477.html"><em>Black Widow</em></a> requiring a $30 Premier Access pass for early access on Disney+. Disney&#39;s decision to let viewers stream <em>Black Widow </em>at home on the same day it hit theaters <a href="https://www.engadget.com/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-sues-disney-streaming-marvel-cinematic-universe-183341118.html">prompted</a> a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-settles-scarlett-johansson-lawsuit-black-widow-024836370.html">now-settled lawsuit</a> from star Scarlett Johansson.

The company has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/final-cut-pro-and-logic-pro-updated-on-the-new-macbook-pro-with-m1-pro-m1-max/">released</a> new versions of Final Cut Pro (10.6) and Logic Pro (10.7) that make the most of the M1 Pro and M1 Max, particularly in video processing and machine learning. FCP editors can play up to seven streams of 8K ProRes at once, and export in the format over five times faster — no mean feat for a laptop, as Apple was keen to point out. You can even color-grade 8K HDR footage using only the MacBook Pro&#39;s built-in screen.</p><p>There&#39;s also a new Object Tracker you can use to link animated effects to faces and objects. You can easily edit Cinematic Mode video from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone 13 series</a>, too. Motion now renders visual effects work up to two times faster, and can play two 8K video streams at five times the previous frame rate. Compressor, meanwhile, transcodes HEVC video up to twice as fast, and ProRes up to ten times as quickly. And if you live in Canon&#39;s world, you can transcode Cinema RAW Light videos to other formats for the first time. There&#39;s even a Watch Folders feature that will automatically encode content when it reaches a given folder — helpful for streamlining a workflow, particularly among teams.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Logic Pro update, meanwhile, is focused on spatial audio creation — just in time for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-gen-announced-price-specs-availability-171540519.html">new AirPods</a>, of course. New mixers, panners and plugins let you author Dolby Atmos tracks, and the new MacBook Pros can use their added performance to create particularly advanced mixes. The music editing tool now comes bundled with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/garageband-dua-lipa-lady-gaga-remix-mark-ronson-172019456.html">Producer Packs</a> you saw in GarageBand, too, so you can integrate royalty-free beats and samples from the likes of Boys Noize, Mark Ronson and Trakgirl.</p><p>Both updates are free for existing users. Final Cut Pro normally costs $300 for new users, with Motion and Compressor costing $50 each. Logic Pro is priced at $200. The upgrades make the most sense if you&#39;re deeply invested in ProRes or intend to publish on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-plan-171329499.html">Apple Music</a>. Still, it&#39;s easy to see the appeal, at least for FCP. You could quickly turn around certain video projects using only your MacBook Pro, even if you&#39;re working primarily with 8K footage.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-m1-pro-max-update-183550958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cee5f04d-d7a0-4b32-b2eb-ba67b0b71615</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 18:35:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634582153</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T18:35:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe2eeff0-303d-11ec-9ab7-c35e7aaad8af" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe2eeff0-303d-11ec-9ab7-c35e7aaad8af" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro optimized for MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro optimized for MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to pre-order Apple’s new AirPods and MacBook Pros]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-what-to-expect-october-18-unleashed-142518973.html">&quot;Unleashed&quot; event</a> today focused on music and the Mac, with the company revealing updated products in each category. We finally got word of the next-generation AirPods, which have a new design and support for spatial audio plus MagSage wireless charging. The company also unveiled new colors for its HomePod mini smart speaker and two new MacBook Pros for the power users among us. The laptops run on the company&#39;s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chipsets and sport revamped designs with webcam notches, Liquid Retina XDR displays and extra ports (HDMI and an SD slot!).

Inside the buds is a new low-distortion driver that produces powerful bass along with crisp highs. These buds have a few features previously only available on AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, including spatial audio and Adaptive EQ, the latter of which automatically adjusts frequencies in real time based on what you&#39;re listening to.</p><p>The new AirPods have a sweat and water-resistant design and Apple improved the battery life, too. These should last up to six hours on a  charge, and you&#39;ll get an hour of listening time after only five minutes of charging. The case is now MagSafe and wireless-charging capable and it holds four additional full charges, so you can enjoy around 30 hours of total listening time.</p><p>Apple is keeping the second-generation AirPods around, which will be good for anyone who doesn&#39;t want to shell out $179 for the new ones. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-second-gen-discount-173918293.html">second-generation AirPods</a> are now priced at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$129" href="https://amzn.to/3n8Ts2L">$129</a>, and the AirPods Pro are still listed $250 (although you can often find them for less) and they now come with a MagSafe charging case.</p><h2>MacBook Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2051cc60-303e-11ec-bbd3-820c64513272" alt="Apple MacBook Pro 2021" data-uuid="8a3d92c7-2807-334e-a2d1-4a78385a50e3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Apple&#39;s latest <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch">14-</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">16-inch MacBook Pros</a> come equipped with the company&#39;s new M1 Pro or M1 Max processors, and feature a brand new design with a webcam notch and some much-requested extra ports.

The laptop ushers in several significant design changes, including a new keyboard that&#39;s supposed to be more similar to the company&#39;s Magic Keyboard for iMac. Also, the TouchBar is gone; it&#39;s been replaced with physical Function keys, something that TouchBar skeptics will likely cheer.</p><p>These MacBook Pros are thicker than previous models because they actually have a healthy variety of ports. Both have a total of three Thunderbolt 4 ports along with an HDMI socket, an SD card slot, a headphone jack and a MagSafe connector for charging (although you can power up via the Thunderbolt ports as well). This will be a welcome change for power users who have been living the dongle life for years with previous-gen MacBook Pros.</p><p>Additionally, the new laptops have Liquid Retina XDR displays that reach almost to the end of the machines&#39; lids, interrupted by a notch that holds the 1080p webcam. The 14-inch model has a 14.2-inch 3,024 x 1,964 resolution screen, to be precise, while the 16-inch model has a 16.2-inch 3,456 x 2,234 panel. Both support ProMotion with refresh rates up to 120Hz. Apple is promising up to 17 hours of video playback on the 14-inch model and up to 21 hours of video playback on the larger version. As for other specs, you can customize the laptops with up to 32GB of RAM and up to a whopping 8TB of storage.</p><h2>HomePod mini</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4406ba80-303e-11ec-96fd-8d8cd58ac9eb" alt="Apple HomePod mini" data-uuid="310f5d01-95fe-31cd-8749-72ce460754c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Lastly, Apple announced new colors of the HomePod mini: yellow, orange and blue.

The feature, which builds one earlier Continuity updates, allows users to drag and drop files between multiple devices and type on an iPad from a MacBook keyboard.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But both SharePlay and Universal Control, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macos-monterey-public-beta-launch-171820026.html">wasn’t available</a> in initial betas of macOS Monterey, will be arriving after the initial update &quot;later this fall,&quot; according to Apple.</p><p>The release also comes with a major update <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fix-safari-tab-bar-design-third-ios-15-mac-os-monterey-beta-180648751.html">to Safari</a> that’s at times been controversial due to significant changes to the tab bar and other key features. (The most recent beta brought back the tab bar by default after earlier versions of the update removed it.) Other <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/">improvements</a> to look forward to include Live Text, a Google Lens-like feature that allows you to select text within photos, and the addition of Quick Notes. MacOS is also getting some updates that first appeared in iOS 15, including Focus Modes, and support for &quot;Shared with You,&quot; which keeps track of content shared within the Messages app.</p><p>Apple is bringing two other important iOS features to the Mac with the Shortcuts app and support for AirPlay, as Macs running macOS Monterey will be able to use their devices as an AirPlay speaker.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/macos-monterey-release-date-180751313.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">73dc7391-ddf4-4499-8556-e1967a69c2ae</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 18:07:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634582940</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T18:49:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1f1c7620-303d-11ec-bffe-d72b128e085b" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1f1c7620-303d-11ec-bffe-d72b128e085b" width="2400" height="1600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[macOs Monterey is optimized for the new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[macOS monterey]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple cuts the price of the second-gen AirPods to $129]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple revealed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-gen-announced-price-specs-availability-171540519.html">an all-new set of AirPods</a> today, but the current model isn&#39;t going away just yet.

But, as expected, Apple is giving the MacBook Pro a complete do-over, and it sounds an improvement in several areas.</p><p>The laptops come in 14.2- and 16.2-inch models, with increased resolutions over the earlier models. The <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch">14-inch model</a> runs at 3,024 x 1,964 resolution, while the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">16-inch models</a> has 3,456 x 2,234 resolution. ProMotion high refresh rate is on board, too, with up to a 120Hz option. But, the laptops also have a camera notch, just like the iPhone, something that was rumored in the lead-up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-what-to-expect-october-18-unleashed-142518973.html">today&#39;s &quot;Unleashed&quot; press event</a>. The notch is about the size of the menu bar, so while it&#39;s a bit strange it still offers way more screen real estate than before. And, both laptops are using mini LED technology, similar to what’s in the current 12.9-inch iPad Pro.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Naturally, Apple’s latest laptops are using the company’s own custom silicon. This time, it’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-chips-macbook-pro-172415918.html">the M1 Pro</a>. As the rumors predicted, it’s a 5-nanometer, 10-core chip with eight high-performance cores and two efficiency cores. It&#39;s 70 percent faster than the M1, and has one 16 graphics cores. Apple also announced an M1 Max, which has twice the memory bandwidth as the M1 Pro (400GB/s), and it also has 32 graphics cores. The M1 Max also supports up to 64GB memory, a huge improvement over the 16GB of memory that was supported by the M1.</p><p>As for ports, those of us out there who miss the plentiful options on older MacBooks should be pretty happy here. The new MacBook Pro unsurprisingly features three USB-C / Thunderbolt ports, but it also brings back an HDMI socket and SD card slot, two features fans have long been demanding be re-added. There aren’t any USB-A ports here, but the SD card slot and HDMI port should definitely reduce people&#39;s reliance on dongles.</p><p>Another old friend from MacBooks past has made a return here. Apple has implemented a new version of its MagSafe connector, which it used on its laptops for years prior to 2016. It’s different from the old connector, so you won’t be able to bust out a charger from years past and expect it to work, unfortunately. That said, you can still charge via USB-C if that&#39;s your jam.</p><p>The camera system has been improved here as well, with computational video and a 1080p resolution with an f/2.0 four-element lens. And the 16-inch laptop has a six-speaker system, with tweeters nearly two times larger than before. The keyboard, meanwhile, keeps the redesigned scissor switch mechanism, but the Touch Bar is gone, replaced with a standard function key row.</p><p>Battery life for these laptops should be pretty excellent. Apple says that the 14-inch model will run for 17 hours while playing video, while the 16-inch can last up to 21 hours. And they have fast charging, so you can get 50 percent of your battery life refilled in about 30 minutes.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, these laptops are also expensive. The 14-inch model starts at $1,999, while the 16-inch version starts at $2,499. Apple is also keeping the old-design 13-inch MacBook Pro with an M1 chip around for those who can&#39;t justify spending two grand or more on their next laptop.&nbsp;</p><p>The entry-level <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch">$1,999 14-inch configuration</a> comes with the M1 Pro with eight CPU cores, 14 graphics cores, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage. That&#39;s less performance than Apple promised out of the M1 Pro; to get the full 10-core CPU and 16-core graphics, you&#39;ll need to spend $2,499. That price bump also gets you 1TB of storage.&nbsp;</p><p>The base <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> (<a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch">$2,499</a>) has almost the same specs as the $2,499 14-inch model: an M1 Pro with 10 CPU cores, 16 graphics cores, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of memory. Spending an extra $200 doubles the storage, bringing it to 1TB. If you want the M1 Max, you&#39;re looking to spend $3,499, with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. You can pre-order now, and they&#39;ll be available on October 26th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e32631a4-6de3-4ff3-a0ca-5626e8b01bde</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:34:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634582722</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T18:45:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/97969f70-303a-11ec-9fff-50d91433effd" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/97969f70-303a-11ec-9fff-50d91433effd" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Macbook Pro 2021 redesign]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Macbook Pro 2021 redesign]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[M1 Pro and M1 Max are Apple's high-end Mac chips]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s been almost a year since Apple unveiled its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-m1-mac-181040846.html">first custom chip for Macs, the ARM-based M1</a>. As we saw in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">our review of the latest MacBook Air</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">MacBook Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html">colorful iMac</a>, the M1 was a marvel, proving to be both faster than Intel and AMD&#39;s x86 processors, while also drawing far less power. Now, in a follow-up move, Apple is taking a two-pronged approach with M1 Pro and M1 Max, the two chips underpinning the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html">new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d4224e90-3039-11ec-bde5-989a9e1afa90" alt="Apple M1 Pro" data-uuid="f2cf2536-35b2-38fb-863e-7b243c10a829"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Both chips have 5nm 10-core processors, comprised of eight high-performance cores and two high-efficiency units. What separates them are their GPU and memory capabilities: the M1 Pro has up to a 16-core GPU while the Max has tops out at 32 graphics cores. In comparison, last year&#39;s M1 was an eight-core chip that maxed out with eight GPU cores. The M1 Pro comes with up to 32GB of RAM with 200 GB/s of bandwidth, while the M1 Max doubles both of those figures, supporting up to 64GB of RAM.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d420c7f0-3039-11ec-af5f-77c94976dcc0" alt="Apple M1 Max" data-uuid="d5e152d1-8a8f-3e6a-a92c-5783a1d75f82"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Based on these specs, power users will see a much bigger performance upgrade by going for a MacBook Pro. Last year&#39;s M1-equipped 13-inch MacBook Pro wasn&#39;t much faster than the M1 Air; the Pro basically added a fan for more sustained workloads, whereas the Air was miraculously fanless. That was an odd situation for Apple: It was both a testament to the power of Apple silicon, and a sign that the company needed to devote more time to its powerful machines.</p><p>Given that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-macbook-pro-16-inch-review-ultimate-apple-laptop.html">16-inch MacBook Pro </a>was practically forgotten over the past year, the M1 Pro and M1 Max are exactly what creative professionals have been waiting for. And that&#39;s before you get to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html">all of the other updates coming to the new notebooks</a> (More ports! An SD card slot!). Apple says the chips offer up to 1.7X faster performance than competing eight-core PC chips, which makes them particularly compelling for people doing heavy-duty 3D and video rendering.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-chips-macbook-pro-172415918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a71ad9d6-435c-4a71-aaa2-c0111e6f4279</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:24:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634580657</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T18:11:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d6db100-303e-11ec-abf7-2f2e15bed89c" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9d6db100-303e-11ec-abf7-2f2e15bed89c" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max chip]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple M1 Pro and M1 Max chip]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's redesigned AirPods bring Spatial Audio and Adaptive EQ for $179]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s no denying the popularity of <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/">Apple&#39;s AirPods</a>, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-03-apple-airpods-review-2019-more-of-the-same.html">the regular model</a> has been overdue for a refresh. Announced in spring 2019, the second generation of the company&#39;s true wireless earbuds brought improvements like faster pairing, hands-free Siri and wireless charging. While <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">some companies</a> are cranking out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">multiple models a year,</a> Apple hasn&#39;t needed to do that, hence the two-year gap <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">between new models</a>. Today, the company finally debuted the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/introducing-the-next-generation-of-airpods/">third-iteration AirPods</a> with an updated design, Spatial Audio, Adaptive EQ and one-touch setup.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple says the newest AirPods are safe for workouts thanks to IPX4 sweat and water resistance. Hands-free Siri is back, while a skin sensor detects when you&#39;re wearing the earbuds, automatically pausing when one is removed. As for battery life, you can expect up to six hours of listening and 30 hours of total usage with the charging case. Speaking of the case, it supports MagSafe charging. Additionally, a new one-touch setup quickly pairs the buds with Apple products.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="56e4d834-a3ca-4a18-beb0-72a20d4c5b6a"/><p>With the third-gen AirPods, Apple is bringing Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking to its regular model. Head tracking also works with Group FaceTime calls so that voices sound like they&#39;re coming from the direction they&#39;re positioned on screen. Apple says this makes for a more immersive setup, so it sounds more like you&#39;re in the same room with other attendees. The company claims that support for the AAC-ELD codec enables improved speech quality and says its microphones are covered with &quot;acoustic mesh&quot; to help reduce wind noise.</p><p>Apple also equipped its new AirPods with Adaptive EQ. This technology tunes the audio in real time according to inward-facing mics that monitor sound. Computational audio adjusts low and mid-range frequencies as any variances occur. This works like Adaptive EQ on AirPods Pro and AirPods Max, so Apple is extending much of the tech-heavy features from its pricier models to the base AirPods.&nbsp;</p><p>The third-generation AirPods are up for <a href="https://www.apple.com/airpods/">pre-order today for $179</a> and will begin shipping on October 26th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-gen-announced-price-specs-availability-171540519.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4236020e-d35d-4871-8722-ac2d74889129</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:15:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634580696</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T18:11:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a063b920-3036-11ec-b7d7-7c35df5aba66" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a063b920-3036-11ec-b7d7-7c35df5aba66" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Airpods]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Airpods]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple’s HomePod mini lineup adds three new colors]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple will soon offer the HomePod mini in <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-introduces-homepod-mini-in-new-bold-and-expressive-colors/">three new colors</a>.

The company has introduced an Apple Music Voice Plan that offers access to the full song catalog for just $5 per month, so long as you&#39;re willing to rely solely on Siri control. It&#39;s pitched as ideal for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-review-140030652.html">HomePod</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-gen-announced-price-specs-availability-171540519.html">AirPod</a> owners and others who are more likely to use a voice assistant than tap their phone.</p><p>The new tier will be available later in the fall in 17 countries, including the US, UK and Canada. You can start a trial by asking Siri to &quot;start my Apple Music Voice trial.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Discounted tiers certainly aren&#39;t new to music streaming. However, they tend to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-student-discounts-140038070.html">student plans</a> available to a relatively small slice of the population. Apple is clearly betting that the Music Voice Plan will not only reach a wider audience, but strike an appealing balance between ad-supported free offerings like Spotify and the $10-plus you&#39;d pay per month for conventional services.</p><p>There are catches, of course. Siri control means investing in the Apple ecosystem — you&#39;ll have to pay the regular rate if you use platforms like Android. And this only really works if your favorite music is easy to play using voice control. The Voice Plan won&#39;t be ideal if you like classical or certain forms of electronic music, for example. If you tend to stick to popular genres or rely more on playlists, though, you might not mind the compromise.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Apple’s Mac event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/mac%20event%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-voice-plan-171329499.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">70cc71c2-dbc9-4743-afe8-f94607de5da9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 17:13:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634583147</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T18:52:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7a68c3e0-303c-11ec-9756-7ff4ae11e28d" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7a68c3e0-303c-11ec-9756-7ff4ae11e28d" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple HomePod 2021]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple HomePod 2021]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reddit’s first live show is a Photoshop competition]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/reddit/">Reddit</a> has teamed up with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/adobe/">Adobe</a> as part of its push into original content. <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/reddit-originals-photoshopbattles-live-bunim-murray-productions-1234857587/">Its first live show</a> is an comedy competition series called <em>PsBattles Live, </em>which<em>&nbsp;</em>will stream on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/psbattleslive/">r/PsBattlesLive</a> subreddit every day this week.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Shrill</em> star Patti Harrison hosts <em>PsBattles Live</em>, which will stream at 3PM ET every day.

It&#39;s arguably the best and most practical version of a Samsung foldable yet, and now it&#39;s been discounted by $150 on Amazon as part of the deals-focused event dubbed Samsung Week. That brings the final price down to $850, which is a record low.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3vuUUjO" id="0c6b626e6f0543c39061222045125e5b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Z Flip 3 at Amazon - $850</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2YX01NT" id="a36805dddf5f45a0b93ccfe892627043" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Shop Samsung Week deals</a><p>We gave the Z Flip 3 a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review-price-specs-cameras-screen-170051882.html">score of 82</a> in part because Samsung fixed a few things about its predecessor with this smartphone. First off, it seems to be more durable than the last — it doesn&#39;t scratch as easily and now is IPX8 water resistant. The main 6.7-inch AMOLED display runs at a 2,640 x 1,080 resolution and supports 120Hz refresh rates. Yes, you will notice its crease, but it doesn&#39;t hinder readability — you&#39;ll notice is more so because you&#39;re probably not used to a screen that folds in this way. When closed, you can use the 1.9-inch external screen to get small bits of information like the weather and calendar events, as well as quickly access features like Samsung Pay and media controls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new Flex Mode kicks in when you half-fold the device, and it&#39;ll split the screen in half when in certain apps. When watching a YouTube video, for example, the video player will be on the top half of the screen while the video&#39;s details and comments section will be on the bottom. It&#39;s a clever way to ensure that the entirety of the main screen is useful even when the device is partially folded, although we&#39;d like to see a greater variety of apps support Flex Mode sooner rather than later.</p><p>The Z Flip 3 runs on a Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM, and it has a dual camera setup on the back along with a 10-megapixel selfie camera. The two 12MP rear cameras took colorful, detailed shots, and even nighttime photos looks very similar to those taken by competing phones from Apple and Google.</p><p>The biggest sacrifices you&#39;ll have to make with the Z Flip 3 are in durability and battery life. The former is a bit of a toss up — we only used the Z Flip 3 for a short period of time when we reviewed it, so it&#39;s unclear how well its foldable screen will hold up after months and years of use. As for battery life, it will depend on how much you use the external display. The Z Flip 3 lasted more than a day in our testing, but that figure dropped to around 11.5 hours when the external display was in always-on mode. If those sound like acceptable trade-offs to you, Amazon&#39;s sale on the Z Flip 3 is the best way we&#39;ve seen so far to get the foldable at a more affordable price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-drops-to-850-at-amazon-samsung-week-deals-143712131.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">15cb0fb7-c072-4cc2-b4bd-550dea88a652</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 14:37:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634567835</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T14:37:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c99b2be0-00f5-11ec-b6ff-6e47595e29c3" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c99b2be0-00f5-11ec-b6ff-6e47595e29c3" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 half folded and set up on a table.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon accused of lying about its business practices to Congress]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Members of Congress have accused <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon/">Amazon</a> executives of misleading or lying to an antitrust committee about its business practices, following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-india-products-copy-search-results-manipulation-174030250.html">recent reports</a> that the company uses third-party seller data to copy products and promotes those versions in search results.

David Cicilline, Ken Buck, Pramila Jayapal, Jerrold Nadler and Matt Gaetz asked Amazon to provide &quot;exculpatory evidence” to back up testimony from executives )(including former CEO Jeff Bezos) to the subcommittee in 2019 and 2020, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/members-of-congressional-committee-question-if-amazon-executives-misled-congress-11634551201"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a><em>.</em> Bezos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-antitrust-hearing-third-party-sellers-201126053.html">told the committee last year</a> that the company doesn&#39;t allow employees to use data from individual sellers to bolster its own product lines, though &quot;couldn&#39;t guarantee&quot; that the company hasn&#39;t misused such data.

The representatives said the reporting directly contradicts sworn testimony from Bezos, from whom <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-amazon-ceo-final-date-174948346.html">Jassy took over in July,</a> and other executives.</p><p>“We strongly encourage you to make use of this opportunity to correct the record and provide the Committee with sworn, truthful, and accurate responses to this request as we consider whether a referral of this matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation is appropriate,” the lawmakers wrote in the letter. &quot;At best, this reporting confirms that Amazon&#39;s representatives misled the Committee. At worst, it demonstrates that they may have lied to Congress in possible violation of federal criminal law.&quot;</p><p>The House Judiciary Committee has been looking into this issue <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-13-us-asks-apple-google-facebook-and-amazon-for-docs-in-antitrust.html">since 2019</a> as part of a broader investigation of competition in digital markets. The representatives gave Jassy until November 1st to respond to the letter. &quot;We’re giving Amazon one last chance to come clean about how they abuse other seller’s data and unfairly advantage their own products,&quot; subcommittee chair Cicilline <a href="https://twitter.com/davidcicilline/status/1450097641472368648">wrote on Twitter</a>. &quot;We cannot continue to allow Big Tech to destroy small businesses.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Like other retailers, we look at sales and store data to provide our customers with the best possible experience,&quot; Amazon told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. &quot;However, we strictly prohibit our employees from using non-public, seller-specific data to determine which private label products to launch. While we don’t believe these claims are accurate, we take these allegations very seriously and have launched an internal investigation.&quot;</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson provided the following statement to Engadget:</p><blockquote><p>Amazon and its executives did not mislead the committee, and we have denied and sought to correct the record on the inaccurate media articles in question. As we have previously stated, we have an internal policy, which goes beyond that of any other retailer’s policy that we’re aware of, that prohibits the use of individual seller data to develop Amazon private label products. We investigate any allegations that this policy may have been violated and take appropriate action. In addition, we design our search experience to feature the items customers will want to purchase, regardless of whether they are offered by Amazon or one of our selling partners.</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-antitrust-seller-data-house-judiciary-committee-142110829.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4a95aab2-2dc7-4e17-9f2a-f957357306a1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 14:21:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634567042</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T14:24:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/4c92d490-bd70-11eb-91ff-aa70026e20e7" width="4200" height="2800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/4c92d490-bd70-11eb-91ff-aa70026e20e7" width="4200" height="2800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Ryder via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEATTLE, WA - MAY 20: A sign is seen outside of an Amazon Go store at the Amazon.com Inc. headquarters on May 20, 2021 in Seattle, Washington.

Sony&#39;s X950H LED 4K smart TVs are also<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid: up to 25 percent off" href="https://amzn.to/3jc38bF"> up to 25 percent off</a>, so you can get one for as low as $950.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ARN58O" id="cd67c65441454a278c8658d76fa2061d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 65-inch Sony A9G OLED at Amazon - $1,700</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3jcLXXq" id="1a17503394544e41b341eef9a45ce597" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 55-inch Sony X950H LED at Amazon - $950</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3C77gRL" id="c27c4a6162134e7d8595c61e5ff7fb03" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 65-inch Sony X950H LED at Amazon - $1,200</a><p>While the Bravia set is from 2019, it remains a solid OLED TV with a lot of high-end perks. First and foremost, you&#39;re getting all of the benefits of OLED, which means better colors, great contrast and deep blacks. It plays 4K HDR content, supports Dolby Vision and it includes the company&#39;s Acoustic Surface Audio+ speaker built-in, giving you more immersive sound quality. The set runs on Android TV, which means you can call upon the Google Assistant to play content and otherwise control the system — but it also supports Alexa voice commands too, if you prefer to use that. On top of all that, it has a dedicated Game Mode for smoother gaming sessions and it supports AirPlay 2 and HomeKit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those not set on OLED for their next TV should consider the 2020 Sony X950H sets on sale — the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:55-inch model" href="https://amzn.to/3jcLXXq">55-inch model</a> is down to $950 while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:65-inch set" href="https://amzn.to/3C77gRL">65-inch set</a> is on sale for $1,200. While the picture quality won&#39;t be the same as the OLED set, these TVs do have local dimming LED backlighting as well as many of the advanced features present in the A9G. You&#39;ll get the Android TV operating system, Google Assistant and Alexa support, Game Mode, plus AirPlay 2 and HomeKit compatibility.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-oled-led-smart-tvs-daily-deal-amazon-132918061.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">460a53d0-088c-418a-90ef-83a34d48fee1</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 13:29:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634563761</ingested><modified>2021-10-18T13:29:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8360ebd0-d06a-11eb-9faf-a3228bef42d1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/8360ebd0-d06a-11eb-9faf-a3228bef42d1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[65-inch Sony XBR-65A9G Master Series Bravia 4K OLED TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[65-inch Sony XBR-65A9G Master Series Bravia 4K OLED TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku's Streambar returns to record low of $100 ahead of the holidays]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As November inches closer, we&#39;re starting to see even more early Black Friday deals on gadgets crop up across the web.
