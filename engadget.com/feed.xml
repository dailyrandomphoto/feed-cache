Rolls-Royce is also <a href="https://www.rolls-royce.com/media/press-releases/2021/11-03-2021-rr-and-tecnam-join-forces.aspx">developing</a> an air taxi with manufacturer Tecnam, with the aim of delivering an &quot;all-electric passenger aircraft for the commuter market,&quot; according to the companies. It has previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-28-airbus-e-fan-x-hybrid-electric-aircraft.html">teamed with</a> Siemens and Airbus on another e-plane concept.&nbsp;</p><p>Aircraft companies have been exploring electric airplanes for a number of years, as air travel and cargo accounts for an increasing amount of greenhouse gases. The World Wildlife Foundation has <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/cutting-aviation-pollution#:~:text=Air%20travel%20is%20also%20currently,activity%20an%20individual%20can%20make.">called it</a> &quot;currently the most carbon intensive activity an individual can make.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Weight is a much bigger problem for airplanes that it is for cars, however. Ford&#39;s all-electric Lightning pickup weighs 1,800 pounds more than the gas-powered model, and offers a range that&#39;s slightly under half. However, if you added 1,800 pounds to to a <a href="https://cessna.txtav.com/en/piston/cessna-turbo-stationair-hd">Cessna 206 Turbo Stationair</a>, you&#39;d exceed its useful load by 500 pounds before you even loaded passengers (or the pilot) — so it wouldn&#39;t even get off the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>The project was half funded by the Aerospace Technology Institute and UK government, with the aim of eventually creating all-electric passenger planes. &quot;This is not only about breaking a world record; the advanced&nbsp;battery and propulsion technology developed for this programme has exciting applications for the Urban Air Mobility market and can help make ‘jet zero’ a reality,&quot; said Rolls-Royce CEO Warren East.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rolls-royces-all-electric-aircraft-completes-15-minute-maiden-voyage-143051424.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f656352-cf77-45b0-a669-42d0d0ed60bb</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 14:30:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631887503</ingested><modified>2021-09-17T14:05:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Airline Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/821d4e30-17b9-11ec-b3f9-f0dd9fabce24" width="2181" height="1282" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/821d4e30-17b9-11ec-b3f9-f0dd9fabce24" width="2181" height="1282" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rolls-Royce]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rolls-Royce's all-electric aircraft completes 15-minute maiden voyage]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rolls-Royce's all-electric aircraft completes 15-minute maiden voyage]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's new iPad mini is already discounted by up to $50]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-the-new-apple-ipad-and-ipad-mini-2021-184818462.html"><ins>Pre-orders have only just opened</ins></a> for Apple&#39;s latest lineup of products, but you can already find some discounts on the hardware.

channels to its smart TV platform]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/chromecast-with-google-tv-review-163024220.html">Chromecasts</a> and other devices powered by Google TV might give users access to free television channels in the future. According to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/chromecast-google-tv-fast-channels"><em>Protocol</em></a>, Google has been in talks with free, ad-supported streaming television providers about the possibility of adding their channels to its smart TV platform. Those channels typically have a similar feel to traditional TV, and its shows will be interrupted by commercial breaks.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Protocol</em> says Chromecast users might be able to browse live channels available to them through a dedicated menu similar to YouTube TV&#39;s. Meanwhile, smart TVs powered by the platform might show the free channels alongside other over-the-air programming that can be accessed with an antenna. The publication says that&#39;s similar to how companies like Samsung present free TV offerings on their own platforms. Samsung&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-tv-plus-streaming-service-web-034944264.html">free TV service</a> has become so popular, other companies (including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-channel-tribeca-film-festival-channel-172006958.html">Roku</a> and Amazon) started giving their customers access to hundreds of free channels, as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The addition of linear programming to Google TV could help make Chromecasts and smart TVs powered by the operating system a more enticing option for cord-cutters. Google could officially launch free streaming channels as soon as this fall, though it could also wait to announce the feature until its smart TV partners are also ready to do so next year. <em>Protocol</em> also says that while it&#39;s unclear what channels are making their way to the platform at this point, Google will likely strike deals that will give it access to &quot;dozens of free channels&quot; all at once.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-tv-free-channels-121535336.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e7beaf1-d83a-4be3-8a38-24e51d44a174</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 12:15:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631879994</ingested><modified>2021-09-17T12:00:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f86bd830-17a6-11ec-bf25-73e4b6908e66" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f86bd830-17a6-11ec-bf25-73e4b6908e66" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google TV]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[OnePlus 9 phones get a 'Hasselblad Xpan' camera setting]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OnePlus started using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-and-9-pro-official-141121859.html"><ins>camera tech from Hasselblad</ins></a> in its latest flagship smartphones, the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro. It&#39;ll be some time before we see the full impact of that partnership in the form custom camera hardware. In the meantime, OnePlus is looking to bring more of a Hasselblad feel to its current phones. The latest software update for the 9-series handsets, which OnePlus has started rolling out, includes a setting that aims to replicate the look of Hasselblad&#39;s XPan film cameras.</p><p>The Xpan Mode includes an aspect ratio of 65:21 and a very wide mode with two focal lengths (30mm and 45mm). The image preview has the frame lines that you&#39;d see through the lens of an XPan camera, OnePlus says, and after you take a shot, you can see an animation of negative film developing. There are two film simulation effects too — color and black and white — with Hasselblad working with OnePlus to create the latter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The update looks to improve the phones&#39; camera systems in other ways. OnePlus says it has updated the memory optimization solution and shortened the time it takes to launch the camera app by up to half. The company says it has reduced lag in previews and fixed over-sharpening in various auto mode situations. It also claims to have improved dynamic range in low-light conditions and bolstered the success rate when it comes to shooting moving objects, while reducing noise and optimizing HDR frame retrieving algorithms for some scenes.</p><p>OnePlus says the update includes some other improvements for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html"><ins>OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro</ins></a><ins>,</ins> including wireless charging optimization and the latest Android security patch.

Apple announced four new iPhones this week at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/iphone%202021">hardware event</a>, mirroring the last year&#39;s offerings. The new iPhone 13 and 13 mini feature smaller notches at the top of their touchscreens, the new A15 Bionic processor and longer battery lives. The higher-end iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max smartphones have fancy finishes, 120Hz Super Retina XDR displays, and improved cameras along with the A15 Bionic chipset and better battery lives.

Both the iPhone 13 and 13 mini have a nearly identical design to last year&#39;s iPhone 12s, but they have a 20-percent small notch at the top and screens that are 28-percent brighter.

While screen sizes haven&#39;t changed, both the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max have new Super Retina XDR displays with ProMotion, 1,000 nits of brightness and refresh rates up to 120Hz.

It now features a new 77mm telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom, along with a new ultra wide camera that has a f/1.8 aperture and autofocus. The primary &quot;wide&quot; camera is the largest Apple has even put in an iPhone and it features a f/1.5 aperture and 1.9-micron pixels. Apple also made it possible to shoot at up to 6x optical zoom, enabling macro photography, and it added new features like Cinematic Mode for videos, which uses machine learning to get things like better focus, better low-light performance, Time-lapse and Slo-mo video and more.</p><p>Inside the Pros is the A15 Bionic chipset with a 16-core neural engine, which Apple says will help the iPhones run 50 percent faster than the competition. The company also touts the handsets&#39; enhanced durability and battery life. The iPhone 13 Pro series includes a surgical-grade stainless steel band and finishes that are resistant to abrasions and corrosions, and the lineup is IP68 water-resistant. As far as battery life goes, the iPhone 13 Pro should last 1.5 hours more than the iPhone 12 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max will last up to 2.5 hours longer than its predecessor.</p><p>As for configurations, the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max come in 128GB, 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage capacities and both are available in four colors: sierra blue, silver, gold and graphite.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-the-iphone-13-iphone-13-mini-iphone-13-pro-and-iphone-13-pro-max-113024712.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb123e1f-12bc-431c-9f83-45e7a3902265</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 11:30:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631801935</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T14:18:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ccc0cba0-158a-11ec-b817-5941bf03c2e2" width="1960" height="1306" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ccc0cba0-158a-11ec-b817-5941bf03c2e2" width="1960" height="1306" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[All colors, from RED to pink]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: We review the new GoPro Hero 10]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s been a decade, more or less, since GoPro crested into the mainstream as the name in small, portable, rugged action cameras. Since then, the company has continued to refine its flagship product, all while defending itself from cheaper fly-by-night competitors. Our James Trew has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gopro-hero-10-review-a-big-invisible-upgrade-130041612.html">reviewed the new GoPro Hero 10 Black</a>, which can shoot footage in 5.3K and take 23-megapixel stills from inside that notoriously sturdy housing.</p><p>We won’t spoil the bones of his review, but suffice to say the improvements in hardware and shooting technology are certainly welcome. Sadly, you might see a hit in battery life, but GoPro says customers aren’t trying to shoot theatrical movies on a single charge. If there’s one thing James really wasn’t a fan of, though, it was the price, which is $50 more than the last model, even if you subscribe to GoPro’s unlimited cloud backup service.</p><p>— Dan Cooper</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-asus-rog-gaming-collection-us-uk-october-130003972.html"><strong>IKEA&#39;s ASUS ROG gaming collection comes to the US and UK this October</strong></a></h2><h3>But beware the dangers of the gamer tax</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-asus-rog-gaming-collection-us-uk-october-130003972.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6ab2f7d0-17a1-11ec-bd71-cda6dc9d63a6" style="height:380;width:675;" alt="IKEA / ASUS" data-uuid="bbaebe76-080b-3a94-8f0f-c2e83338075f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA / ASUS</div></figure></a><p>IKEA and ASUS’ Republic of Gamers division teamed up last year to build more gamer-friendly furniture and gear.

According to a recent investigation conducted by <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/cc3e3854-5f76-4422-a970-9010c3bc732b"><em>The Financial Times</em></a> and cyber intelligence group Cyberint, though, there&#39;s been &quot;a 100 percent-plus rise in Telegram usage by cybercriminals&quot; recently. And <em>FT</em> says the rise in criminal activity on the app came after users flocked to it following a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-facebook-data-sharing-205451955.html">change</a> in WhatsApp&#39;s privacy policy.</p><p>If you&#39;ll recall, WhatsApp asked its users to accept a revised policy allowing it to share data with its parent company Facebook earlier this year. Users were outraged, and WhatsApp had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-privacy-policy-changes-statement-encryption-surveillance-172224753.html">clarify</a> that it still won&#39;t be able to read their private communications. Even so, people migrated to rivals offering secure similar messaging capabilities — for Telegram, that has apparently led to a rise in criminal activity conducted through the app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the investigators, there&#39;s a ballooning network of hackers sharing and selling data leaks in channels with tens of thousands of subscribers. The number of times &quot;Email:pass&quot; and &quot;Combo&quot; were mentioned in the app over the past year reportedly rose fourfold. Some data dumps circulating on the app contain 300,000 to 600,000 email and password combinations for gaming and email services. Cybercriminals are also selling financial information, such as credit card numbers, passport copies and hacking tools through the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Tal Samra, cyber threat analyst at Cyberint, explained: &quot;Its encrypted messaging service is increasingly popular among threat actors conducting fraudulent activity and selling stolen data ... as it is more convenient to use than the dark web.&quot; In addition to being more convenient than the dark web, Telegram is also less likely to be monitored by authorities, Samra said.&nbsp;</p><p>Telegram has removed the channel where the massive datasets with email and password combos are being sold after <em>FT</em> notified the company. In a statement, Telegram also said that it “has a policy for removing personal data shared without consent&quot; and that it has an &quot;ever growing force of professional moderators&quot; removing 10,000 public communities every day for violating its TOS. Earlier this year, those moderators had to monitor hundreds of channels to keep an eye out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telegram-us-calls-for-violence-230100510.html">for calls of violence</a> following the attack on the US Capitol.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/telegram-sharp-rise-cybercriminal-activities-072559131.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4a87096a-1fc1-4be0-9bc6-31ed1786994a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 07:25:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631862855</ingested><modified>2021-09-17T07:14:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/681fccd0-1780-11ec-bffb-29bcd45fae2f" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/681fccd0-1780-11ec-bffb-29bcd45fae2f" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Olga Ihnatsyeva via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOGILEV, BELARUS-SEPTEMBER 18, 2019: Smartphone screen with icons of the social network Instagram, Skype, Telegram]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Smartphone screen with icons of the social network Instagram, Skype, Telegram]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Ken Block's Hoonigan team build a real life 'Halo' Warthog vehicle]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ken Block&#39;s Hoonigan Industries has built a fully functional <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-02-02-real-life-halo-warthog-goes-for-a-test-drive.html">Warthog</a> vehicle, and the team is showing us the process it went through in a new series on YouTube.

The company builds a bunch of useful tools for making the most of your electronic music setup, but its specially designed <a href="https://www.retrokits.com/shop/rk002/">MIDI cable</a> that adds features like velocity control to the Volca FM have proven quite popular. The latest member of its lineup though, is quite a bit more ambitious.</p><p>The RK-008 is a full fledged MIDI control center. It&#39;s an eight track MIDI sequencer and recorder, which allows it to be the glue that keeps your rig together. It also has a built-in metronome to help you stay in time with your instruments, which is important since all MIDI data is recorded unquantized. (Though you can quantize it after the fact, and then undo if you prefer to go back to your original sloppy playing.)&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="662eff2bdda24c2d87570aeb887441a1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wjl4o9zIHj8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Each track can record on multiple channels, so you can actually control multiple devices from a single track, leaving the other seven open for... even more devices? You can even record eight parts across the eight tracks, then consolidate them down to one, freeing up more room for sequencing. And of course you can overdub or overwrite any performances.</p><p>Each of the tracks can be manipulated independently too. Allowing you to quantize them, add swing or transpose them. And it&#39;s all non-destructive, so you can easily undo your changes.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s also a simple step sequencer built-in to the RK-008. It&#39;s probably not gonna work for complex chords, but does the job just fine it seems for four on the floor drums.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s two MIDI inputs and two MIDI outputs on the back, plus a separate dedicated sync port. Tracks can be assigned to one or both outputs, which is handy if you&#39;ve got that one drum machine that insists on having each instrument on a separate channel. The two in ports means you can merge MIDI from different sources, but also use different controllers for different instruments.</p><p>It&#39;s quite a feature list as is, and Retrokits says there&#39;s still more to be revealed, which is incredibly impressive for something that looks like pocket calculator from the 1980s — and I mean that as a good thing. The RK-008 looks part <a href="https://www.engadget.com/akai-mpc-one-retro-music-production-machine-142916111.html">MPC</a>, part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:HP29C.jpg">HP calculator</a>, could probably fit in a pocket and yet seems capable of controlling an entire live music rig.&nbsp;</p><p>There are still some outstanding questions though, most importantly when it will come out and how much it will cost. But hopefully we&#39;ll find out sooner than later.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/retrokits-rk-008-midi-sequencer-recorder-pocket-calculator-superbooth-232319863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">943a46ee-2f3f-4771-8b7e-c8ceb35c81d8</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 23:23:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631834161</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T23:16:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8118da20-1743-11ec-befd-a713b4634039" width="2000" height="1377" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8118da20-1743-11ec-befd-a713b4634039" width="2000" height="1377" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Retrokits]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Retrokits RK-008]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Retrokits RK-008]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rivian announces membership plan with complimentary charging and LTE connectivity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With R1T trucks <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-production-mileston-223055949.html">rolling off the assembly line</a> at its factory in Normal, Illinois, Rivian continues to prepare for the official debut of its first EVs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">later this month</a>.

He&#39;s best known for his namesake company&#39;s ZX computers, which thrived in the UK during the early 1980s — he succeeded in making home PCs accessible at a time when most models were still major expenses. A ZX Spectrum 16K, for instance, cost £125 where Apple launched the Apple II for $1,298 just a few years earlier.</p><p>Sinclair is also widely credited with having invented the first pocket calculator, the Sinclair Executive, in 1972. Texas Instruments&#39; first programmable calculator (the HP-65) didn&#39;t arrive until 1974. He was an early pioneer of electric transportation, too, having developed the C5 electric tricycle in 1985.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Like many inventors, his projects didn&#39;t always succeed. Sinclair&#39;s computer business ran into trouble in 1984 with the ill-fated QL, and he sold the company to Amstrad in 1985. And while the C5 may have been decades ahead of its time, that didn&#39;t translate to sales. Sinclairs&#39; vehicle business ran aground less than a year after the C5&#39;s debut.</p><p>Sinclair&#39;s legacy is clear, however. For many gamers and game developers, Sinclair&#39;s computers represented a watershed moment. McGill University <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/wikispeedia/wpcd/wp/z/ZX_Spectrum.htm">noted</a> that many famous creators and studios, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-28-no-fable-creator-peter-molyneux-isnt-retiring-today.html">Peter Molyneux</a>, David Perry and Rare, cut their teeth on ZX Spectrums. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ti-bans-assembly-programs-on-calculators-002335088.html">Pocket calculators</a> are still useful even in the smartphone era.

He was one of the first to obtain the revised model and what he found after tearing down the console was that Sony had equipped it with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-revision-smaller-heatsink-142922979.html">smaller and lighter heatsink</a>. In testing the unit, Evans found exhaust temperatures were higher than on the launch variant, leading him to claim it &quot;worse&quot; than its predecessor. That&#39;s a statement that led to controversy, and, in some cases, confusion over whether people should buy the updated CFI-1100 model.</p><div id="e6770106768941829959993a8de260a2"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y8-97fwkO78?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Now we have a more definitive answer on what the new heatsink means for the PlayStation 5. Working together, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2021-playstation-5-cfi-1100-review-better-or-worse-than-the-launch-console"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/VgWuGA8cExo"><em>Gamers Nexus</em></a> conducted an independent teardown and analysis of the console. The short answer of what they found is that &quot;in all practical terms, there is no meaningful difference between PS5s old and new.&quot; The longer answer is that the new PS5&#39;s cooling performance is more complicated than was first reported.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to featuring a new thermal assembly, Sony tweaked the motherboard and baseplate found in the refreshed PS5. The result of those changes is some components run cooler while others get hotter. However, <em>Digital Foundry</em> states, &quot;there is no evidence that this presents anything worth worrying about, assuming you are keeping your PS5 in a well-ventilated area.&quot;</p><p>Critically, the outlet found that once it installed the latest firmware from Sony, there was also no difference in performance between the new and old models. Both variants will pull as much power as they need to maintain a sufficient boost clock and throttle their fans to limit noise. Even as both consoles get hotter, you won&#39;t notice a dip in performance in the way you would with a PC GPU. Either way, should they hit a critical temperature where their components are in danger, both will automatically shut down to prevent damage.</p><div id="cbde2620e14c4dc79058b5137f865655"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jEccWyHUXYY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;The core question of whether the new PS5 is better or worse than the launch model can be answered by saying that they&#39;re mostly much the same, certainly in terms of the end-user experience,&quot; according to <em>Digital Foundry</em>.</p><p>The main takeaway from the analysis conducted by the outlets<em>&nbsp;</em>is that you can safely buy the updated model. You don&#39;t need to go out of your way to find the launch variant. In fact, it&#39;s probably best you avoid doing so since many scalpers have tried to take advantage of the fallout from the initial video Evans posted by selling their launch models for even more money.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-cfi-1100-digital-foundry-analysis-204522648.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">34ec9751-168f-4b43-b62f-3cc226455c12</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 20:45:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631825126</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T20:45:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/4a4f6a40-2b62-11eb-bcf7-7e7a1467ff46" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/4a4f6a40-2b62-11eb-bcf7-7e7a1467ff46" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Riot is the latest developer to release its own game launcher]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you tired of game developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-17-rockstar-games-launcher-pc.html">releasing launchers</a> that feel redundant? Too bad, you&#39;re getting another one. Riot Games has <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/new-riot-client-coming-soon">revealed</a> plans to roll out a launcher for its games, Riot Client. It&#39;s not strictly new (games have been quietly using a limited version of the launcher for a while), but you now have access to all of Riot&#39;s desktop titles with a single sign-in.

It&#39;s not quite the classic case of inserting another layer between you and the games you want to play. At the same time, there&#39;s little doubt this helps Riot control the experience. A client like this will make it that much easier for Riot to keep you within its game universe — why jump to <em>Counter-Strike</em> when <em>Valorant</em> is that much easier to reach?</p><div id="21da34b848794e4493cabde6a39b928e"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/STq3rFUtqBE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/riot-client-194938116.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dc42f0ff-f00f-4164-b2a9-d02fcdad61b5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 19:49:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631821623</ingested><modified>2021-09-17T02:39:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b43f3190-1722-11ec-bf5f-e973cf65eeac" width="1920" height="1081" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b43f3190-1722-11ec-bf5f-e973cf65eeac" width="1920" height="1081" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Riot Client featuring 'Valorant']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Riot Client featuring 'Valorant']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Recreate 'Space Oddity' sounds with a Bowie-edition Stylophone]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>David Bowie famously used a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/stylophone"><ins>Stylophone</ins></a> on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-04-chris-hadfield-space-oddity-is-back-baby.html"><ins>&quot;Space Oddity&quot;</ins></a> all the way back in 1969.

Filming is underway on a heist thriller series called <em>Jigsaw</em> (which has nothing to do with the Saw movies, as best I can tell). Although it won&#39;t be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-wwe-interactive-horror-movie-escape-the-undertaker-the-new-day-185934596.html"><ins>an interactive project</ins></a> like <em>Black Mirror: Bandersnatch</em> or <em>Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt: Kimmy vs. the Reverend</em>, it&#39;s a non-linear show. According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/netflix-series-jigsaw-giancarlo-esposito-paz-vega-rufus-sewell-1235015071/"><em><ins>The Hollywood Reporter,</ins></em></a> you can watch the first seven episodes in any order leading up to the finale, similar to Paramount+ series <em>Interrogation.</em></p><p><em>Jigsaw </em>is loosely based on a real story in which $70 billion in Wall Street bearer bonds were at risk due to flood waters caused by Hurricane Sandy. The story spans 25 years, from decades before the heist to a year afterward.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The show has a solid cast, with Giancarlo Esposito, Paz Vega, Rufus Sewell and Jai Courtney among those involved. <em>Breaking Bad </em>and <em>The Mandalorian </em>star Esposito will play a veteran thief who can&#39;t stay away from a life of crime. Vega, meanwhile, plays an attorney who goes above and beyond to protect those close to her.</p><p>Ridley Scott is among the executive producers of the series, which was created by showrunner Erica Garcia. There&#39;s no release date for <em>Jigsaw</em> just yet, but it&#39;s maybe worth keeping an eye out for so you can put the puzzle pieces together when it arrives.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-nonlinear-heist-series-jigsaw-giancarlo-esposito-paz-vega-183505378.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4d841ec5-11c0-4cb6-ba13-6d3ca567f412</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 18:35:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631817309</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T18:35:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/12aec710-171c-11ec-b5de-e62f4aa561e7" width="3500" height="2284" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/12aec710-171c-11ec-b5de-e62f4aa561e7" width="3500" height="2284" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mario Anzuoni / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Actor Giancarlo Esposito poses at the premiere for "El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie" in Los Angeles, California, U.S., October 7, 2019.

During a call with reporters, the company’s head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher said the policy is necessary because bad actors are increasingly trying to “blur the lines” between authentic and inauthentic behavior.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“We are seeing groups that pose a risk of significant social harm, that also engage in violations on our platform, but don&#39;t necessarily rise to the level for either of those where we’d enforce against for inauthenticity under CIB [coordinated inauthentic behavior] or under our dangerous organizations policy,” Gleicher said. “So this protocol is designed to capture these groups that are sort of in between spaces.”</p><p>Gleicher added that the new protocols could help Facebook address networks of accounts spreading anti-vaccine misinformation or groups trying to organize political violence. In announcing the change, Facebook said it took down a small network of accounts in Germany that were linked to the “Querdenken” movement, which has spread conspiracy theories about the country COVID-19 restrictions and has been “linked to off-platform violence.”</p><p>Facebook said it could take “a range of actions” in enforcing its new rules around coordinated social harm. That could include banning accounts — as it did with the “Querdenken” movement — or throttling their reach to prevent content from spreading as widely.</p><p>The issue of how to handle groups that break Facebook’s rules in a coordinated way has been a difficult one for the company, which up until now has primarily focused on taking down networks that rely on fake accounts to manipulate its platform. The issue came up earlier this year following the January 6th insurrection as Facebook investigated the “Stop the Steal” movement. According to an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-stop-the-steal-policies-report-205339822.html"><ins>internal report </ins></a>obtained by <em>BuzzFeed News</em>, Facebook employees suggested its existing policies weren’t equipped to handle “inherently harmful” coordination by legitimate accounts, which prevented it from realizing “Stop the Steal” was a “cohesive movement” until it was too late.</p><p>During a press call, Gleicher said that the “work on this policy started well before January 6th.” But he added that the company’s work against high-profile groups had informed their decision making. “If you think about our enforcement against QAnon-related actors, if you think about our enforcement against ‘Stop the Steal,’ if you think about our enforcement against other groups — we learned from all of them.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-coordinated-social-harm-180601493.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9a0098f4-4165-478e-a164-dd76101a4ce9</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Sep 2021 18:06:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631815561</ingested><modified>2021-09-16T18:06:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/bf05fe00-5501-11e9-bfe5-db90a6a6fae8" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-04/bf05fe00-5501-11e9-bfe5-db90a6a6fae8" width="2200" height="1467" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The entrance sign to Facebook headquarters is seen through two moving buses in Menlo Park, California, on Wednesday, October 10, 2018.
