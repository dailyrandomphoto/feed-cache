There were direct-to-video features for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury" href="https://amzn.to/2XMnUXy"><em>Chronicles of Riddick</em></a>, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Van Helsing: The London Assignment" href="https://amzn.to/3nVxtOO"><em>Van Helsing</em></a> and, the most famous project of them all, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:The Animatrix" href="https://amzn.to/2XQUSGt"><em>The Animatrix</em></a>. Nearly 20 years later, streaming reigns supreme and services like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/P0ab6Y">Disney+</a> seem to be returning to the idea, but bigger and grander with shows like <em>Marvel’s What If…?</em> and <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Visions</em>, premiering this week, is probably the more ambitious of the two, enlisting talent from various Japanese anime studios to create short films about different aspects of the Star Wars universe. The list includes juggernauts like Trigger (<em>Kill la Kill</em>, <em>Promare</em>) Production I.G (<em>Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex</em>, <em>Haikyu!!</em>) and Science SARU (<em>Devilman Crybaby</em>, <em>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</em>). Unlike <em>The Animatrix</em>, Lucasfilm was content to mostly hand over the reins to these studios, creating shorts that differ in tone, style and, most notably, continuity.</p><div id="8f7ba6f5a1b94859941915a23b26ee32"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jtAsl-0o3O0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Robot Jedi? Sith twins? Intergalactic rock band whose members include a Hutt and a former Jedi padawan? It’s an intriguing array of concepts, but as a long-time Star Wars fan I couldn’t tell you how they fit into the timeline. If they fit in, at all. <em>Visions</em> is more about taking some base concepts — the Force, the Jedi, the Sith — and playing around with them in each studio’s unique style. It reminds me the most of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Batman: Gotham Knight " href="https://amzn.to/3kvlSnn"><em>Batman: Gotham Knight </em></a>from 2008, a collection of shorts also by various anime studios, including Production I.G. The one thing that DC Entertainment has always had going for it is the variety of TV and movie adaptations it’s had going on independently of each other, where audiences just understood that these weren’t meant to be connected in any way.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/243f9510-1c79-11ec-9f4b-f269c5dbee91" alt="Force-user and droid" data-uuid="e3aa1448-ce59-3e5a-97b8-f74e67842ad0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lucasfilm</div></figure><p>However, even for DC things have been changing in that regard, especially after last year’s “Crisis on Infinite Earths” crossover. For years now, the TV “Berlanti-verse” has been flirting with continuity, not just in how <em>The Flash</em> was a spinoff of <em>Arrow</em> and <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> was a spinoff of both, but even having the Flash and Supergirl meet up even though they were on different networks and in different universes.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/74bbdbf0-1c76-11ec-bbbe-de5ef0b676d4" alt="Grant Gustin and Melissa Benoit" data-uuid="c9e11686-5ad1-3732-bcfa-1e3074284795"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DC</div></figure><p>“Crisis” upped the ante by merging these separate worlds in the end, while also confirming almost every other DC-based TV show as part of the bigger multiverse. It was great for fans who obsessively watch every comic book program they can, but less so for people who would rather keep their viewing limited and compartmentalized.</p><p>On the other side, Marvel didn’t have the same deep catalog as DC did, with its live-action MCU franchise only taking off 13 years ago. Marvel Studios was perfectly happy to wipe the slate clean of everything that had come before, from the 1989 <em>Punisher</em> film to 2007’s <em>Ghost Rider</em> with Nicolas Cage. Since then everything live-action has tied into the universe somehow, including Netflix shows like <em>Daredevil</em>, Hulu shows like <em>Runaways</em> and the Freeform show <em>Cloak &amp; Dagger</em>. This was great for someone committed to the franchise, but could be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-star-wars-marvel-universe-canon-continuity-120159180.html">daunting to casual viewers</a>.</p><div id="d9cfb822275e479f85eb6b218d3aef23"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qRpd4lj69ZY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>It also presented some creative constraints. Everything Marvel now had to fit in with the larger MCU somehow, so once a character appeared another movie or show couldn’t present its own take on the same person (alas, poor Inhumans). They couldn’t have world-shaking events outside of, say, the Avengers films — at least, not without making some kind of excuse why Captain America or Thor couldn’t just come charging in. Everything had to be carefully planned out as the universe expanded and connected internally.</p><p>That’s partly why the show <em>What If…?</em> exists. Sure, it’s based on a pre-existing comic series, but what both show and comic do is allow creators free rein with the characters and events of the Marvel Universe, experimenting to see what would happen if you change one or two things. Though this week’s is hardly a “slight” difference.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/01464b40-1c78-11ec-bdfd-80e3ce750f64" alt="Thor and some " data-uuid="f2626e86-4981-3e32-9ed6-f0b563486ebd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>The point of divergence here is that Odin doesn’t adopt Loki as his son, leaving Thor to become an arrogant, spoiled child who prefers to party rather than take his duties as the would-be king of Asgard seriously. How is he still worthy of Mjolnir? We have no idea and the episode isn’t interested in telling us. Instead we’re shown how Thor likes to take the Warriors Three on long benders across the galaxy, with his next destination being the “backwater” of Earth. And everyone’s invited — Drax, Rocket, Howard the Duck, the Grandmaster and even Loki and the other ice giants who somehow, are friends with Thor <em>anyway</em> in this reality. When you consider why and how these characters got involved in the “main” timeline in the first place, it really doesn’t add up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/63b592e0-1c78-11ec-9f0f-73f461f9c3e1" alt="Captain Marvel, Frigga and Thor" data-uuid="3915a3bb-f277-37f9-b8c4-376ae8db8f6b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>You could just try to enjoy it at face value, as just a silly story  with no larger bearing on continuity. However, the point has been made repeatedly that this show is technically, in continuity, and not just in the sense that the Marvel Universe consists of many realities and everything is valid somewhere. While other comics and shows can be given an official universe “number” like 616 or 1,999,999 and just written off as a huge divergence from what we know, the concept of <em>What If…?</em> is that it shows us incremental changes from the MCU in particular. But the divergences shown in this week’s episode are far more than incremental, with an offbeat, cartoonish tone to match. It’s the least <em>What If</em>-like <em>What If…?</em> installment so far.</p><p>Unfortunately, like most of the episodes so far, it still ends on a downbeat, one that’s sort of rushed in and not explained. I can’t even imagine how we ended up with a Vision-Ultron hybrid in possession of the Infinity Stones and, unless this episode gets a sequel, it doesn’t really matter. The ending is just a non sequitur to affirm, as every episode does, that the regular MCU sequence of events is the “correct one.” It’s tacked on, and makes what was already a messy adventure even worse.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/cd5ab590-1c78-11ec-affb-452e5e4a6ee0" alt="Padawan and Jedi Master" data-uuid="42003a17-c357-354c-af54-b91314ad61bc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lucasfilm</div></figure><p>This is where the strength of <em>Star Wars: Visions</em> lies. There’s no attempt to tie the episodes to each other or the larger Star Wars universe. It lets each installment stand on its own as an homage to the larger “ideas” of Star Wars, while also showcasing the idiosyncrasies of each studio. The third episode, “The Twins,” is a great example of this in action. There’s a lightsaber fight on the hull of a Star Destroyer! No one is wearing environmental suits! They’re yelling at each other despite a lack of air! People’s clothes explode off their bodies! It doesn’t make a damn lick of sense, but it doesn’t have to, because it’s not meant to be more than a bit of fun.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-visions-marvel-studios-what-if-season-one-153109359.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9e71fb83-d098-4886-bbda-2698cae54b38</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 15:31:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632411073</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T15:31:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d8142400-1c76-11ec-9fc6-7db93704f496" width="1920" height="816" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d8142400-1c76-11ec-9fc6-7db93704f496" width="1920" height="816" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucasfilm]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Girl handles a black-bladed lightsaber]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Star Wars: Visions]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Europe may require all phone manufacturers to use USB-C charging]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Europe may require all manufacturers to use USB-C charging for all phones and electronic devices, according to a new EU Commission <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_4613">ruling proposal</a>. It aims to reduce e-waste and &quot;consumer inconvenience&quot; caused by different and incompatible chargers still in use. The Commission also wants manufacturers to unbundle the sale of chargers with electronic devices.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;With today&#39;s proposal... USB-C will become the standard port for all smartphones, tablets, cameras, headphones, portable speakers and handheld videogame consoles,&quot; according to the report.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The EU said its work with industry has managed to reduce the number of mobile phone chargers from 30 to 3 over the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-12-29-european-standardization-bodies-formalize-micro-usb-cellphone-ch.html">last decade</a>. One of those three is Apple&#39;s Lightning port used by around 20 percent of devices sold in Europe. The EU hopes to change that situation, according to a statement by executive VP Margrethe Vestager:</p><blockquote><p>European consumers were frustrated long enough about incompatible chargers piling up in their drawers. We gave industry plenty of time to come up with their own solutions, now time is ripe for legislative action for a common charger. This is an important win for our consumers and environment and in line with our green and digital ambitions.</p></blockquote><p>When a common charger was first voted on by the EU <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-european-union-wants-common-charging-cable-standard.html">last year</a>, Apple issued a statement saying that the proposal would &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-23-apple-rejects-eu-call-for-common-phone-charger.html">stifle innovation</a>,&quot; and its position has not changed. &quot;We remain concerned that strict regulation mandating just one type of connector stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, which in turn will harm consumers in Europe and around the world,&quot; an Apple spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58665809"><em>BBC</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the launch of the iPhone 12, however, Apple has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-2021-environmental-progress-report-iphone-12-power-adapter-144626760.html">stopped including</a> chargers in the box, something it said would save 861,000 tons of copper, zinc and tin. Apple itself now uses USB-C charging on its latest Mac laptops and certain iPad models, since that standard supports higher voltage charging required for larger devices.</p><p>Nearly all Android smartphones now use USB-C charging, and many models from Samsung and others are sold with charging/data cables but not chargers. It total, around 420 million mobile phones and other portable electronic devices sold in Europe just in the last year.</p><p>The EU throws away 12,000 tons of chargers each year, some unused, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-23/iphones-may-need-redesign-as-eu-pushes-for-common-charger"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. At the same time, consumers spend around 2.4 billion euros ($2.8 billion) on standalone chargers not included with devices. The law is still in the proposal stages and needs to be passed by EU lawmakers and governments, so it could come into force around two years after that.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/europe-proposes-usb-c-as-a-common-charger-for-electronic-devices-131605815.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b5a41212-fbbf-4825-9b4f-6ecbe5b48669</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 13:16:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632402968</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T13:16:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f4d810a0-1c68-11ec-97ee-bdaf0c2ff766" width="4000" height="2654" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f4d810a0-1c68-11ec-97ee-bdaf0c2ff766" width="4000" height="2654" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vadym  Plysiuk via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Man connecting USB Type C Port Cable for charging to the smartphone.

All that’s left for Starfleet to do is to drop him off at the Daystrom Institute, which isn’t the most glamorous of jobs, so of course Beckett Mariner and Bradward Boimler end up on this particular babysitting gig.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6747baa0-1b15-11ec-befe-01ad643a0094" style="height:675;width:1200;" alt="" data-uuid="9dc9a6fe-b0df-3c1b-8f0d-8f7da5c9a029"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>A gravimetric shear complicates things for the pair, forcing their shuttle to crash on a barren world with only the pleading voice of Agimus to keep them company. The computer uses this opportunity to pit the two against each other, continuing a plot thread that we thought had been settled two episodes ago. Beckett still doesn’t trust Brad&#39;s abilities despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-four-070120756.html">all they’ve</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-070123812.html">been through</a>. It feels like a regression or perhaps even a mis-scheduled episode, except that we the audience still see his growth while his supposed best friend doubts him. It’s a plot line unlikely to go away after a few episodes, reaffirming this show’s commitment to character-driven storytelling.</p><p>However, that breadth of characterization doesn’t really apply to Agimus. He’s really just… kind of a jerk, and he doesn’t have the ability to directly influence anything due to his lack of arms and legs. Boimler and Mariner spend the entire episode lugging his box around: a sentient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin">MacGuffin</a>. If you’re not familiar with that term, it means an item (or person) that moves the plot forward and motivates the characters, but is not actually important in itself. With Agimus’s reign over, he really just serves here to get Mariner and Boimler at each other’s throats.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/42e1cc00-1b15-11ec-adbf-2104cc27ab8d" style="height:675;width:1200;" alt="" data-uuid="4f10a205-4e76-3010-a036-53e886aadc79"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p></p><p>His status as a sentient being is never in question, but the problem of what to do with him as his behavior worsens goes in directions that would never come up for an organic individual. Mariner suggests burying him, a suggestion turned down by Boimler because he’s a sentient being and that’s not what Starfleet does. So it seems we have made some progress from the ol’ “destroy them with their own logic” days of <em>TOS</em>. But then the two ensigns end up burying him anyway, while Agamus protests that “he has rights!”</p><p>And yet Star Trek has always been a bit sketchy about what those rights are. While episodes like “<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Measure_Of_A_Man_(episode)">The Measure of a Man</a>” and “<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Offspring_(episode)">The Offspring</a>” have reaffirmed Data’s humanity, it’s been contradicted since by events on <em>Voyager</em> and <em>Picard</em>. The Doctor asserted <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Author,_Author_(episode)">his authorial rights to a holonovel he created and won</a>, but wasn’t actually recognized as a person. The question <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-star-trek-picard-technology-evolution.html">remained unanswered</a> nearly 20 years later on <em>Picard</em>, with us only being shown holograms of limited capabilities, or those based on the personalities of other sentient beings (Rios’ crew). And fully synthetic beings like Data, ones with brains <em>and</em> bodies, were illegal after the attack on Mars.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/84867430-1b15-11ec-b7be-eb71c85bddb1" style="height:675;width:1200;" alt="" data-uuid="24be9bec-ac44-3c75-937e-7c468548ceb2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p><em>Lower Decks</em> takes place a mere year after the end of <em>Voyager</em>, so it’s free to pick up and explore some of those plot threads without that later baggage. But without a synthetic crew member on the <em>USS Cerritos</em> it can only glance off the subject. Agamus is dumped in a storage facility as just another “self-aware megalomaniacal computer,” not too dissimilar from <a href="https://youtu.be/TASlXWbMZyU">the warehouse</a> where the Ark of the Covenant is dumped at the end of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>. Is it a prison? Did he get a trial? Are he and the other computers just going to sit there until the end of the Federation? From an ethical perspective it isn’t great, but it’s unlikely to ever be fully addressed, because who in Starfleet is really going to fight for the personhood of a computerized fascist dictator?</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-seven-130034380.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c92b204-e76a-486d-80f2-c744968da0b5</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 13:00:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632254575</ingested><modified>2021-09-21T20:03:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e8b53b90-1b14-11ec-adde-8ac8b3144b18" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e8b53b90-1b14-11ec-adde-8ac8b3144b18" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Where Pleasant Fountains Lie"  Epi#207 -- Jerry O\'Connell as Commander and Jeffrey Combs as Agimus (computer) of the Paramount+ series STAR TREK: LOWER DECKS.

Most interesting, of course, is likely Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-easel-hinge-153618416.html"><ins>Surface Laptop Studio</ins></a>, a notebook with a screen that pulls forward just like its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-21-surface-studio-2-review.html"><ins>desktop namesake</ins></a>. This replacement for the Surface Book 3 also turns into a tablet-esque PC, although its stacked design may divide users.</p><p>As we surmised a few days back, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-13-inch-screen-dolby-vision-150951070.html"><ins>Surface Pro 8</ins></a> did get a fairly magnificent redesign with a new skinny-bezel, 13-inch 120Hz display, Thunderbolt 4 and new, faster internals. It’s been built with Windows 11 in mind and goes on sale when the new operating system arrives on October 5th. Thankfully, Microsoft allowed our chum Cherlynn Low behind the velvet rope to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-hands-on-surface-pro-8-pro-x-go-3-adaptive-kit-price-specs-160005455.html"><ins>spend a little time with the Laptop Studio and Pro 8, so read this for all the juicy details</ins></a>.</p><p>Much as with the band U2, we also need to discuss the “other two” members of the lineup, the Surface Pro X and the Surface Go 3. For the former, the only real news is the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-x-wifi-only-899-usd-151558748.html"><ins>new, cheaper WiFi-only model, which retails for $899</ins></a>, and the bundling of Windows 11. Similarly, the Surface Go 3 (arguably the Larry Mullen Jr. of Surface tablets) gets faster chip options but is, in most other regards, the same affordable but deeply underpowered device we already know and, uh, <em>love</em>.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-hands-on-price-specs-buggy-update-triple-camera-160008199.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb251380-1c5b-11ec-bb87-c174e905a4cd" style="height:450;width:675;" alt="Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="c663c007-c55a-3400-94dc-d1548818c6e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low</div></figure></a><p>On the mobile front, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-annoucement-152736648.html"><ins>Surface Duo 2</ins></a>, its second-generation dual-screen Android smartphone.

It’s a set of add-ons that can help people with accessibility needs get around their Surface devices more easily.

They&#39;re designed to be carried around by the wind and could be used in numerous applications including disease and air pollution tracking, according to a paper published by <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03847-y.epdf?sharing_token=H_ir9bfrqhQ2lsW0udPg7tRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NHZkfDUEKmhjTX15axDSP-EqNRoRAgjNvE6EgxUSns1ObKU5SUSYUOHSWqZ9JANy9Q6W9_XUSRUaunfaoZagd0JEEDFEcyG2SX3x8NHC-DnDrqqnfXavjw1lkDTh94pHLKNh-JhwCeItdJXrbLXUTKVw1qqCBB4z7eIWvQjUOatQ%3D%3D&amp;tracking_referrer=www.vice.com"><em>Nature</em></a>. At the same time, they could be made from biodegradable materials to prevent environmental contamination.&nbsp;</p><p>The design of the flyers was inspired by spinning seeds from cottonwood and other trees. Those fall slowly by spinning like helicopters so they can be picked up by the wind and spread a long distance from the tree, increasing the range of the species.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The team from Northwest University ran with that idea but made it better, and smaller. &quot;We think we&#39;ve beaten biology... we&#39;ve been able to build structures that fall in a more stable trajectory at slower terminal velocities than equivalent seeds,&quot; said lead Professor John A. Rogers. &quot;The other thing... was that we were able to make these helicopter flyer structures that are much smaller than seeds you would see in the natural world.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div id="65e38b6b46f048418c0286293226bb57"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3me68t6Kh0I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>They&#39;re not so small that the aerodynamics starts to break down, though. &quot;All of the advantages of the helicopter design begin to disappear below a certain length scale, so we pushed it all the way, as far as you can go or as physics would allow,&quot; Rogers told <em>Vice</em>. &quot;Below that size scale, everything looks and falls like a sphere.&quot;</p><p>The devices are also large enough to carry electronics, sensors and power sources. The team tested multiple versions that could carry payloads like antenna so that they could wireless communicate with a smartphone or each other. Other sensors could monitor things like air acidity, water quality and solar radiation.&nbsp;</p><p>The flyers are still concepts right now and not ready to deploy into the atmosphere, but the team plans to expand their findings with different designs. Key to that is the use of biodegradable materials so they wouldn&#39;t persist in the environment.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We don&#39;t think about these devices... as a permanent monitoring componentry but rather temporary ones that are addressing a particular need that’s of finite time duration,&quot; Rogers said. “That&#39;s the way that we&#39;re envisioning things currently: you monitor for a month and then the devices die out, dissolve, and disappear, and maybe you have to redeploy them.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nature-inspired-robots-are-among-the-tiniest-flying-devices-yet-100825751.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">09bcb4b9-2d58-43b8-9a68-5311e97bd19f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 10:08:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632391707</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T10:08:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61c86ce0-1c4c-11ec-9dce-ae314718b4f0" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61c86ce0-1c4c-11ec-9dce-ae314718b4f0" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nature]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nature-inspired robots are among the tiniest flying devices yet]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nature-inspired robots are among the tiniest flying devices yet]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Xbox Insiders' 360 gamerpics now display properly on modern consoles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re attached to your Xbox 360 gamerpic but hate how that it looks <a href="https://twitter.com/noukon/status/1428469278068539394">small and ridiculous</a> on modern consoles, don&#39;t change it for a newer one just yet.

It will only show up if you&#39;ve ever had an Xbox 360 gamerpic, &quot;and if your current gamerpic isn&#39;t already your Xbox 360 gamerpic,&quot; she said. Once set, any changes you make on an Xbox 360 console will &quot;automatically carry over.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The fix arrived first to the Xbox Alpha Ring, but has now hit the Insider ring starting with Alpha Skip Ahead users.

As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/22/amazon-california-productivity-quotas/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> notes, that makes California the first state to put a restriction on productivity quotas in warehouses like Amazon&#39;s, and it could lead to better conditions for workers. After the law takes effect on January 1st, 2022, companies will be required to have transparency around productivity quotas. They have to disclose those quotas to their workers and provide authorities with a detailed description of the targets workers are expected to meet.</p><p>In addition, it will prohibit the use of algorithms that prevent workers from being able to take state-mandated meal and bathroom breaks or force them to do things that aren&#39;t in compliance with health and safety laws. Workers can&#39;t be fired or retaliated against for failing to meet unsafe quotas, as well. In his office&#39;s announcement, Gov. Newson said in a statement:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;We cannot allow corporations to put profit over people. The hardworking warehouse employees who have helped sustain us during these unprecedented times should not have to risk injury or face punishment as a result of exploitative quotas that violate basic health and safety. I&#39;m proud to sign this legislation giving them the dignity, respect and safety they deserve and advancing California&#39;s leadership at the forefront of workplace safety.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>The bill&#39;s proponents had Amazon in mind when they wrote it up. Amazon&#39;s warehouse workers previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-amazon-minimum-wage-15-dollars.html">spoke out</a> about having to urinate in bottles just so they wouldn&#39;t have to be disciplined for &quot;idle time.&quot; The e-commerce giant also has a massive injury rate, because workers are expected to be able to keep up with the machines they&#39;re working with.&nbsp;</p><p>California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, the bill&#39;s author, <a href="https://a80.asmdc.org/press-releases/20210922-governor-signs-gonzalez-bill-creating-nations-first-protections-against">said</a> in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;This bill is simply about giving workers some basic dignity back and empowering them to keep themselves safe. As workers are increasingly surveilled on the job and supervised by algorithms, AB 701 is just the beginning of our work to regulate dangerous quotas and keep employers that have operated above the law in check.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, however, previously denied that the company has unreasonable productivity quotas. In a <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/2020-letter-to-shareholders">letter</a> to shareholders back in April, he said that employees are &quot;are able to take informal breaks throughout their shifts&quot; and that the company doesn&#39;t set &quot;unreasonable performance goals.&quot; He added: &quot;We set achievable performance goals that take into account tenure and actual employee performance data.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-warehouse-productivity-quota-law-052141689.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02f2fefa-1d79-4dd9-8051-f245f4802db9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 05:21:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632379917</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T06:52:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1f224820-1c29-11ec-bbf5-a3747e8ba0c1" width="7552" height="5035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1f224820-1c29-11ec-bbf5-a3747e8ba0c1" width="7552" height="5035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MediaNews Group/The Riverside Press-Enterprise via Getty Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[EASTVALE, CA - AUGUST 31: Amnesty technician Gustavo Morales controls logistics robots at Amazon fulfillment center in Eastvale on Tuesday, Aug. 31, 2021.

At $799 for a single watch, you’re paying a hefty premium to get the Thom Browne model over the $250 Galaxy Watch 4 and $350 Galaxy Watch 4 Classic, but that’s how it usually goes with high fashion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-classic-thom-browne-020036074.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c44d83d5-dcd6-4f10-814a-3fa0fd9ae415</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 02:00:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632339771</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T19:42:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c076d2e0-0509-11ec-9ffe-f12b26f5f23f" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c076d2e0-0509-11ec-9ffe-f12b26f5f23f" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Thom Browne edition of the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 laying on its side with greenery in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Thom Browne edition]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Impossible's plant-based 'pork' is coming to restaurants this fall]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just a couple of weeks after bringing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/impossible-chicken-nuggets-130035016.html"><ins>“chicken” nuggets to restaurants</ins></a>, Impossible Foods is launching another plant-based product.

Chef David Chang&#39;s Momofuku Ssäm Bar in Manhattan will serve a version of its spicy rice cakes made with Impossible Pork ragu as of tomorrow. Starting on October 4th, more than 100 restaurants in Hong Kong will offer dishes using the ingredient, which will also arrive on some Singapore menus in the coming weeks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Impossible claims its faux pork is more sustainable than ground pork from pigs. The company says the product uses up to 85 percent less water and as much as 82 percent less land than is needed for typical pork production, while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 77 percent. In addition, Impossible claims the ingredient has fewer calories, less fat and more iron than 70/30 USDA ground pork.</p><p>We tried Impossible Pork <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-impossible-pork-taste-test.html"><ins>at CES 2020</ins></a> and found it tasted pretty similar to the real thing.

He&#39;ll move to a part-time position as Facebook&#39;s first Senior Fellow at some point in 2022, when he&#39;ll help foster talent and improve the development process. The move will let Schroepfer spend more time with his family and philanthropy, according to the CTO&#39;s social post.</p><p>Hardware lead <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">Andrew &quot;Boz&quot; Bosworth</a> will gradually replace Schroepfer as CTO in 2022. The departing executive made clear that his exit was voluntary — it was a &quot;difficult decision&quot; for someone still excited about Facebook&#39;s prospects, he said. Accordingly, company chief Mark Zuckerberg said Schroepfer played a &quot;critical role&quot; and was a &quot;close friend.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Schroepfer first joined Facebook in 2008 as a vice president of engineering. He took the CTO position in 2013.</p><p>Bosworth&#39;s ascension makes sense for a company increasingly focused on hardware like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">smart glasses</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">VR headsets</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-portals-go-170004952.html">Portal displays</a>. It&#39;s not without some controversy, however. The soon-to-be CTO has authored controversial internal memos in the past, including a 2016 memo seemingly justifying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-30-leaked-facebook-memo-ugly-truth.html">growth at any cost</a> and a 2020 write-up expressing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-facebook-leaked-boz-memo-trump.html">reluctance to fact-check politicians</a>. Boz later said he&#39;d changed his views in response to critiques, but he wasn&#39;t exactly known for sensitivity to privacy and misinformation issues in the past.</p><p>Whatever the new CTO&#39;s current stance might be, it won&#39;t be surprising if Facebook shifts its technology priorities. Zuckerberg added that a &quot;few other groups&quot; will join Bosworth as part of the transition, helping Facebook develop its metaverse. While the social media giant is already focusing much of its attention on virtual spaces, they might take an even higher priority under Boz.</p><div id="d9c4e8583b0b49ab82d3a0a938e103ce"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fschrep%2Fposts%2F10159715842464443&amp;show_text=true&amp;width=500" width="500" height="263" style="border:none;overflow:hidden;" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-cto-steps-down-2022-205051710.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4b934b90-4e3c-4f41-b191-ea92007d67cc</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:50:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632345394</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T21:16:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Board & Management Changes]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d1c03c60-1be5-11ec-b1b5-2c26965a1640" width="5208" height="3472" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d1c03c60-1be5-11ec-b1b5-2c26965a1640" width="5208" height="3472" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mike Schroepfer, Chief Technology Officer at Facebook speaks at the WSJTECH live conference in Laguna Beach, California, U.S. October 21, 2019.

Lavatories, apparently. As <em>ZDNet</em><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ex-microsoft-ceo-steve-ballmer-has-a-new-obsession-toilets/">notes</a>, the former Microsoft chief (and now LA Clippers owner) told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2021/09/20/steve-ballmer-clippers-intuit-arena/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> and others that he has been obsessed with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-wants-your-help-designing-future-moon-toilets-130012151.html">toilets</a> at the Clippers&#39; upcoming stadium, the Intuit Dome. And yes, Ballmer declared &quot;toilets, toilets, toilets&quot; — when he repeats a word multiple times, you know he&#39;s serious.</p><p>This doesn&#39;t mean the toilets are about to run Windows or flush water in Microsoft colors. Rather, it&#39;s that the Intuit Dome will have an NBA-leading ratio of toilets (one for every 27 seats in the upper deck). Ballmer hates waiting in line for the washroom at a sports arena, and that high ratio will make sure you spend more watching the game than doing your business.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It won&#39;t surprise you to hear the Clippers used technology to solve that problem, however. The team used a computer model to estimate how long it would take a fan to use the washroom, grab food and return to their seat. That high toilet-to-fan ratio should help you get back in the space of a typical NBA timeout. Don&#39;t  laugh too loudly about Ballmer&#39;s toilet fixation, then, as you might just appreciate it when nature calls in the middle of a playoff game.</p><div id="3ffcf3212dfb4b84bafe90ea61ee20e9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZNI2ZztMFo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/steve-ballmer-toilet-obsession-203416276.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">76d561eb-f166-4e7d-a512-c789cb840503</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 20:34:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632342858</ingested><modified>2021-09-23T04:58:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/780b4690-1bdd-11ec-b7fb-01946e5fb3d3" width="4974" height="3324" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/780b4690-1bdd-11ec-b7fb-01946e5fb3d3" width="4974" height="3324" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wally Skalij via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Los Angeles, CA.

Uber Eats has introduced searchable pickup maps that lets you find restaurants by typing not only text, but emoji — a single hamburger or sushi roll could be all you need to locate an eatery.

The addition is well-timed — now that the pandemic is (slowly) easing up, you may be more inclined to pick up your food than wait for a courier.

The presentation saw the company introduce new versions of mainstay devices like the Surface Pro and Surface Go, in addition to a handful of surprises. Here’s everything Microsoft showed off on Wednesday.</p><h2></h2><h2>Surface Duo 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ddbe05f0-1bc8-11ec-b5ff-1dac4d669bed" alt="Microsoft Surface Duo 2" data-uuid="8f9f2fa2-bc60-33bb-ab26-3faf09c1bd41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Microsoft announced a massive upgrade for its Surface Duo dual-screen Android device. Most notably, there’s an entirely new triple camera system on the back of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-hands-on-price-specs-buggy-update-triple-camera-160008199.html">Surface Duo 2</a> that includes a telephoto lens and two wide-angle lenses. Another nifty new feature is an ambient screen on the device’s hinge to display your notifications and other information. With those upgrades, you can see Microsoft has started thinking of the $1,499.99 Surface Duo 2 as a more of a smartphone than a mere tablet. You can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-microsoft-surface-duo-2-surface-pro-8-surface-laptop-studio-surface-pro-x-surface-go-3-161010924.html">pre-order the Surface Duo 2 today</a> before it becomes officially available on October 21st.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Surface Pro 8</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b819d580-1bc9-11ec-a75f-a4f120ff3afe" alt="Microsoft Surface Pro 8" data-uuid="f2150be9-ef85-31dc-a0ca-97d4b705a210"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>After several years of what felt like incremental updates, Microsoft’s Surface Pro line got a significant upgrade on Wednesday. To name just a few of the features found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-8-13-inch-screen-dolby-vision-150951070.html">Surface Pro 8</a>, it includes a 13-inch PixelSense display with a 120Hz refresh rate, support for Thunderbolt 4 (finally!) and faster internals courtesy of Intel’s latest 11th-generation processors. Oh, and Microsoft has also shaved down the Surface Pro’s notoriously chunky display bezels. The Surface Pro 8 will start at $1,100 and is available to pre-order today. It goes on sale on October 5th. That’s the same day <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-release-date-132605467.html">Windows 11</a> starts rolling out.</p><p>Alongside the Surface Pro 8, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-151216222.html">Slim Pen 2</a>. The $130 stylus includes a haptic motor Microsoft claims makes it feel like you’re putting pen to paper rather than glass. Another new accessory, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-adaptive-kit-accessibility-160002034.html">Surface Adaptive Kit</a>, bundles together a collection of add-ons that make it easier to find specific keys, locate ports and open your laptop or its kickstand. Lastly, the company made a mouse made from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-ocean-plastic-mouse-recycled-materials-160014611.html">recycled ocean plastic</a>.</p><h2>Surface Pro X</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dec2c230-1bbc-11ec-b3f7-ef955f95edd0" alt="Surface Pro X" data-uuid="f64aefb0-75d2-33f3-b35a-fb98b08eba45"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Microsoft didn’t update its ARM-based 2-in-1, but what it did do is introduce a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-pro-x-wifi-only-899-usd-151558748.html">new WiFi-only</a> model that will save you $100 off the Surface Pro X’s previous $999 starting price. With the move to Windows 11, support for 64-bit software emulation is coming to the device. You can pre-order the new model today before it arrives in stores on October 5th.</p><h2>Surface Go 3</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/60495d80-1bc9-11ec-bff1-96d97cba35b2" alt="Surface Go 3" data-uuid="dae841a3-bcaa-3fe4-b8db-fe3a6acc77dd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Microsoft’s smallest tablet got an appropriately minor update today. The company’s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-go-3-release-date-specs-151539602.html">Surface Go 3</a> 2-in-1s feature faster processors from Intel. The base model comes with a Pentium Gold 6500Y CPU, up from the 4425Y in Go 2, while the more expensive variants feature 10th-generation Core i3 CPUs. Microsoft claims the latter chip is 60 percent faster than the Core m3 it previously offered with the Go 2. The entire Surface Go 3 family is available to pre-order today, with the base model starting at $400. Like all the other Surface computers Microsoft announced today, it goes on sale on October 5th.</p><h2>Surface Laptop Studio</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/12962910-1bc9-11ec-bb7a-0e64499fea18" alt="Surface Laptop Studio" data-uuid="ec688478-0043-30cf-a690-7ee84b64dedc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Microsoft<strong>&nbsp;</strong>saved its most interesting announcement for last. Enter the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-laptop-studio-easel-hinge-153618416.html">Surface Laptop Studio</a>, a portable computer that borrows design cues from the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-21-surface-studio-2-review.html">Surface Studio all-in-one</a>. An included hinge lets you pull the display over the keyboard to make inking and drawing more immersive. Microsoft also claims the Surface Studio is its most powerful notebook yet. The laptop features Intel’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-11th-gen-h-series-cpus-ultraportable-gaming-213018614.html">11th-generation H35 processors</a> and Intel Xe graphics. You can also configure it with NVIDIA’s RTX 3050 Ti GPU. The Surface Laptop Studio is available to pre-order today. It starts at $1,600 and will ship on October 5th.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from </em>Microsoft&#39;s<em> fall Surface event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/surface%202021"><em>right here</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-2021-event-recap-185020522.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf0d4c7d-f364-4fd5-bdc1-fde00ead2b4c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 18:50:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632336268</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T18:44:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/da199890-1bd4-11ec-bfb7-cbe69cc8250d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/da199890-1bd4-11ec-bfb7-cbe69cc8250d" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[In-person TwitchCon events will return in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s still too early to tell what the COVID-19 situation will be like next summer, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitch"><ins>Twitch</ins></a> is hopeful it can bring streamers and fans back together in person in 2022.

Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1440711772483186690">shared communications</a> between the two sides, in which Apple said it won&#39;t consider reinstating Epic&#39;s developer program account &quot;until the district court&#39;s judgment becomes final and nonappealable.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-removes-fortnite-190920925.html">yanked</a><em>Fortnite </em>from the iOS App Store in August last year after Epic added an alternative payment method to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-fortnite-direct-payment-discounts-143422257.html"><ins>bypass the 30 percent cut</ins></a> that Apple takes from in-app purchases.

Sweeney told Schiller that bringing the game back to iPhone and iPad &quot;depends on whether and where Apple updates its guidelines to provide for a level playing field between Apple in-app purchase and other methods of payment. Epic will resubmit <em>Fortnite</em> to the App Store if you adhere to the plain language of the court order and allow apps to include buttons and external links that direct customers to other purchasing mechanisms without onerous terms or impediments to a good user experience.&quot;</p><p>However, as Apple&#39;s lawyers wrote in a letter to Epic on Monday, the court affirmed &quot;Apple&#39;s termination of the [Developer Program License Agreement] and the related agreements between Epic Games and Apple was valid, lawful and enforceable&quot; following a breach of contract by Epic. Apple noted Sweeney said after the ruling that his company wouldn&#39;t give up an alternative payment system &quot;to get <em>Fortnite</em> back on iOS.&quot;</p><p>Following that comment and &quot;other statements since the court&#39;s decision, couple with Epic&#39;s duplicitous conduct in the past, Apple has exercised its discretion not to reinstate Epic&#39;s developer program account at this time,&quot; the letter states.&nbsp;</p><p>In short, unless you stream the game to your iPhone from your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-remote-play-ios-230628909.html">Xbox</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-ssd-storage-expansion-firmware-update-ps4-remote-play-135032853.html">PlayStation</a>, don&#39;t expect to build <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEaRI2Bjr-U">armored walls</a> in <em>Fortnite </em>on iOS any time in the near future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-court-appeals-epic-games-175240669.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7aa984c3-8b43-4fc4-903d-d4f84d6db5b1</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 17:52:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632333163</ingested><modified>2021-09-22T17:52:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/ef28fc90-e23b-11ea-bd47-f9bfabb5acb6" width="7548" height="5032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/ef28fc90-e23b-11ea-bd47-f9bfabb5acb6" width="7548" height="5032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CHRIS DELMAS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[This illustration picture shows Epic Games' Fortnite loading on a smartphone in Los Angeles on August 14, 2020. - Apple and Google on August 13, 2020 pulled video game sensation Fortnite from their mobile app shops after its maker Epic Games released an update that dodges revenue sharing with the tech giants.
