Per <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/h-r-block-sues-block-formerly-square-for-trademark-infringement-11639658529?mod=djemalertNEWS"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, H&amp;R Block is suing the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-rebranding-block-224240493.html">formerly known as Square</a>. In a federal complaint filed on Thursday, the tax-prep firm said the name change could hurt its brand. It wants Jack Dorsey’s payments outfit to stop using the name and a logo it contends is “nearly identical” to its own.</p><p>“The goodwill that Block has so carefully created and nurtured over the past six decades is now under attack by a Silicon Valley fintech company,” it said. We’ve reached out to Block, the other one, for comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Square changed its name to Block at the start of December. At the time, the company said it wanted a name that better reflected the expansion of its business beyond payments and the growing importance of blockchain technologies to its identity. Since its founding in 2009, Block’s business has expanded to include stock and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-25-square-free-stock-trades-cash-app.html"><ins>crypto trading</ins></a>, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/banking/loans"><ins>money lending</ins></a> and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-buys-control-of-tidal-142318706.html"><ins>music streaming</ins></a>.</p><p>Where things may get tricky in terms of a trademark infringement complaint is that Block <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en/press/credit-karma-tax">bought Credit Karma&#39;s tax-prep business</a> in 2020. It plans to offer tax returns through its Cash App. In trademark cases, a court will look at similarities between the products and services two companies offer. It will also consider how the two may compete against one another in the future. Jack, if you&#39;re reading this: it&#39;s never been a better time to rebrand the company to &quot;Tesseract.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/h-and-r-block-sues-block-193019198.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">182ac5c9-5fad-4952-a9e3-b6cf0311a3a4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 19:30:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639682443</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T19:20:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-07/88459e50-a22e-11e9-a7fe-b33d7c5c6f79" width="5502" height="3668" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/88459e50-a22e-11e9-a7fe-b33d7c5c6f79" width="5502" height="3668" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucas Jackson / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jack Dorsey, CEO of Square and CEO of Twitter, uses his phone to live cast during an event outside of the New York Stock Exchange to celebrate the IPO of Square Inc., in New York November 19, 2015.

This week, the automaker unveiled the <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3467">Mobile Eccentric Droid</a> or MobED, a new mobility platform for taking on even the trickiest surfaces and uneven ground.</p><div id="a8a360297fd540b9a29dffbb2bb1994a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzV-GI7n1GI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company’s Robotics Lab says it developed MobED to overcome the limitations of existing indoor and service robots. Each of the robot’s wheels features independent power and steering control systems that allow it to rotate in place and move in any direction. It also has an eccentric drive system, hence the name, that allows it to independently adjust the height of each of its wheels. As you can see from the video, that means it can provide a stable platform for something as delicate as glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>MobED can expand its wheelbase up to about 25 inches when it needs as much stability as possible. It can also contract to about 17 inches when it finds itself in more complex environments. All told, the platform is approximately 26 inches long, 23 inches wide and 13 inches tall. A 2 kWh battery allows the robot to drive for approximately four hours on a single charge.</p><p>Outside of working as a service robot, Hyundai envisions MobED helping out in places like the movie industry where film crews could mount their equipment to the platform. It could also be used for deliveries and other purposes where stability is essential. We’ll get a chance to see more of the robot when Hyundai demos it at CES 2022 next month. However, the company hasn&#39;t said if it plans to commercialize MobED.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-mobed-annoucement-180932482.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa53711f-324a-4d05-9145-99e26d02ad19</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 18:09:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639678176</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T18:09:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a8b6080-5e99-11ec-bf34-61814849afbc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a8b6080-5e99-11ec-bf34-61814849afbc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hyundai]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MobED]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MobED]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok is testing a desktop livestreaming app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a> is getting into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-livestream-mute-temporary-harassment-184929315.html">livestreaming</a> from desktops.

Only &quot;minimum service&quot; offerings will remain untouched. Everything else is going up. Some increases are modest, such as for Optimo Mas and Choice ($4 and $5 respectively), but grandfathered users subscribed to tiers like Ultimate or Premier will pay $10 more per month.</p><p>The move raises the base pricing of DirecTV&#39;s Stream Choice to $90 per month, while Premier will cost $150 per month. Satellite customers won&#39;t be immune to increases, either. Outside of minimum service and ChineseDirect Plus, you&#39;ll see increases on January 23rd between $1 (for most Basic and Family plans) to $10 (for Max and Plus). And while some regional sports fees are dropping in price, there&#39;s now a fifth, $12 per month tier on top of the previous $10 maximum. You may see a price drop or increase depending on your ZIP code.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The firm wasn&#39;t shy about its reasoning. While hikes like these are frequently pinned on steeper programming costs, DirecTV said &quot;higher-than normal inflation&quot; from suppliers was also to blame.

So, preventing that from happening is important.</p><p>&quot;Our goal is for each person&#39;s For You feed to feature a breadth of content, creators, and topics,&quot; TikTok said, noting that too many similar videos appearing in the feed doesn&#39;t reflect the kind of experience it wants to foster.

Pixelmator has <a href="https://www.pixelmator.com/photo/">released</a> a version of Photo for the iPhone that brings the advanced image editor to smaller screens. Much like the tablet app and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-23-pixelmator-pro-update-integration-apple-photos.html">Pixelmator Pro</a>, you can make a wide range of non-destructive edits to photos either from the phone (including ProRAW from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">some iPhones</a>) or from 600-plus RAW formats from dedicated cameras.</p><p>You&#39;ll most likely be using some of the 30-plus color adjustments, including basics like exposure and white balance through to a wheel-based color balance system like you&#39;d find for video grading. However, Pixelmator Photo also makes use of some helpful (if <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">increasingly familiar</a>) AI editing features, including object removal and upscaling for low-resolution shots. You can also expect fairly tight integration with Apple&#39;s Photos and iCloud, such as saving edits to (or opening images from) your library.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pixelmator Photo normally sells for $8, but it&#39;s available for $4 to help spur iPhone buyers. The app is a free update for those already using the iPad version. This probably won&#39;t tear you away from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-10-adobe-lightrooms-direct-import-feature-comes-to-iphone-and-ipad.html">Adobe Lightroom</a> and other pro photo editing apps, but Pixelmator&#39;s classic strategy might still apply here. It&#39;s offering an affordable, pay-once alternative to Lightroom&#39;s Premium membership and other subscriptions you frequently need for this level of editing.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pixelmator-photo-iphone-app-150045119.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5daf5247-71b2-4035-b487-32e50977b680</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 15:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639590318</ingested><modified>2021-12-15T17:45:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/42708c30-5dc7-11ec-9ffd-7533a9742062" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/42708c30-5dc7-11ec-9ffd-7533a9742062" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pixelmator Team]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pixelmator Photo image editor for iPhone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Pixelmator Photo image editor for iPhone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify adds listener ratings for podcasts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-05-spotify-podcasts-the-ringer.html">years-long podcast push</a>, Spotify has been constantly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-home-screen-updates-history-recently-played-151354355.html">adding new features for users</a> on top of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-bad-robot-audio-jj-abrams-podcasts-182214760.html">steadily expanding</a> its library of 3.2 million shows.

The star rating system will be familiar to podcast listeners as platforms like <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-podcasts/">Apple Podcasts</a> also use the scoring metric. Like Apple, Spotify will display the number of ratings in parenthesis beside the average score on each show&#39;s page.

With many final pre-Christmas paychecks slated to arrive this week, there&#39;s a concern some employees might not get paid in a timely fashion when they need it most.</p><p>Kronos reported the attack on December 11th, but it wasn&#39;t until December 13th the company warned it might take &quot;several weeks&quot; to fully restore functionality. The company didn&#39;t identify the perpetrators. It also couldn&#39;t completely rule out a connection to the recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/log4shell-vulnerability-log4j-155543990.html">Log4j vulnerability</a>, but went through &quot;rapid patching&quot; and supply chain checks to make sure its systems weren&#39;t susceptible.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not clear how soon hours and payroll functionality might come back. In the meantime, though, companies have had to scramble to find alternatives. Whole Foods told <em>NBC</em> it had found a way to pay staff this week, but Honda only said it was &quot;taking steps&quot; to mitigate any problems. One anonymous Whole Foods worker said teammates had been asked to rely on paper punch sheets and handwritten schedules.</p><p>The Kronos incident illustrates the sheer breadth of ransomware victims in recent months, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ransomware-jbs-payment-032554207.html">meat supplier</a> and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doj-bitcoin-colonial-pipeline-214036814.html">key oil pipeline operator</a>. It also underscores the fragility of modern workplace technology.

It does so by using old code from the 1990s used to process text in scanner images.</p><p>Once inside a device, the malware can set up its own virtualized environment and run javascript-like code, with no need to connect to an outside server.

While the model is currently in stock, make sure to check your estimated delivery dates before you decide to buy it as a Christmas gift, because it may arrive after the holidays even if you purchase it right now.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ywCWyO" id="8a99d255e35b4d708e2b5f3c404a8700" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy New Apple AirPods (3rd Generation) at Amazon - $140</a><p>If you don&#39;t mind the possibility that your order might arrive after the holidays and have been looking to buy a pair of AirPods in the first place, the third-gen model is a great buy. While it still doesn&#39;t come with the Pro&#39;s silicone buds, it represents a complete redesign for the product line. In our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">review</a>, where we gave it a score of 88, we found it more comfortable than its predecessors due to its new &quot;contoured design.&quot; It&#39;s shorter than previous models and can direct sounds better into your ear, leading to massive improvements to its audio quality.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple also paired a custom driver with a high-dynamic-range amplifier to produce &quot;rich consistent bass&quot; and &quot;crisp, clean&quot; sounds that improve audio quality even further, making it more immersive than before. And, thanks to the H1 chip, the third-gen AirPods feature Adaptive EQ, spatial audio, one-touch fast pairing and always-on Siri. Finally, we praised the model for its battery life: The earbuds themselves can last for six hours, and the case can extend your listening time for up to 30 hours total.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

The <a href="https://www.media.stellantis.com/em-en/citroen/press/ready-for-adventure-citroen-my-ami-buggy-concept-embodies-ami-s-vision-of-leisure?adobe_mc_ref=">My Ami Buggy</a> is based on the Ami we all <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hands-on-citroen-ami-ev-133032057.html">know and love</a>, but adds some practical and stylistic touches like wider knobby tires, an LED light bar and removable canvas doors.&nbsp;</p><p>The buggy is mainly a way for Citroën&#39;s designers to show off their chops by adding &quot;stylish attributes to assert its intrepid and friendly backpacker personality,&quot; according to the company. As such, they drew inspiration from things like construction games, industrial design and fashion.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="29ec319dae494199a7609f7eb684cae4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MuXIh2dTA8k?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>To be sure, it looks like your ten-year-old&#39;s idea of a buggy, assuming the kid had some design talent. The khaki, black and yellow color scheme is the first attention-grabbing feature, giving it an outdoorsy camouflage feel and yet high visibility.</p><p>Another key feature is the doors, or lack thereof. The regular ones have been replaced by removable canvas doors with zippers, bringing some much-needed air circulation and buggy allure. The knobbier and wider tires will let you take it onto rougher roads, as long as you remember that ground clearance isn&#39;t amazing. It also has headlight protectors and a spare knobby tire mounted on the roof that add a &quot;spirit of adventure&quot; and ratchet up the cuteness factor.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/16d0b580-5e64-11ec-afbb-a3e6e165a820" alt="Citro&#xeb;n has transformed its tiny Ami EV into an adorable buggy concept" data-uuid="95246f38-969d-35ff-8bd8-57080f710d89"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Copyright maison-vignaux @ Continental Productions</div></figure><p>Other additions include an LED lightbar, removable &quot;nomadic speaker,&quot; a roof cap to protect against the sun and a graphics package that includes the words &quot;Pilot&quot; and &quot;01&quot; on the driver&#39;s seat and &quot;Copilot&quot; and &quot;02&quot; on the passenger seat. It also offers thicker memory foam in the seats, new storage bins on the dashboard and even a range of luggage designed to &quot;fit perfectly into the vehicle&#39;s interior spaces,&quot; according to Citroën. Other features like  smartphone clamps, bottle holders and more were all built using 3D printing so that they can be reproduced on demand.&nbsp;</p><p>As a reminder, the Ami can hit a top speed of 28 MPH and go 44 miles on its 5.5 kWh battery. It&#39;s also legal for teenagers 14 and older to drive in France and elsewhere in Europe. The company&#39;s designers must have had a lot of fun with the My Ami Buggy concept, but there&#39;s no word yet on whether Citroën will ever build and sell it — though the kid in all of us certainly hopes so.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/citroen-has-transformed-its-ami-ev-into-an-adorable-buggy-concept-123517763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">73b2cac1-ff3c-4cf2-96eb-8965d994e282</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 12:35:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639660343</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T13:12:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/10f6e1a0-5e5c-11ec-bffa-ca2d017112ab" width="1170" height="740" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/10f6e1a0-5e5c-11ec-bffa-ca2d017112ab" width="1170" height="740" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Citroen]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Citroen has transformed its tiny Ami EV into an adorable buggy concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Citroen has transformed its tiny Ami EV into an adorable buggy concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Oppo's take on folding smartphones doesn't look so huge]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Still not sold on foldable smartphones?

In his newest post, he said Square Enix is now giving those players an additional 14 days.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to halting <em>FFXIV</em> sales, the company will prioritize the logins of people with an active subscription going forward.

The move comes shortly after the same publication <a href="https://sea.ign.com/destiny/179904/news/the-battle-for-bungies-soul-inside-the-studios-struggle-for-a-better-work-culture">released</a> a report with accounts by former and current Bungie employees painting a picture of a workplace culture that&#39;s both toxic and sexist. In some instances, HR personnel were reportedly unwilling to help complainants and actively protected harmful individuals.</p><p>In her email sent to employees and seen by <em>IGN</em>, d&#39;Hondt said she wants to do &quot;everything in [her] power to make sure everyone who works [at Bungie] has a safe, welcoming, and supportive environment.&quot; It&#39;s necessary, she added, for the company&#39;s HR team to move forward with membership &quot;largely comprised of people new to Bungie.&quot; d&#39;Hondt didn&#39;t say who would be replacing her, but she told employees in the email that the HR team needs &quot;to be trusted to be [their] advocates — not labeled as &#39;enablers&#39; or seen as company resources who provide bad actors with safe harbor.&quot; It&#39;s also unclear if d&#39;Hondt is leaving the video game developer completely or just moving to a different role.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The former HR head mentioned about her own experience with an abuser at the company, as well: A male executive whom she thought was her friend. While she didn&#39;t name her abuser, she said Bungie eventually fired him. She concluded:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;I am proud of the work I did at this company. I believe I made recommendations that were in the best interest of our people and in service of the company we wish to become. I also believe we made some mistakes, and that to become the better version of ourselves — the company I know we can be – we have to acknowledge and confront them, in good faith, and grow together.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While <em>IGN&#39;s</em> report showed the company in a less-than-flattering light, it also showed how the studio is struggling to shake its toxic culture in an effort to foster a better one. In response to it, company CEO Pete Parsons <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-responds-ign-report-211235404.html">published</a> an apology letter, admitting that Bungie&#39;s &quot;actions or, in some cases, inactions, caused these people pain.&quot; He also talked about the changes the company has made over the past few years to make it a better place for employees, including removing bad actors irrespective of their &quot;tenure, seniority or interpersonal relationships.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bungie-head-of-hr-steps-down-103523997.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0fc4e1d3-c403-497b-bbf4-0389865a29a7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 10:35:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639652434</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T11:00:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1bf9bc80-5e57-11ec-a737-f7b93997d5d5" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1bf9bc80-5e57-11ec-a737-f7b93997d5d5" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chesnot via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 31:  Gamers play the video game 'Destiny 2' developed by Bungie Studios and published by Activision during the 'Paris Games Week' on October 31, 2017 in Paris, France.
