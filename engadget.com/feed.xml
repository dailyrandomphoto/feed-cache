Elon Musk has <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1411172276188319745">revealed</a> that Tesla is adding rear-wheel steering to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-22-tesla-cybertruck-impressions-ride.html">Cybertruck</a> to help the EV maneuver with &quot;high agility.&quot; It&#39;s a rough answer to the Hummer&#39;s &quot;Crab Mode&quot; and R1T&#39;s tank turns, in other words. You might not have much trouble with a tight U-turn or tricky off-road scenario.</p><p>Musk also reiterated that the Cybertruck&#39;s design will be &quot;almost exactly&quot; what you saw at the introduction in November 2019, although he teased that there were many &quot;other great things&quot; in the pipeline. The pickup is still due to enter production in late 2021.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rear-wheel steering may be virtually necessary. The Cybertruck is large even by truck standards — it might be a tough sell if it&#39;s difficult to steer out of a parking lot. Moreover, rivals like GMC, Rivian <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-electric-truck-013038952.html">and Ford</a> are all launching electric trucks that might match or sometimes beat Tesla&#39;s feature set.

The <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a8e7c9a2-5819-424f-b087-c6f2e8f0c7a1"><em>Financial Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/technology-provider-kaseya-warns-of-cyberattack-11625266350?mod=rss_Technology"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> report that IT management software giant Kaseya has <a href="https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4403440684689">fallen victim</a> to a ransomware attack that compromised its VSA remote maintenance tool. The company initially claimed that &quot;fewer than 40&quot; of its customers were directly affected, but security response firm Huntress said three managed service providers it worked with had also succumbed to the attack and compromising over 200 companies.</p><p>The number could be higher. Huntress noted there were eight affected cloud service providers, potentially affecting many more firms. Swedish supermarket chain Coop <a href="https://therecord.media/supermarket-chain-coop-closes-800-stores-following-kaseya-ransomware-attack/">closed</a> almost 800 stores after one of its contractors became a target.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Kaseya said it had identified the likely source of the security flaw and was developing a patch that would be &quot;tested thoroughly.&quot; In the meantime, though, the company urged all customers to shut down their VSA servers and keep them offline until they could install the update. Software-as-a-service customers were &quot;never at-risk,&quot; Kaseya added, although the company took down that functionality as a precaution.</p><p>It&#39;s not certain who&#39;s behind the attack, although Huntress <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/msp/comments/ocggbv/crticial_ransomware_incident_in_progress/">tied the campaign</a> to the Russia-linked REvil group that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jbs-ransomware-attack-revil-fbi-121508042.html">attacked beef supplier JBS</a>.</p><p>The incident is the latest in a string of high-profile ransomware attacks, including JBS and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/colonial-pipeline-restarts-operations-060635370.html">Colonial Pipeline</a>. It also follows the large-scale <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-customer-support-compromised-solarwinds-hackers-033613290.html">SolarWinds breaches</a> attributed to another group, Nobelium. Online security is quickly becoming a major issue in the supply chain, and it&#39;s not clear these problems will disappear any time soon.</p><p>Kaseya&#39;s breach also reflects the dangers of relying heavily on one company&#39;s software platform. While the number of directly affected clients is small, the supply chain network appears to have created a ripple effect that damaged numerous companies down the line. The situation might not improve until there&#39;s either tighter security among Kaseya-like providers or more competition that reduces the potential damage.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kaseya-ransomware-cyberattack-155719139.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2d5a7562-7099-4978-b423-0e41fc990409</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 15:57:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625328605</ingested><modified>2021-07-03T16:10:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business Services & Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/68aad870-8811-11ea-aaf9-cf125617cab2" width="4063" height="2674" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/68aad870-8811-11ea-aaf9-cf125617cab2" width="4063" height="2674" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tero Vesalainen via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Man installing software in laptop in dark at night.

The two brands have come to the decision to &quot;best leverage [their] shared resources&quot; and to standardize the software experience across their portfolio. But what does OnePlus mean exactly when it said that they&#39;re &quot;working on integrating the codebase of OxygenOS and ColorOS?&quot; It said you may not even notice a difference, because the changes are happening behind the scenes.</p><p>OxygenOS will still be the operating system for OnePlus devices released globally. As <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/02/oneplus-android-update-schedule-years-oxygenos-coloros/"><em>9to5Google</em></a> notes, OnePlus phones released in China already run ColorOS, and that will likely remain the case — it&#39;s just that the operating systems will now shade a codebase. All new devices the sub-brand will release will run the new OxygenOS, while current devices that are still receiving updates will get the new platform via an over-the-air update.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Speaking of updates, OnePlus is promising better and longer Android update support, which now rivals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-android-update-support-164719712.html">Samsung&#39;s</a>, with the change. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/one-plus-8-pro-review-5g-120-hz-quad-camera-155534134.html">OnePlus 8 series</a> and the brand&#39;s newer flagships will receive three major Android updates and four years of security updates going forward. Meanwhile, the first Nord and any newer Nord and Nord CE devices will receive two major Android and three years of security updates. Finally, the affordable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-143031687.html">Nord N series</a> phones starting from the N10 and the N100 will get one major Android update and three years of security updates. Unfortunately, you can continue expecting two major Android and three years of security updates if you have a flagship older than the OnePlus 8.</p><p>When the merge was announced, the companies said OnePlus will remain independently operated. Since the move was meant to pool their resources and to better streamline their operations, though, linking their operating systems more closely doesn&#39;t come as surprise.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-oppo-oxygenos-coloros-shared-codebase-141211007.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9e6facc-9b34-4c01-85e6-6c2a0b11e26f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 14:12:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625321540</ingested><modified>2021-07-03T14:12:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6f857a10-dbee-11eb-a763-584a15051ee3" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6f857a10-dbee-11eb-a763-584a15051ee3" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OnePlus]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OnePlus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cop tried to use a Taylor Swift song to keep protestor video off YouTube]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems more and more law enforcement agents are trying to use online platforms&#39; copyright-takedown measures to prevent videos that show them in a bad light <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beverly-hills-police-instagram-copyright-232013882.html">from being shared</a> online.

Ray Kelly told <em>The Post</em> that there&#39;s no policy barring what the officer did in the video, but that the office does not &quot;condone&quot; his behavior.</p><p>Back in February, several police officers in Beverly Hills had also been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beverly-hills-police-instagram-copyright-232013882.html">caught on video</a> seemingly trying to get a prominent LA activist banned from Instagram by triggering is copyright filters.

Following the two flaws hackers exploited to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/western-digital-my-book-live-factory-reset-two-vulnerabilities-044122712.html">wipe My Book Live devices remotely</a>, security journalist Brian Krebs has <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/">published a report</a> on another zero-day vulnerability that affects Western Digital products running the company’s My Cloud OS3 software. What’s more, it doesn’t appear there will be an official fix for those who don’t upgrade to a newer storage solution.</p><div id="bc7af78bcb1b42359c3c5b93c1626ec7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vsg9YgvGBec?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Earlier in the year, security researchers Radek Domanski and Pedro Ribeiro discovered a series of weaknesses that allow a malicious actor to remotely update a My Cloud OS3 device to add a backdoor. The two say they never heard back from the company when they tried to contact it about the vulnerability. Western Digital attributes its response (or lack thereof) to one of its previous policies.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The communication that came our way confirmed the research team involved planned to release details of the vulnerability and asked us to contact them with any questions,” a spokesperson for the company told Krebs. “We didn’t have any questions so we didn’t respond. Since then, we have updated our process and respond to every report in order to avoid any miscommunication like this again.”</p><p>While the flaw isn’t present in Western Digital&#39;s new My Cloud OS 5, it’s unclear if the company ever went back to address it in My Cloud OS3. What’s more, it no longer plans to support the older software. “We will not provide any further security updates to the My Cloud OS3 firmware,” Western Digital says in a <a href="https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-21004-recommended-upgrade-to-mycloud-os-5">support page</a> dated to March 12th, 2021. “We strongly encourage moving to the My Cloud OS 5 firmware. If your device is not eligible for upgrade to My Cloud OS 5, we recommend that you upgrade to one of our other My Cloud offerings that support My Cloud OS 5.”</p><p>When Engadget reached out to Western Digital, a spokesperson for the company told us &quot;there is a fix for this vulnerability — we &#39;patched&#39; OS3 with OS 5.&quot; They added: &quot;My Cloud OS 5 is a major security release that provides an architectural revamp of our older My Cloud firmware. All My Cloud products currently under active support are eligible for the My Cloud OS 5 upgrade and we recommend that all users upgrade as soon as possible to benefit from the latest security fixes.&quot;</p><p>If you own a device that you can&#39;t update to My Cloud OS 5, you can <a href="https://github.com/pedrib/PoC/blob/master/advisories/Pwn2Own/Tokyo_2020/weekend_destroyer/weekend_destroyer_patch.sh">download a patch</a> Domanski and Ribiro developed. One thing to note is you’ll need to reapply it each time you reboot your device. You can also protect your My Cloud NAS drive by limiting its access to the internet.</p><p><strong>Update 6:35PM ET</strong>: Added comment from Western Digital.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/western-digital-my-cloud-os-3-vulnerability-212839292.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d2955d51-072f-4475-a356-a7da87f0b971</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 21:28:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625266629</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T22:57:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/114eebd0-db7a-11eb-b77f-541414f7e80e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/114eebd0-db7a-11eb-b77f-541414f7e80e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Western Digital]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Western Digital My Cloud]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Western Digital My Cloud]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bird pilots electric wheelchair and mobility scooter rentals in New York City]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While Bird is best known for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bird-three-172619972.html"><ins>electric scooters</ins></a>, it recently expanded into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bird-e-bike-bikesharing-120007080.html"><ins>bikeshare market</ins></a> and is now also moving into the accessibility space.

Ever since the well-designed and overly powerful 2018 iPad Pro arrived, people have increasingly asked Apple to make its tablet software as flexible and impressive as its hardware. This year’s iPadOS update isn’t going to satisfy those who want the iPad to work more like a Mac — it still feels like an iPad, for better or worse.</p><p>That said, Apple has made a handful of significant changes and a host of smaller ones, all of which add up to an experience that makes the iPad more customizable and flexible than before while still retaining (and improving upon) the basic iPad experience. There are a lot of new features to unpack, and the just-released iPadOS 15 public beta is still a work in progress, but here are some of the most significant changes to look forward to when the final software arrives this fall.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Should you install iPadOS 15?</h2><h2></h2><p>But first, a note about that beta status. Apple’s public betas are generally pretty reliable, and that’s true here, too. I’ve generally been able to use my 11-inch iPad Pro without any issues, but apps occasionally crash and throw me to the Home Screen; interacting with notifications doesn’t always work; and there are various other hiccups here and there. (Examples: my cursor doesn’t always move to the search field when I summon it, and the last few letters of my messages are sometimes cut off when using the app in Slide Over.) It’s nothing deal-breaking, but it’s noticeable, particularly when I use my iPad for multiple hours at a time. Unless you&#39;re extremely curious, I&#39;d wait for a few more beta versions to be released before giving it a shot, unless you can put it on a back-up iPad.</p><h2>Widgets and Home Screen updates</h2><h2></h2><p>With that out of the way, let’s dig into the new features. The most obvious change in iPadOS 15 is that widgets have come to the Home Screen. As with last year’s iOS 14, iPad users can now pin widgets anywhere they want. You can also select which apps you want to show on the Home Screen and stash the rest in the App Library, an auto-organized place to find everything you’ve installed on your iPad. Both widgets and the App Library came to the iPhone last year, and it was surprising that they didn’t arrive on the iPad until now.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3cab510-db63-11eb-bdf3-6f39a88d7f48" style="height:1397;width:2000;" alt="iPadOS 15" data-uuid="20466494-d72b-32fa-acf1-8215f4dcbdb0"><figcaption>My &quot;work&quot; home screen.</figcaption></figure><p>I’m glad Apple did this, because it makes your iPad’s home screens far more customizable than before, something sorely needed on a big-screen device. It took a little work, but I’ve now hidden the apps I don’t use as much in the App Library and now have five home screens curated for work, entertainment, games and so forth. For example, my work screen only has six app shortcuts (Drive, Docs, Sheet, Trello, Slack and LastPass), but the variety of widgets I have installed provides glanceable info and easy access to a lot of tools. I have a widget showing recent notes in the “work” folder, another with Reminders (also specifically from my work group), an Apple News widget showing the latest tech news, and widgets for Google Calendar and Gmail. All that, plus the apps in my dock, make this the prime place to go when I need to get things done.</p><h2>Quick Notes</h2><h2></h2><p>The other new feature that could fundamentally change the iPad experience is Quick Notes. As Apple’s Craig Federighi said during last month&#39;s WWDC keynote, Notes are now a “system-wide” feature. Swiping in from the lower right corner summons a new note that floats above whatever apps you’re using. You can quickly type or write down (with the Apple Pencil) whatever comes to mind and then swipe the note away when you’re done. Depending on your settings, you can start a new note every time you access Quick Notes, or just keep adding to the same one. Finally, you can swipe between Quick Notes you’ve started if you want to get to a specific document.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0f51a1c0-db65-11eb-bda3-ff9dd872800f" style="height:1397;width:2000;" alt="iPadOS 15 Quick Notes" data-uuid="a671b167-3284-3130-91da-940de16944ad"><figcaption>At the top of this Quick Note is a button that automatically appears to let you save a link to the page you&#39;re visiting.</figcaption></figure><p>The iPad’s Slide Over multitasking feature offered an approximation of this experience, but Quick Notes is far more flexible. For starters, you can move a Quick Note anywhere on the screen you want, making it feel like a true “window” reminiscent of something you would use on Windows or macOS. If you’re going to jump in and out of the same note frequently, you can dismiss it to the side of the iPad screen where a little arrow shows that you can summon it back quickly.</p><p>Apple’s Quick Note demos mostly focused on using the Apple Pencil to quickly jot things down, but it works just as well with a keyboard. When I’m doing work, it’s almost always with the Magic Keyboard attached, and being able to quickly summon a persistent document to take notes in, regardless of what else I was doing, makes the iPad feel significantly more versatile. It’s a great tool when doing research, especially since you can add links to web pages in Safari or destinations in Maps with one tap. My only real complaint is that the “swipe in from the bottom right” gesture is a little awkward, especially when using the iPad docked to a keyboard. It’s much with the Apple Pencil.</p><h2>Multitasking</h2><h2></h2><p>Multitasking was a major focus at WWDC, as well. While Apple did make some useful changes here, the fundamental iPad multitasking experience is still the same. Apps can take up the whole screen, or share the display with a second app in Split View. There’s also the Slide Over area, which lets you quickly summon a floating window containing another app. Apple has made major improvements to these features over the years, but they’re the same fundamental multitasking options we’ve had since iOS 9 back in 2015.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6b6425b0-db64-11eb-aff3-fa0a2e2f1151" style="height:779;width:1579;" alt="iPadOS 15 multitasking menu" data-uuid="b90856e1-5353-3a66-b0c6-baf09ed6cf6c"><figcaption>The tiny multitasking menu can be handy, once you know how to use it.</figcaption></figure><p>If you’ve been hoping for a true windowed multitasking experience, this isn’t it. But Apple has made it easier to work with the multitasking features it does offer. Now, there’s a tiny three-dot menu at the top of every app you use that lets you move the app between full screen, slide over and split view. As I compose this sentence, I’m typing in the Notes app, full screen. If I want to take Notes into Split View and share the screen with Safari, I just tap the multitasking menu and hit the Split View icon. This gives me a full view of my Home Screen, which then lets me pick anything I want to go alongside Notes.</p><p>Being able to quickly choose from any app on your Home Screen when setting up a multitasking view is a big improvement; before, you primarily had to use search to find the app you want, or drag one of the apps available in your dock. The menu also makes it a lot easier to move apps between Split View, Slide Over and full-screen views. Previously, you had to be aware of a variety of gestures, but a few minutes of playing with the multitasking menu makes the behavior pretty clear.</p><h2><strong>Safari</strong></h2><h2></h2><p>The last major change I’ll cover at this early stage is Safari. It’s one of the most important apps on the iPad, and it’s gotten a lot better in the last few years. But for iPadOS 15, Apple has made what I predict will be a polarizing design decision. In an effort to slim down the top menu bar, Apple crammed the URL bar and open tabs into one row. Essentially, a tab and its URL bar are now represented by a single visual cue.</p><p>This means that the location of the URL bar moves. If you’re looking at the right-most tab you have open, for instance, the URL bar is all the way to the right. It definitely takes some time to get used to, since most of us are used to it always being right in the center of whatever browser we’re using. This also makes it harder to see all your tabs; besides the “active” tab, I can currently see eight others. The rest are hidden off to the left and right of my active tab. To see them, you’ll have to scroll either direction to find what you’re looking for.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/dfc5e3c0-db65-11eb-bfd9-e616c611734a" style="height:464;width:2388;" alt="iPadOS 15 Safari menu bar" data-uuid="427c2622-b2ed-3e32-8151-bd4ae646b691"><figcaption>Because my active tab is the one furthest to the right, the URL bar in my window is also far to the right.</figcaption></figure><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/327f9020-db66-11eb-8eef-12b4b6d1e73d" style="height:356;width:2388;" alt="iPadOS 15 Safari menu bar" data-uuid="dc5c75df-7e55-3d82-bdf7-f2bb52b3572c"><figcaption>In this case, my active tab is to the far left, and so is the URL bar.</figcaption></figure><p>Apple’s menu bar cleanup also means it removed the button that zooms out to show you a preview of every tab you have open. I used that <em>constantly</em>, so I hate this change. And unlike on the Mac, you can’t customize the Safari menu on the iPad at all. Now, you either have to use a keyboard shortcut or pull up the new sidebar, which contains all the open tabs in a window along with your bookmarks, reading list, history and links shared in Messages.</p><p>Safari on the iPad already did a great job of hiding the menu bar once you started scrolling through a site, so this change feels unnecessary to me. I’ll be curious to see what kind of feedback Apple gets during the beta, because I wager plenty of other people will prefer the old layout.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9a7e55d0-db66-11eb-87ef-b9c8c8e4bb9b" style="height:1327;width:2387;" alt="iPadOS 15 Safari sidebar" data-uuid="ae6446bf-c36b-312f-af85-8bde6d30ef7e"><figcaption>Safari&#39;s new sidebar holds your tab groups as well as usual items like bookmarks and your reading list.</figcaption></figure><p>There is at least one good thing about the new Safari: tab groups. They’re handled elegantly, with a button in the sidebar letting you open either a new “blank” group for you to populate or taking all your current tabs and saving them as a group. You can swap between groups in the sidebar, and access any groups you’ve created in any open Safari window you have. Groups will also sync across your other devices, assuming you’ve upgraded to iOS 15 or macOS Monterey. Having different tab groups for different tasks has already proven useful to me, and I’ll probably use them even more as I get used to incorporating them into my workflow.</p><h2>More to come</h2><h2></h2><p>There are plenty of other significant changes to iPadOS 15, things like the new Focus system and notifications revamp, improvements to FaceTime and Messages, the new Universal Control system that works between a Mac, iPhone andiPad, and plenty more. (You can read about some of these changes in our previews of iOS 15 and macOS Monterey.) We’ll be doing a proper review of all the new software in its final form this fall, but in the meantime I’m going to keep digging into the future beta releases to see how iPadOS 15 changes between now and its wider release.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-os-15-public-beta-preview-191514417.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">577432da-322c-4535-a0c1-734f73e08445</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 19:15:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625253029</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T19:10:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ebc03e00-db60-11eb-befb-c8eb1b44e3c2" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ebc03e00-db60-11eb-befb-c8eb1b44e3c2" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPad Pro with iPadOS 15 beta]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPad Pro with iPadOS 15 beta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The DOJ is investigating troubled EV startup Lordstown Motors]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Justice Department is investigating Lordstown Motors, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-is-probing-lordstown-motors-11625239730?mod=hp_lead_pos3"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>.

With <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kda-all-out-ep-release-riot-games-seraphine-ar-social-media-interview-160055260.html">K/DA</a>, the studio has one of the world’s most popular virtual bands, but it’s latest musical project is different. On Friday, Riot released <em>Sessions: Vi</em>, a 37-track album of instrumental beats with contributions from artists like <a href="https://juniorstate.bandcamp.com/">Chromonicci</a> and <a href="https://juniorstate.bandcamp.com/">Junior State</a>. What makes the release special is that streamers and content creators can use all the songs from <em>Sessions: Vi </em>for free.</p><p>Riot hopes the album and future ones like it will help ease some of the copyright headaches Twitch streamers have had to deal with for much of the past year. At the start of last June, Twitch got a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-streamers-receive-flood-of-dmca-music-claims-131901691.html">“sudden influx” of DMCA takedown notices</a>. The majority of those targeted archived broadcasts that had been up on the platform for years. The company has tried in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-soundtrack-by-twitch-160021851.html">variety of ways</a> to prevent more takedown notifications from coming in, but those efforts don’t seem to have addressed the problem. That&#39;s because in May Twitch said it received another batch of approximately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-dmca-takedowns-notice-193717690.html">1,000 individual DMCA notifications</a>. For some streamers, those notices represent a potential ban from the service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can stream <em>Sessions: Vi</em> on <a href="https://tarabrunopr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=17p1IFooqryAoYIi5o9AB8hb0YaT-9FS2R3Bbhg5NS-c-132231154&amp;key=YAMMID-38170307&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Ffound.ee%2Fsessionsvi-applemusic">Apple Music</a>, <a href="https://tarabrunopr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=17p1IFooqryAoYIi5o9AB8hb0YaT-9FS2R3Bbhg5NS-c-132231154&amp;key=YAMMID-38170307&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Ffound.ee%2Fsessionsvi-spotify">Spotify</a> and <a href="https://tarabrunopr-dot-yamm-track.appspot.com/Redirect?ukey=17p1IFooqryAoYIi5o9AB8hb0YaT-9FS2R3Bbhg5NS-c-132231154&amp;key=YAMMID-38170307&amp;link=https%3A%2F%2Ffound.ee%2Fsessionsvi-youtube">YouTube</a>.&nbsp;</p><div id="cf2fd0060cd84b9dab85f36ba745b4fc"><iframe frameborder="0" height="450" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" src="https://embed.music.apple.com/ca/album/sessions-vi/1573507448"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-music-sessions-vi-171658331.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">065a633f-138f-4d79-8231-392acc7f82b9</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 17:16:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625246221</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T17:17:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6bcc7050-db57-11eb-a4db-4272ac1f1fcf" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6bcc7050-db57-11eb-a4db-4272ac1f1fcf" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games Music]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sessions: Vi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sessions: Vi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Zelda: Skyward Sword HD’ puts Fi on mute]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zelda-skyward-sword-hd-nintendo-switch-230230304.html"><em><ins>The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD </ins></em><ins>comes out on July 16th</ins></a>, it will address many of the more annoying design choices found in the original game. As you can see from the trailer Nintendo shared today, the remaster will feature several “quality of life improvements,” including the ability to skip cutscenes, tutorials and dialogue. What’s more, <em>Skyward Sword HD</em> will render at a smoother 60 frames per second, and include optional button controls.</p><div id="4af312387d4745dfa51ccc01f4845e3f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DPHBRmpvX48?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>But the biggest change is more of an addition by subtraction. Players can choose to ask Fi for advice, instead of the spirit offering it incessantly on their own. Nintendo explains Fi will only appear in cutscenes and when absolutely necessary. Otherwise, Link’s sword will glow when Fi has something to say, and you can choose to hear them out or not.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In much the same way, Nintendo has also streamlined how players interact with items.

As <em>CNBC</em><a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q2-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries">notes</a>, the EV maker delivered an all-time high of 201,250 vehicles in the second quarter of 2021 — the first time it has ever shipped more than 200,000 cars to customers in a given quarter. It delivered 184,800 machines in the first quarter of the year.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-01-tesla-model-3-review.html">Model 3</a> and Model Y represented nearly all of the deliveries.  Tesla delivered just 1,890 Model S and Model X units, although that wasn&#39;t helped by the wait for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-model-s-plaid-first-deliveries-075110301.html">Model S Plaid</a>. The first deliveries for the upscale electric sedan officially started on June 10th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The achievement came despite &quot;many challenges,&quot; founder Elon Musk <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1410948739145994244">said</a>.

Raw materials were a particular sore point, Musk added. The automotive industry as a whole has also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-bmw-honda-production-chip-crisis-124350237.html">reeled from chip shortages</a>, making it difficult for some companies to manufacture enough cars to meet demand.</p><p>The number isn&#39;t as large as what some analysts were hoping for. Estimates ranged as high as 231,000. Even so, it&#39;s notable that Tesla is besting its own results despite cooling momentum and a less-than-forgiving market. The bigger challenges lie ahead — it has to face stiffer competition as EVs become mainstream, particularly from potential blockbuster hits like Ford&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/f-150-lightning-electric-truck-013038952.html">F-150 Lightning</a>.</p><div id="cb994c91646846e0b3282958f0c6070f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Congrats Tesla Team on over 200,000 car built &amp; delivered in Q2, despite many challenges!!</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1410948739145994244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 2, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-q2-2021-vehicle-deliveries-145131434.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">508952b9-b370-4ae1-b47f-bd02bc3eaaf9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 14:51:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625243380</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T16:29:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/af3f7fa0-db46-11eb-973f-97feee3b4162" width="3200" height="2133" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/af3f7fa0-db46-11eb-973f-97feee3b4162" width="3200" height="2133" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mason Trinca for The Washington Post via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A photograph of the front of a Tesla car while it's being assembled by robots on the assembly line.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[1009397468 Tesla Motors assembly line]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM deal will reduce the environmental impact (and cost) of its EV batteries]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GM isn&#39;t just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html">leaning on technical prowess</a> to sell you on its EV battery technology — it&#39;s hoping eco-friendliness (and frugality) will play a role, too.

August 13th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has opened a new front in its streaming battle with Netflix. The company is bringing the anime hit <em>Evangelion: 3.0+1.01 Thrice Upon A Time </em>to Prime Video globally, barring Japan, on August 13th, according to <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/evangelion-thrice-upon-a-time-amazon-prime-release-date-anime-1234784782/"><em>Deadline</em></a>. Together with a revised version released last month, the fourth and final chapter in the movie saga has raked in more than $86 million at Japanese theaters, making it the biggest earner of the year. For those who missed the previous entries, the good news is they&#39;re also coming to Prime Video, including <em>Evangelion: 1.11 You Are (Not) Alone, Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance</em> and <em>Evangelion: 3.33 You Can (Not) Redo</em>.</p><p>Blending mech action with intimate teenage drama, the Evangelion franchise became a pop culture behemoth in Japan and a revered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-14-neon-genesis-evangelion-netflix.html">cult classic</a> overseas. Netflix ran the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-22-evangelion-netflix.html">original series</a> back in 2019 along with two films — <em>Evangelion: Death True²</em> and <em>The End of Evangelion </em>— as part of its push into Japanese animation. Though it probably helped to expand the show&#39;s reach, some legacy fans were <a href="https://decider.com/2019/06/21/neon-genesis-evangelion-dub/">upset</a> that Netflix chose to go with a new voice cast for its English dub instead of the original players. More recently, the streamer announced that it&#39;s launching around <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-40-anime-titles-2021-074304890.html">40 anime shows and movies</a> in a bid to capture subscribers in Asia.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon, on the other hand, has dabbled in anime in the past, most notably through its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/9/11/20860633/amazon-blade-of-the-immortal-anime-trailer-release-date"><em>Blade of the Immortal</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>adaptation in 2019. <em>Evangelion </em>is a big get for the company and success could prompt it to wade further into the genre.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-evangelion-rebuild-movie-release-date-115525221.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">256fa0d5-2596-47bf-add4-bacbbfc3521c</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 11:55:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625223968</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T11:06:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c3b8d260-db23-11eb-adaf-0efca461cd09" width="1280" height="670" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c3b8d260-db23-11eb-adaf-0efca461cd09" width="1280" height="670" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Studio Khara]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Studio Khara]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Studio Khara]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Is Instagram no longer a photo-sharing app?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Vinyl has been on a resurgence, and it seems like the pandemic has accelerated that. When Amazon launches a record of the month club to capitalize on it, you know it’s reached a tipping point.

That&#39;s the main takeaway from a series of comments made by the head of the company, Adam Mosseri.  &quot;Let&#39;s be honest, there&#39;s some really serious competition right now,&quot; Mosseri said. &quot;TikTok is huge, YouTube is even bigger and there are a lot of other upstarts as well.&quot; To stay competitive, Mosseri said Instagram has to embrace that aspect of itself, and that will mean changes. One way the app will change is with Instagram handing out more recommendations. He also said Instagram plans to embrace video more broadly, focusing on full-screen and immersive content. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-no-longer-a-photo-sharing-153127352.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-virtual-covid-19-vaccine-cards-android-074644165.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Android adds support for virtual COVID-19 vaccine cards</a></h2><h3>Its API update will make it easier for organizations to create digital vaccine cards.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-virtual-covid-19-vaccine-cards-android-074644165.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/83903600-da2a-11eb-8ddf-e407024d76e3" style="height:1040;width:1600;" alt="Google" data-uuid="1aedae2b-5d71-35f9-9cda-002eafb3b60a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure></a><p>Google has updated its Pay app&#39;s Passes API to simplify storing and displaying a digital card on Android to show a users&#39; COVID-19 test and vaccination details.

The company released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-000029472.html"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/days-gone-pc-release-date-steam-epic-games-store-trailer-140746800.html"><em>Days Gone</em></a> to Steam and the Epic Games Store, and Sony president Jim Ryan has said that more of the company’s first-party games would make their way to the PC. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-nixxes-163839860.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>But wait, there’s more...</h2><h2></h2><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-ps4-ps5-release-date-171132171.html">&#39;Ghost of Tsushima Director&#39;s Cut&#39; comes to PS4 and PS5 on August 20th</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/wally-funk-blue-origin-new-shepard-jeff-bezos-155036734.html">Aviation pioneer Wally Funk will join Blue Origin&#39;s first crewed space flight</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-flight-july-11-th-031430683.html">Virgin Galactic plans to send Richard Branson to space on July 11th</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-google-tiktok-twitter-womens-safety-143654283.html">Facebook, Google, TikTok and Twitter pledge to improve women&#39;s safety online</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/major-carriers-implemented-fcc-anti-spoofing-spam-calls-090503217.html">T-Mobile, AT&amp;T and Verizon have taken steps to reduce spoofed scam calls</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-leak-121924251.html">Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic leak suggests a more familiar design</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-gaming-lucasfilm-games-160019355.html">Prime Gaming members can claim a trio of Lucasfilm Games classics this summer</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-three-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-july-28th-102027025.html">The first three &#39;Final Fantasy&#39; pixel remasters arrive on July 28th</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-gps-lte-product-red-edition-deal-amazon-123944170.html">Engadget Deals: The Product Red Apple Watch Series 6 with LTE is $100 off at Amazon</a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-performance-boost-120-hz-40-fps-184409958.html">&#39;Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart&#39; gets a performance boost on 120Hz displays</a></p><h2></h2>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-is-instagram-no-longer-a-photo-sharing-app-112009643.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3df38ed-d2e9-4063-8efd-bc8618c2d3ec</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 11:20:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625223527</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T10:58:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3049351-d9bf-11eb-ae7f-fe41bc844706" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3049351-d9bf-11eb-ae7f-fe41bc844706" width="2048" height="1365" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Passive Bookshelf Speaker Guide]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Passive Bookshelf Speaker Guide]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony's $1,300 Xperia 1 III is now available to pre-order in the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had a feeling Sony&#39;s tricked-out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-xperia-5-iii-pro-camera-smartphones-5g-specs-074022474.html">Xperia 1 III</a> smartphone would be expensive. Turns out, we were right. Sony has revealed that the new handset (pcitured above), which packs a pro-grade camera, is available to <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/mobile/smartphone/all/p/xqbc62-b">pre-order</a> for  a cool $1,300 ahead of its August 19th release date. That means the new flagship is $100 more expensive than its predecessor, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-ii-review-4k-camera-pro-best-phone-in-years-150049871.html">Sony Xperia 1 ii</a>, and fellow high-enders like the $1,200 Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra, the $1,099 Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and the $969 OnePlus 9 Pro.&nbsp;</p><p>As you&#39;d expect at that price, the Xperia 1 III has some killer specs that should appeal to photography buffs. The 12-megapixel, 24mm equivalent Exmor RS sensor is accompanied by a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera and a time-of-flight sensor that gathers depth data. Sony says the flagship is the first phone in the world with “true” optical zoom, which is achieved by actually moving the telephoto lens elements inside the phone. While the burst mode captures photos as fast as 20 times per second.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sony also claims that the phone&#39;s 6.5-inch OLED display is the world’s first mobile 4K screen with a 120Hz refresh rate. Inside, there&#39;s Qualcomm’s powerful Snapdragon 888 chipset combined with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage, along with a 4,500mAh battery that supports wireless charging.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f4f08c50-db1a-11eb-967f-eb3b9f3eb60f" alt="Sony Xperia 5 III" data-uuid="bf95b89b-2052-33fd-99e0-a05afc35a21c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony Xperia 5 III</div></figure><p>If you find paying upwards of $1,000 is too steep, Sony is also releasing the cheaper Xperia 5 III (pictured above) a month later in September for £899 in the UK — we&#39;ve reached out for US pricing. Here, you&#39;ll get a 6.1-inch Full HD OLED screen, slightly less RAM at 8GB and either 128GB or 256GB of internal storage. Sony also cut back on some of the camera software tricks available on its big brother like real-time object tracking and the time-of-flight sensor. Plus, you don&#39;t get support for wireless charging. Otherwise, it packs the same chipset, pro-grade camera setup, 3D Reality audio support and battery, making it more of a crowdpleaser compared to its pricey sibling.</p><p>To sweeten the deal, both phones will ship with Sony wireless headphones: the Xperia 1 III comes with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-sony-wf-1000xm3-review-true-wireless-earbuds.html">WF-1000XM3</a> earbuds and the Xperia 5 III with the WH-H910N over-ear headphones. Purchasing the flagship also gets you 43,200 <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em> CP Points worth $540.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-price-release-date-110542525.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">78b3fcde-1131-493d-bbbf-2e0696e82f47</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 11:05:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625224284</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T11:11:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b9fbc650-db1a-11eb-bfb5-6acbc4179f3b" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b9fbc650-db1a-11eb-bfb5-6acbc4179f3b" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony Xperia 1 III]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony Xperia 1 III]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Intel and Apple may be first to use TSMC's 3-nanometer chips]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple and Intel are reportedly testing chip designs with TSMC&#39;s 3-nanometer process and could be first to market with the technology, according to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Apple-and-Intel-become-first-to-adopt-TSMC-s-latest-chip-tech"><em>Nikkei</em></a>. Intel may be planning to use the chips in next-gen notebooks and data centers, while Apple could be first to market with a 3-nanometer processor in future iPad models. Taiwan-based TSMC will reportedly start manufacturing processors for both companies as early as next year.</p><p>TSMC is currently manufacturing 5-nanometer chips for Apple&#39;s iPhone 12, and in 2022 will build next-gen AMD Zen 4 chips. It has targeted 3-nanometer volume production for the second half of 2022 with products likely coming along in 2023.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>TSMC expects the new tech to deliver 10-15 percent greater performance at the same power levels, or reduce power 25 to 30 percent at the same transistor speeds over 5-nanometer tech. The company also has a 4-nanometer N4 process set to arrive in 2022, offering an evolution over 5-nanometer with minimal changes required by chip designers.</p><p>Apple&#39;s iPad will reportedly be the first devices powered by 3-nanometer chips, according to <em>Nikkei</em>&#39;s sources. The next generation of iPhones rolling out next year will supposedly use 4-nanometer tech for scheduling reasons.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Currently the chip volume planned for Intel is more than that for Apple&#39;s iPad using the 3-nanometer process.</p></blockquote><p>The situation with Intel is perhaps more interesting. Intel confirmed to <em>Nikkei</em> that it would work with TSMC for its 2023 product lineup and has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-foundry-7nm-plan-analysis-141532580.html">previously said</a> that it would subcontract some chip manufacturing out to the Taiwan-based company, though it didn&#39;t say which technology it would use.&nbsp;</p><p>As it stands now, Intel has only just started rolling out its 10-nanometer chips (which are broadly equivalent to chips made with TSMC&#39;s 7-nanometer process), and has delayed 7-nanometer production until 2023.</p><p>According to <em>Nikkei</em>, TSMC will produce more chips for Intel than Apple. &quot;Currently the chip volume planned for Intel is more than that for Apple&#39;s iPad using the 3-nanometer process,&quot; a source said. Intel plans to use TSMC to build processors for notebook and data servers &quot;in an attempt to regain market share it has lost to Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA over the past few years,&quot; the story reads.</p><p>If the rumors prove accurate, Intel could possibly beat AMD to 3-nanometer tech, as AMD plans to use 5-nanometer chips for its next-gen Zen 4 processors. AMD now relies on TSMC for its processor and GPU chips, as its previous supplier GlobalFoundries decided <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-28-global-foundries-stops-7-nanometer-chip-production.html">not to manufacture</a> 7-nanometer or smaller chips back in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>TSMC is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tsmc-12-billion-chip-plant-arizona-083518143.html">building</a> a $12 billion chip fab plant in Arizona and plans to use its current 5-nanometer manufacturing technology.

Virgin Galactic has announced that it&#39;s opening the flight window for SpaceShipTwo Unity&#39;s next rocket-powered test flight on July 11th, over a week before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-tourist-flight-123407896.html">Blue Origin&#39;s first</a> tourist flight is scheduled to launch on July 20th with Bezos onboard. The Unity 22 mission will be the company&#39;s fourth crewed flight, but it will be the first to carry a full crew with two pilots and four mission specialists in the cabin. One of those passengers is company founder Richard Branson, who&#39;ll be assessing the private astronaut experience Virgin Galactic plans to offer paying customers.</p><p>The company concluded that it was ready to launch Unity 22 after it finished analyzing data from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-completes-rocket-powered-test-flight-172956795.html">May 22nd test flight</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-01/virgin-galactic-plans-branson-space-trip-before-bezos-blasts-off">according to</a> Chief Executive Officer Michael Colglazier. The company completed the rocket-powered flight in May — the first human spaceflight out of Virgin&#39;s New Mexico-based Spaceport America — after months of delay. It was originally scheduled to blast off in December 2020, but the launch didn&#39;t take place because SpaceShipTwo&#39;s rocket motor <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-spaceshiptwo-test-flight-rocket-motor-failure-172406055.html">failed</a> to ignite.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now, the company believes it&#39;s ready to take another step towards offering commercial flights. The upcoming mission will focus on evaluating the spacecraft&#39;s cabin environment, seat comfort, the weightless experience and the views of Earth that it can offer paying passengers. It will also demonstrate the conditions for conducting human-tended research experiments.</p><p>In addition to Branson and the two pilots, the other passengers are made up of Virgin Galactic personnel. Virgin&#39;s Chief Astronaut Instructor Beth Moses will oversee the execution of the test flight objectives, while Lead Operations Engineer Colin Bennett will be evaluating cabin equipment, procedures and experience. Finally, Sirisha Bandla, VP of Government Affairs and Research Operations, will be in charge of conducting the human-tended experiments onboard.&nbsp;</p><p>Virgin will broadcast a livestream of the spaceflight on its <a href="http://www.virgingalactic.com/">website</a>, as well as on its <a href="https://www.facebook.com/VirginGalactic/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcvOr7LV8tlJwJvkNMmnKg">YouTube</a> pages. The livestream will begin at 9AM on the day of the flight, which could still be delayed, depending on weather and technical conditions. If the mission succeeds, the company intends to restart ticket sales soon and to conduct two additional flights before it starts its paid flights next year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-flight-july-11-th-031430683.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1314810c-78bc-42e4-ba9a-659e2867a9c7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jul 2021 03:14:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625195665</ingested><modified>2021-07-02T03:14:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0f928eb0-dade-11eb-adf9-f62dbecc4e41" width="1600" height="1026" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0f928eb0-dade-11eb-adf9-f62dbecc4e41" width="1600" height="1026" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Virgin Galactic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Virgin Galactic]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Virgin Galactic]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google promotes YouTube TV's new 4K add-on with a free Chromecast]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the start of the week, Google announced it was finally adding support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-tv-4k-plus-streaming-plan-160016212.html">4K streaming to YouTube TV</a>.
