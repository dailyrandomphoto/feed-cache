The UK&#39;s Information Commissioner&#39;s Office (ICO) told <em>The Guardian</em> in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/09/uk-data-watchdog-seeks-talks-with-meta-over-child-protection-concerns">statement</a> that it was planning &quot;further discussions&quot; with Meta about the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Quest 2</a> VR headset&#39;s compliance with a recently established children&#39;s code that priorities the &quot;best interests&quot; of young users. The watchdog wants to determine whether Meta&#39;s headset and VR services do enough to protect the privacy and data of kids.</p><p>Baroness Beeban Kidron, who developed the code, was concerned Meta&#39;s platform made it too easy for kids to sign on and risk abuse, harassment and explicit content. Meta might require a Facebook account (and thus that a user be at least 13 years old), but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s implementing the code&#39;s required age checks. Children can jump into potentially dangerous VR chatrooms just by &quot;ticking a box&quot; to say they&#39;re old enough, Kidron said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A Meta spokesperson told <em>The Guardian</em> the internet giant was &quot;committed&quot; to honoring the children&#39;s code, and was &quot;confident&quot; its VR hardware met the code&#39;s requirements. The representative stressed that terms of service don&#39;t allow children under 13 to use the products, but didn&#39;t address worries it was too easy for kids to ignore that policy. The firm has already promised a $50 million program to make sure its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a> development obeyed laws and regulations.</p><p>The UK could deliver a wide range of punishments if the ICO finds Meta violated the code. While officials might do little more than issue a warning, they could also fine Meta either a fixed amount up to £17.5 million (about $23.8 million) or as much as 4 percent of its worldwide turnover — over $10 billion. There&#39;s at least some pressure on Meta to toughen child safety in VR, even if it&#39;s just to protect the company&#39;s finances.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-watchdog-meta-vr-child-safety-165358686.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">28da1309-e716-4f5e-b436-ade8ef8b1185</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 16:53:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641747239</ingested><modified>2022-01-09T16:54:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/652fa6a0-7165-11ec-bffe-4e625612c481" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/652fa6a0-7165-11ec-bffe-4e625612c481" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Meta (Oculus) Quest 2 VR headset]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Meta (Oculus) Quest 2 VR headset]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will reportedly unveil an iPhone SE with 5G this spring]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple might use its now-customary spring event to update its most affordable smartphone. <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claimed in his latest <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a> that Apple is expected to introduce a third-generation <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-se-review-2020-cheap-a13-bionic-399-130014174.html">iPhone SE</a> this spring through a virtual presentation &quot;likely&quot; happening in March or April. In an echo of past rumors, Gurman understood the new SE would still cling to the iPhone 8-era design but add 5G and a new processor — possibly the A15 from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13</a>, if Apple&#39;s history of using last year&#39;s high-end chip is any indication.</p><p>There was no mention of other changes. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if Apple increased the storage to 128GB or updated the camera sensors (again borrowed from the iPhone 8), but those aren&#39;t guaranteed given Apple&#39;s low-cost focus for the iPhone SE. A larger battery might be necessary to compensate for 5G&#39;s typically higher energy drain.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If the leak is accurate, the new iPhone SE would be disappointing for those wanting a modern nearly-all-screen design. You&#39;d still have a relatively small screen, thick bezels and a button-based fingerprint reader. As we just mentioned, though, price is everything for the SE. The current model&#39;s $399 price helps Apple reach some customers who otherwise couldn&#39;t justify an iPhone. The company might not want to do anything that could prompt even a small a price hike, if just to maximize the SE&#39;s potential audience.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-se-5g-spring-2022-event-151352071.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">309de2bc-5e0a-4a4e-bb8c-fd13fda84276</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 09 Jan 2022 15:13:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641741233</ingested><modified>2022-01-09T15:14:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/88e5d5a0-7157-11ec-af6d-b4427835cc7d" width="2400" height="1369" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/88e5d5a0-7157-11ec-af6d-b4427835cc7d" width="2400" height="1369" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone SE 2020]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone SE 2020]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mars Perseverance halts rock sample storage due to debris]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-confirms-that-perseverance-successfully-cored-its-first-rock-153007472.html">Mars Perseverance rover&#39;s sample collection</a> has run into a snag.

The rover encountered the anomaly on December 29th, but the mission team had to wait until January 6th to send a command to extract the drill bit, undock the robot arm from the carousel and take images to verify what happened.</p><p>The obstacles are believed to be pebbles that fell out of the sample tube when dropping off the coring bit, preventing that bit from sitting neatly in the carousel.

NASA/JPL&#39;s chief sampling engineer, Louise Jandura, noted the carousel was designed to run with debris.

All the same, this illustrates the challenges of the mission — even a seemingly pedestrian task as storing a sample can go awry in the wrong conditions.

The agency has successfully deployed the JWST&#39;s signature gold-coated primary mirror, completing all major deployments for the instrument.

Both the graphic novels and the movie were nods to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spriggan-trailer-2022-release-date-231200486.html">manga</a>, indie rock, video games and turn-of-the-millennium Canadian culture.</p><p>This is a slightly unusual twist on a familiar formula. While Netflix hasn&#39;t been shy about its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-40-anime-titles-2021-074304890.html">ambitious anime plans</a>, it has typically focused on originals or adaptations of Japanese <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-anime-014631924.html">games</a> and manga. Here, the streaming service is adapting a comic that was a Western tribute — and one that many might only know from the big screen. Netflix&#39;s strategy isn&#39;t clear, but it might see this as a way to expose its anime catalog to a larger audience.</p><div id="84f53c74819444f8804382789016c155"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sb3TWNzMSr0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/scott-pilgrim-netflix-anime-series-173848944.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">402f1643-751d-4922-bee5-7c21a05e718a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 17:38:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641663529</ingested><modified>2022-01-08T17:39:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db9a73d0-70a5-11ec-afdf-836ce46cfe33" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/db9a73d0-70a5-11ec-afdf-836ce46cfe33" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bryan Lee O'Malley/Oni Press]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Scott Pilgrim' art with Ramona Flowers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Scott Pilgrim' art with Ramona Flowers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google and Ford want to bring small radar to more devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Radar might soon find its way into more personal technology than Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras.html">phones</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">smart speakers</a>. <em>9to5Google</em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/06/google-soli-radar-ripple/">notes</a> Google, Ford and four other partners have <a href="https://cta.tech/ripple">published</a> specs for a Ripple standard that could bring small radar to more devices in a &quot;privacy-respecting&quot; fashion.

In a <a href="https://www.spin.app/blog-posts/spin-forward">post</a> by company CEO Ben Bear, he said Spin has started <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/7/22872768/ford-e-scooter-company-spin-pulling-out-cities-limit-competition-open-vendor">winding down</a> its operations in a few markets in the US, as well as in the entirety of Germany and Portugal. The company will also shut down its operations in Spain, which could happen sometime in February 22nd.</p><p>Open permit markets are places where multiple scooter companies can run businesses, with no caps on fleet sizes. Bear said they &quot;create an uncertain operating environment&quot; with &quot;race to the bottom pricing.&quot; It doesn&#39;t sound like Spin has been doing well in those markets — Bear wrote that Spin hasn&#39;t been able to offer &quot;the type of reliable high quality service [it] prides [itself] on to its riders and city partners&quot; in those locations — so it has decided to take another path instead.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spin <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-ford-spin-redesigned-electric-scooter.html">expanded</a> its operations after it was acquired by Ford to a bunch of cities in the US and around the world. In 2021, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spin-s100t-durable-e-scooter-sacramento-070020380.html">deployed</a> a new scooter model that&#39;s more durable than its previous ones and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-spin-scooters-202029507.html">teamed up</a> with Google to show users the nearest e-bike or e-scooter on Maps. Unfortunately, those weren&#39;t enough to prevent this restructuring.</p><p>Going forward, Spin will focus on limited vendor markets in the US, Canada and the UK. Specifically, in places where cities and campuses &quot;select partners through a competitive procurement process.&quot; Apparently, Spin gets double the revenue in those types of places compared to locations with a free-for-all market. Shifting its focus to those places makes sense in that case, but shutting down locations unfortunately also means that the company is letting personnel go: Its move will affect a quarter of its staff, who&#39;ll get severance packages and a stipend.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-e-scooter-company-spin-leaving-markets-laying-off-staff-154545440.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3608d9bd-1d28-417e-bf20-32bf8c87a3e7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 15:45:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641655696</ingested><modified>2022-01-08T15:28:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2af822c0-708c-11ec-bffd-fc6b7d129a56" width="1600" height="1006" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/2af822c0-708c-11ec-bffd-fc6b7d129a56" width="1600" height="1006" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spin]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spin]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mobile sports betting is now legal in New York State]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can now use your phone to bet on sports if you live in New York. <em>CNBC</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/08/mobile-sports-betting-goes-live-in-new-york.html">reports</a> the state has legalized mobile sports betting as of January 8th.

New York&#39;s 51 percent tax rate on gambling revenue is much steeper than New Jersey&#39;s 13 percent, and that could prevent the Empire State from claiming the lead for years. Still, this may be an important turning point— New York is clearly large and influential, and the outcome of its efforts could influence stances on mobile betting in states where the practice remains illegal.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mobile-sports-betting-legal-new-york-state-151545679.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b94de9fe-e0e8-4e52-a92a-da54e24cf0d2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jan 2022 15:15:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641661485</ingested><modified>2022-01-08T17:04:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/19331d90-708e-11ec-bff3-086b29e5afde" width="4963" height="3367" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/19331d90-708e-11ec-bff3-086b29e5afde" width="4963" height="3367" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Timothy T Ludwig via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ORCHARD PARK, NY - JANUARY 02: Devin Singletary #26 of the Buffalo Bills runs the ball during a game against the Atlanta Falcons at Highmark Stadium on January 2, 2022 in Orchard Park, New York.

It&#39;s been implicated in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-had-a-phenomenal-2021-150044600.html">multiple crashes</a>, seemingly persistent software bugs and a cavalcade of scrutiny from a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ntsb-head-on-tesla-full-self-driving-safety-170443851.html">panoply</a> of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">regulatory</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/senators-ftc-tesla-autopilot-full-self-driving-192943873.html">bodies</a>.

Nor is it the first time FSD has gotten more expensive. In 2020, Musk (again, on Twitter) announced a roughly $2,000 <a href="https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34452059/tesla-full-self-driving-price-hike/">price increase</a>.

It follows <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-pixar-soul-224512241.html"><em>Soul</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-pixar-luca-review-160036700.html"><em>Luca</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>as the third Pixar movie to skip a theatrical release. Disney had planned to debut <em>Turning Red </em>in theaters, but likely due to the recent surge in COVID-19 cases across the US and much of the world, that won’t happen. What hasn’t changed is the release date: the film will still debut on March 11th as originally planned.</p><div id="287bd2ef7dec4783a4a53c85e4837d79"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disney and Pixar’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TurningRed?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TurningRed</a> will stream exclusively on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DisneyPlus</a> beginning March 11. <a href="https://t.co/CdVd7Pngta">pic.twitter.com/CdVd7Pngta</a></p>— Pixar (@Pixar) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pixar/status/1479550562022539266?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>“Given the delayed box office recovery, particularly for family films, flexibility remains at the core of our distribution decisions as we prioritize delivering the unparalleled content of The Walt Disney Company to audiences around the world,” said Kareem Daniel, chairman of media and entertainment distribution for Disney.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The fact <em>Turning Red</em> won’t premiere on the silver screen is a shame because it marks the full-length directorial debut of one of Pixar’s most promising young talents, Domee Shi.

Like <em>Bao</em>, <em>Turning Red </em>is set in Shi’s hometown of Toronto, Canada. It tells the story of Mei Lee (voiced by Rosalie Chiang), a teen who finds out she turns into a red panda when she gets too excited. Naturally, all sorts of hijinks ensue as a result. Did we mention the fabulous Sandra Oh is also in the movie? Yeah, it will be great.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The fact <em>Turning Red </em>won’t have a theatrical run is likely to significantly affect its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2022/01/07/why-pixars-turning-red-is-skipping-theaters-for-a-disney-premiere/?sh=3123c5346bb3">earning potential</a>. In turn, that could make Disney less willing to invest in diverse productions like <em>Turning Red</em>. If there’s a silver lining, it’s that families will at least have the opportunity to see the film from the safety of their homes.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pixar-turning-red-disney-plus-march-11-222934766.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b6af1d8b-7f39-40cd-b5c0-71bdb624745f</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 22:29:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641594641</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T22:30:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1c5a9330-7008-11ec-9fff-7f85dd87e7b8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1c5a9330-7008-11ec-9fff-7f85dd87e7b8" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pixar/Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Turning Red]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Turning Red]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon cuts paid COVID-19 leave for workers in half]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon, the second-largest employer in the US, announced today that it would be slashing its paid leave policies for workers forced to quarantine in half. The policy, instituted in March of 2020, previously provided for up to <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/amazon/amazon-to-give-up-to-two-weeks-of-pay-to-employees-out-sick-with-coronavirus-or-in-quarantine/">14 days</a> of paid leave; the new policy covers one week, or up to 40 hours.</p><p>&quot;Throughout the past two years we have consistently based our response to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the advice of our own medical experts,&quot; the notice to workers reads. It goes on to state that the 40-hour or one week paid leave policy goes into effect &quot;immediately&quot; and &quot;applies to all employees in the United States, regardless of vaccination status.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The shift mirrors the CDC&#39;s updated — and broadly unpopular — <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s1227-isolation-quarantine-guidance.html">isolation guidance</a>, which it published on December 27, as well as the decision by Walmart, the largest US employer, to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/walmart-cuts-paid-leave-in-half-as-cdc-guidance-changes-.html">reduce</a> its own paid pandemic sick leave policies this past Wednesday. It stands to reason that other companies are likely to follow suit.</p><p>Amazon recently reinstated its mask <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-mask-mandate-warehouse-covid-180619009.html">policy</a> for on-site workers. That requirement, along with mandatory temperature checks, were put in place around the same time as the original two-week leave policy last year, and was subsequently rolled back for fully vaccinated workers in May.</p><p>While Amazon has often been criticized for its uniquely poor treatment of its staff, in this case it&#39;s merely following federal guidance and looking out for its own financial interests above all other priorities. Instead, what the erosion of the paid leave policies for the country&#39;s two largest employers represents is the rolling back of the benefits and protections many of us have come to rely on to persevere through this ongoing pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this week, the expiration of a White House deal with retailers mandating at-home COVID tests be sold for an affordable $14 led, predictably, to those same tests <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/walmart-kroger-raise-prices-of-covid-19-test-kits-11641320476">nearly doubling</a> in price at Walmart and Kroger. Some policies, like pandemic unemployment benefits, have <a href="https://dol.ny.gov/fedexp#:~:text=As%20of%20September%205%2C%202021,the%20country%2C%20per%20federal%20law.">already ended</a>, while key safeguards, like New York&#39;s eviction moratorium, are slated to <a href="https://gothamist.com/news/tenants-look-hochul-eviction-moratorium-set-expire">expire soon</a>. Meanwhile, the US is still experiencing <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/map-united-states-covid-records-january-2022-n1286953">record-setting numbers</a> of positive cases.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon is correct that the CDC altered what it believes to be the necessary length of isolation for positive-testing individuals. But that elides the fact that Amazon and Walmart were, not long ago, offering hazard pay to workers for facing the exact same risks that currently exist in their workplaces. Incidentally, those policies were <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/11/23/retail-workers-pandemic-pay/">rolled back quickly</a> as well.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-covid-leave-policy-reduction-213033841.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8cbddb04-b821-466e-b17c-106ea3703ceb</guid><dc:creator>Bryan Menegus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 21:30:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641591034</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T21:30:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Bryan Menegus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8c0d1780-6ffd-11ec-926d-c138fd36e4c0" width="4682" height="3122" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8c0d1780-6ffd-11ec-926d-c138fd36e4c0" width="4682" height="3122" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An employee works inside Amazon's JFK8 distribution center in Staten Island, New York, U.S. November 25, 2020.

Though Engadget intended to send a few editors to cover CES in person, we later decided amid surging covid cases that it would be best if our entire staff just stayed home and covered the show remotely. In the end, too, we also decided it would be easiest, under these very fluid circumstances, to do our own thing for our annual CES Awards, which since 2014 we have produced in partnership with the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES itself. Though we can’t hand out awards in person this year, we do still have opinions. And we&#39;re about to share them with you.</p><p>What follows are all of our favorites from CES 2022 which, despite some stormy press, turned out to be a surprisingly busy show (if <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/05/ces-2022-las-vegas-covid/">not in foot traffic</a>, then certainly in hard news). As in years past, we arrived at these picks by first asking the editors who cover these categories year-round to weigh in on a shortlist. Then our wider team voted using a ranked-choice system. Maybe one day we&#39;ll also tell you about the dark-horse favorites that almost, but didn&#39;t quite, make the cut. — <em>Dana Wollman, Editor-in-Chief</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Best Accessibility Product</h2><h3>OrCam MyEye Pro</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70b57b00-6fdd-11ec-b6fd-aef18ea25eb4" alt="OrCam MyEye Pro" data-uuid="3d4e14a9-581c-3cc1-b31a-c5643a0883af"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OrCam</div></figure><p>For people with low vision or difficulty reading, camera-based gadgets with object recognition can make life a little easier. OrCam’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/orcam-smart-glasses-visually-impaired-ces-2022-innovation-award-083054174.html">MyEye Pro</a> is a wearable camera module that can be attached to any pair of glasses. Like previous generations, the MyEye Pro can read text, identify objects and faces and tell the wearer what it sees via an onboard speaker or paired Bluetooth headphones. In addition to a touch-sensitive control panel, OrCam offers voice control via the company’s own assistant with the “Hey OrCam” hotword. The Pro also features a faster processor than older models, an additional microphone, stronger magnets and improved tactile cues. It has a new interactive “Smart Reading” feature that lets users ask their MyEye to quickly find specific information like phone numbers, the total on a bill, a particular word on a page and more.</p><p>MyEye Pro is one of a few assistive devices built specifically to help people with vision impairments or reading disabilities. Though smartphones can arguably perform similar tasks, the fact that the OrCam can be mounted on spectacles makes it easier for extended reading or all-day use. The company needs to address some usability issues, and like most assistive devices the MyEye is very expensive starting at <a href="https://amzn.to/3EYsjXa">$3,990</a>. But with greater awareness of the existence of such products, perhaps more insurance providers will consider covering some of the cost. — <em>Cherlynn Low, Deputy Editor / Reviews</em></p><h2><strong>Best Health and Fitness Product</strong></h2><h3><strong>Withings Body Scan</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70baf941-6fdd-11ec-be7b-871e26d3b033" alt="Withings Body Scan" data-uuid="07ed2a42-dc79-34a6-becb-41c4c14c0e9f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Withings</div></figure><p>Withings has been doing all it can to push the boundaries of what a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-07-02-withings-body-cardio-scale-review.html">bathroom weighing scale</a> can do for a long while now. This year at CES, the company unveiled the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/withings-latest-scale-has-a-handheld-lead-to-measure-fat-in-different-body-parts-010059582.html">Withings Body Scan</a>, which aims to bring a number of new health-monitoring technologies into your home. The Body Scan’s most obvious new feature is the pull-out handlebar that you’ll hold in front of your waist while you’re standing on the deck. This allows the device to run an ECG to check on your heart health, offer up sequential body composition data and, most intriguing, analyze your nerve activity.</p><p>It’s not just the breadth of data the <a href="https://fave.co/3FZgmSj">Body Scan</a> promises to analyze, but the claimed depth that impressed us. Withings says that its six-lead ECG will produce medical-grade results and that its output can easily be read by a cardiologist. Meanwhile, the nerve activity tracking will look for signs of nerve degeneration, which can be caused by obesity (and treated with appropriate remedial action). It’s a hell of a lot of tech to pack into one consumer device, and if Withings makes good on its promises, it may become the bathroom scale of choice for anyone who wants to keep tabs on their health. — <em>Daniel Cooper, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best Wearable</strong></h2><h3>Razer Zephyr Pro</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70baf941-6fdd-11ec-9bbf-a79446668d61" alt="Razer Zephyr Pro" data-uuid="b35c87d7-e9fa-35c6-9113-0feae35c330b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Razer</div></figure><p>In a year where many CES attendees decided to stay home amid rising COVID cases, it feels fitting that our favorite wearable at the show was a smart mask. Tech companies had already started to put their spin on face coverings, with Razer’s original <a href="https://fave.co/3zxPzKl">$100 Zephyr mask</a> and LG’s PuriCare Mask. With a gamer steampunk-inspired design, the first–gen Zephyr combined N95 filters, dual-fan active air filtration system and (of course) RGB lighting all in one striking device.</p><p>Razer followed up this year with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-zephyr-pro-announcement-180037042.html">Zephyr Pro</a> and one new feature in particular is worth highlighting: the ability to amplify your voice by 60 decibels up to one meter away. It solves a problem most of us have experienced at some point over the past couple of years: You try to order a coffee and the barista behind the counter can&#39;t hear you over your mask, not to mention the protective plastic wall separating you both. In theory, if you&#39;re wearing the Zephyr Pro, you shouldn&#39;t have this problem. Whenever you don&#39;t want to use the feature (or maybe just want to conserve battery), you can turn off voice amplification.</p><p>We don&#39;t know exactly when the Zephyr Pro will come out, but Razer has said it will cost <a href="https://fave.co/3F2a5nH">$150</a>, or $200 for the starter pack with 100 days worth of filters. Is the Zephyr Pro a bit excessive? Yes. Will the RGB lighting make you look ridiculous? You bet. But even so, we have to hand it to Razer for making masked interactions just a little easier. — <em>Valentina Palladino, Commerce Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best Transportation Tech</strong></h2><h3>Chevrolet Silverado EV</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70bad230-6fdd-11ec-a7fc-1bbf5ab8eef4" alt="Chevrolet Silverado EV" data-uuid="22eadc9c-aa91-3e5d-93df-e7b977cf09e0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chevrolet</div></figure><p>2022 is already shaping up to be the year of the electric pickup, so it was no surprise that GM CEO Mary Barra took to the CES stage on Wednesday to officially unveil the American automaker’s second electrified truck, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html">Chevrolet Silverado EV</a>. We shouldn’t need to explain why Chevy’s best-selling vehicle going electric is a big deal.</p><p>The new Silverado joins the Hummer EV in GM’s burgeoning electric truck lineup (soon to be accompanied by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevy-blazer-equinox-ev-teaser-184112130.html">Blazer and Equinox</a> EVs) and will arrive in two versions: the RST First Edition, a limited-run production with an MSRP just north of $100,000, followed by the far more affordable WT fleet edition and standard RST – both of which start at around $39,900.</p><p>Positioned to compete directly with Ford’s forthcoming F-150 Lightning, the Silverado EV RST will offer a GM-estimated 400 mile range, up to 664 horsepower and 811 ft-lb of torque with the ability to tow up to 10,000 pounds. The WT version will be slightly less powerful but still boasts 510 hp, 615 lb-ft of torque and 8,000 pounds of towing capacity.

The device, available with either a black or white finish, is also equipped with dedicated buttons for streaming services to give you one-touch access. Sure, you’ll need a Samsung TV to use it, but the greener power sources certainly help the device live up to its name.

Their one big weakness is brightness: LCDs rely on backlights that can reach far beyond a single OLED, which can&#39;t burn too hot or they risk failure. OLEDs also lose a bit of color accuracy the brighter they get. Now Samsung believes it has a solution: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-qd-oled-215038108.html">QD-Display</a>, an updated OLED technology that relies on quantum dots to supercharge colors and deliver more brightness. On paper, it seems like the biggest advancement in TV technology we’ve seen in years.</p><p>While Samsung isn&#39;t showing off its own QD-Display TVs yet, Sony leapt at the chance to adopt the technology for its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-2022-oled-mini-led-google-tv-lineup-150041942.html?src=rss">A95K premium TV</a>.

Sony revealed the name, logo and specs for its next virtual reality headset, PlayStation VR2, and even though the device didn’t make an appearance, the details were enough to get us excited about the upcoming headset.</p><p>The PS VR2 has a display resolution of 2,000 x 2,040 for each eye, a 110-degree field of view, 4K HDR capabilities and frame rates of 90Hz or 120Hz. The new device has upgraded eye-tracking software and it also supports foveated rendering, a gaze-based feature common in high-end PC headsets. The addition of inside-out tracking means it doesn’t require an external camera – a nice step up from the original PS VR. The most surprising detail about the PS VR2 is the fact that it includes an internal motor that can make the headset vibrate, providing a new level of haptic feedback (or maybe just a headache).</p><p>In addition to all those details, Sony confirmed an original game in the Horizon universe is heading exclusively to the headset, and developer Guerrilla gave us a quick tease of first-person robot-dino hunting.

But as we learned more about these sleek laptops, available with 13- and 16-inch screens, we were impressed with their focus on sustainability, including materials like recycled aluminum and vegan leather, and a charger made of 90 percent recyclable material. Even the packaging is 100 percent recyclable, thanks to compostable materials like bamboo and sugarcane.</p><p>We haven’t even talked about the potentially solid performance. The Z13 and Z16 are the result of a collaboration with AMD. In fact, these are among the first machines with AMD’s high-performance Ryzen PRO 6000 Series laptop processors.

Traditional tires are resource intensive to produce and difficult to dispose of, with only a small fraction of them ending up actually being recycled. As such, Goodyear two years ago set an ambitious goal for itself: develop a 100-percent sustainable tire by 2030. Two years into this project, the company is already well on its way toward meeting that goal.</p><p>Earlier this week, the company unveiled its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/goodyear-prototype-tire-70-percent-sustainable-materials-170024650.html">70-percent sustainable concept tire</a>, which features 13 ingredients across nine different tire components that were formerly made with petroleum and other non-renewable resources. For example, carbon black and other petrol-based rubbers are typically used as filler materials to enhance a tire’s durability and usable lifespan. Goodyear has substituted these with more eco-friendly methane, carbon dioxide and plant-based oil, all of which are produced in ways that generate fewer greenhouse gasses than carbon black. Additionally, Goodyear employs silica, which increases a tire’s grip on the road, that has been derived from rice husk ash, a common by-product of the rice milling process.</p><p>Whether Goodyear releases a tire utilizing all of its sustainable technologies by 2030, or simply works individual materials into upcoming models, the environment still stands to benefit. — <em>Andrew Tarantola, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best Wildcard</strong></h2><h3>BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70bb2053-6fdd-11ec-bf5d-774ff467dc74" alt="BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink" data-uuid="55a49538-051a-3199-8253-edad8ce765c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>When it comes to CES, there are so many left-field products on display that it can sometimes be hard to define a “wildcard.” Is it a futuristic concept, a bizarre novelty, or simply something you had no idea would be good until it was presented to you? This year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bm-ws-color-changing-car-concept-works-just-like-an-e-reader-190051033.html">BMW’s iX Flow featuring E Ink</a> ticked the “well, we didn’t expect <em>that</em>” box the hardest, and it’s certainly a striking concept. Essentially, BMW coated the skin of its iX car with the same electrophoretic coating you’ll find in most e-readers. The pitch being that, at the touch of a button, you can change the color of your vehicle to reflect your current mood. You know, as one does.</p><p>Of course, while the BMW iX itself is a road-ready car, the E Ink coating isn’t something you can expect to buy in the near future. But even being able to switch from black to white makes plenty of sense in these more energy-conscious times. In warm weather, you can paint the car white and help reflect some of the sun’s heat, reducing the drain on your AC. And when it gets cold, you can reverse the process, helping to store up more warmth to keep you, and your battery, nice and cozy. Even better, if the company gets a color E Ink version working, then we never need to worry about being stuck with someone else’s idea of a good paint job. — <em>Daniel Cooper, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Best of the Best</strong></h2><h3>Chevrolet Silverado EV</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/70b57b01-6fdd-11ec-bfea-1b4563453bcd" alt="Chevrolet Silverado EV" data-uuid="fffe881d-86d5-39a4-a5df-ad90b7331341"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chevrolet</div></figure><p>CES 2022 brought us a bevy of innovative announcements from the automotive industry, from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bm-ws-color-changing-car-concept-works-just-like-an-e-reader-190051033.html">chameleon-skinned BMWs</a> to a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-solar-powered-long-range-ev-concept-183758507.html">sun-soaked 600-mile electric Mercedes</a>. But as ranked-choice systems are wont to do, there can be only one overall winner. This year, the king of the CES hill is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html">Chevrolet’s Silverado EV</a>, an electrified pickup that is sure to give both global warming and rival EV, the Ford F-150 Lightning, a run for their money.</p><p>The Silverado is already one of America’s most popular pickup models, having sold more than half a million US units in 2021 alone. Pickups and SUVs in general are far and away the best selling vehicle types in the US but those same buyers have historically been reticent to adopt more eco-friendly alternatives to conventional internal combustion cars and trucks — heck, just a few years ago many diesel owners were giddily “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal">rolling coal</a>” for the social media clout. But as fuel prices and sea surface temperatures continue to rise, the prospect of driving up to 400 miles (or more!) using nothing but a battery has become a compelling feature for drivers and automakers alike.</p><p>GM has already pledged to sell “<a href="https://www.gm.com/electric-vehicles">30 new global electric vehicles by 2025</a>” starting with the Hummer EV, which is already being delivered to early buyers. The Chevy Silverado, Blazer, Equinox and GMC Sierra all poised for production runs of their own starting in 2023. And once these EVs roll off their respective assembly lines, they’ll be faced with stiff competition from Ford, Tesla, Rivian, Toyota and other car makers eager to cash in on America’s newfound love affair with electrified pickups. — <em>Andrew Tarantola, Senior Editor</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/engadget-best-of-ces-2022-200032353.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02244675-cc27-4358-9c45-52428c32edb8</guid><dc:creator>Engadget</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 20:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641597129</ingested><modified>2022-01-08T03:42:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Engadget]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/82e3c660-6f38-11ec-a269-37e42d3c7212" width="1657" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/82e15560-6f38-11ec-a9eb-c48026dd2e68" width="1807" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AP Photo/Joe Buglewicz / Engadget (Illustration)]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Engadget Best of CES 2022]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Engadget Best of CES 2022]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[IKEA and Sonos refresh the Symfonisk bookshelf speaker with a faster processor]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Without much fanfare, IKEA and Sonos have released a second-generation version of their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-ikea-symfonisk-review.html">Symfonisk bookshelf</a> speaker.

It also comes with a longer power cable.</p><p>However, looking at the new model next to its first-generation counterpart, the most visible change is an updated button layout that sees the volume controls next to one another instead of being separated by the play/pause button as was previously the case.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sonos updates its speakers in this way from time to time to make them more future-proof. In 2019, for instance, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-06-sonos-one-gen-2-speaker.html">refreshed the Sonos One</a> to add Bluetooth LE, a newer processor and more memory. More recently, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-one-sl-refresh-155011697.html">tweaked the Sonos One SL</a> to add a more efficient wireless radio.

Since the start of the year, the automaker’s forums have been flooded with reports of people complaining that the clocks and calendars in their vehicles are stuck in the year 2002.</p><p>The issue appears to be widespread. It’s affecting <a href="https://www.ridgelineownersclub.com/threads/time-date-issues-beginning-january-1-2022-latest-update-in-first-post.230330/">Honda</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Acura/comments/rv4cj1/digital_clock_issue/">Acura</a> models with GPS navigation systems manufactured between 2004 and 2012, and there have been reports of people encountering the problem in the US, Canada and UK. What’s more, there doesn’t appear to a fix at the moment. Each time someone starts their car, the clock resets – even if they went to manually set it beforehand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Honda is aware of a potential concern related to the clock display on certain older Acura and Honda models equipped with navigation systems,” a spokesperson for the automaker told <a href="https://jalopnik.com/honda-clocks-are-stuck-20-years-in-the-past-and-this-mi-1848306970"><em><ins>Jalopnik</ins></em></a>. “We are currently investigating this issue to determine possible countermeasures and have no additional details to share at this time.”</p><p>The problem appears to stem from a coding oversight. When a GPS satellite broadcasts the date, it does so using a binary 10 digit number that includes a reference to the week. A single GPS epoch includes 1023 weeks, with the system rolling over on week 1,024. After the first GPS systems started counting time in 1980, they rolled over in 1999, and then again in 2019. If a system isn’t properly coded to account for those rollovers, what can happen is exactly what we’re seeing here with Honda’s vehicles: they go back to when the calendar started.</p><p>Humorously, this isn’t the first time Honda car owners have run into this problem. Back in <a href="https://jalopnik.com/hondas-and-acuras-from-1999-2004-had-their-clocks-fail-1798427017"><ins>2017</ins></a>, Honda and Acura models from 1999 to 2004 with navigation systems had their clocks reset to 1998. The same issue cropped up more recently in <a href="https://acurazine.com/forums/3g-tl-audio-bluetooth-electronics-navigation-94/navigation-system-doesnt-know-day-wont-allow-clock-adjustment-991736/"><ins>2021</ins></a>. In both instances, the clocks went back exactly 1,024 weeks. Time knows how to make a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-exchange-year-2022-bug-fix-215225070.html">mockery of everyone</a>, but it would seem it has a special place for Honda’s software developers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honda-2002-gps-bug-190248626.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b82d7946-cc72-4611-823f-90ea65608427</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 19:02:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641580739</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T18:39:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c823f150-6fe7-11ec-bf5f-f1557b16d8c3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c823f150-6fe7-11ec-bf5f-f1557b16d8c3" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Callopy]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honda]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honda]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Neon, Valorant's newest agent, brings sprinting and sliding to the game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/valorant-mobile-annoucement-130018738.html"><em>Valorant</em></a> is a game of methodical movement. Your weapon is at its most accurate when you’re standing still, and pinpoint accuracy is essential if you want to live. That’s what makes Neon, the game’s latest playable character, so interesting. She’s a hyper-aggressive duelist whose kit is all about increasing the tempo of matches.</p><div id="815d81e4bcfe4a509408d790dad90849"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtx8CgjRmqE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Following a teaser trailer released earlier in the week, Riot has detailed all of Neon’s abilities. Her innate skill “High Gear” allows Neon to sprint and slide into combat, something no <em>Valorant</em> agent before her has been able to do. “Speed, everything about Neon came back to that feeling of running forward and moving fast,” said character producer John Goscicki.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Neon’s two other primary abilities, “Relay Bolt” and “Fast Lane,” allow her to throw an electric molly and create two parallel walls of vision-obscuring static. Meanwhile, her ultimate, “Overdrive,” lets Neon shoot out deadly lighting beams, with each kill she obtains resetting the duration of the skill. Her kit is most reminiscent of that of Phoenix who can create a wall of flame to cover his entry assaults. However, the fact Neon can sprint and slide should make weapons like the Stinger, Judge and Frenzy especially deadly in her hands since they tend to dominate in close quarters.</p><p>Neon will join <em>Valorant’s</em> roster on January 11th, the same day Riot plans to release Episode Four, Act One. You can get the associated Battlepass for 1,000 Valorant Points, or the equivalent of $10.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valorant-neon-character-details-180007734.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9128ff36-208a-4d23-81de-830cf8ac71fc</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 18:00:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641505421</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T21:43:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3d519ae0-6f39-11ec-bbf4-cadce204d342" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/3d519ae0-6f39-11ec-bbf4-cadce204d342" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Neon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Neon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Model Brooks Nader says someone used an AirTag to track her]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Although Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/airtags/"><ins>AirTags</ins></a> can be useful for helping find lost belongings, ever since the tracker went on sale <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html"><ins>last spring</ins></a>, critics have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/05/apple-airtags-stalking/"><ins>raised concerns</ins></a> that bad actors could use it to stalk people. Brooks Nader, a <em>Sports Illustrated</em> swimsuit model, <a href="https://www.fox5ny.com/news/brooks-nader-sports-illustrated-swimsuit-model-says-apple-airtag-used-to-track-her-in-nyc">claims</a> someone secretly placed an AirTag in her coat and tracked her movements for several hours.</p><p>Earlier this week, Nader was waiting alone for someone at a crowded bar in Tribeca with her coat on the chair behind her. She then visited a couple of other bars with friends.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nader, who shared her experience on Instagram Stories, said that while she was walking home alone, her phone alerted her to the fact that &quot;someone&#39;s tracking you and has been for a while.&quot; She then found the AirTag. Nader, who wasn&#39;t aware of AirTags beforehand, called the incident &quot;the scariest moment ever and I just want everyone to be aware that this exists.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s not the first time that AirTags have been used to track other people&#39;s movements. Reports have <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/08/airtag-car-thefts-story/"><ins>emerged</ins></a> about thieves using them to follow and steal high-end cars. However, the Nader incident is a high-profile one that should draw more attention to the issue.</p><p>&quot;We take customer safety very seriously and are committed to AirTag’s privacy and security. AirTag is designed with a set of proactive features to discourage unwanted tracking — a first in the industry — that both inform users if an unknown AirTag might be with them, and deter bad actors from using an AirTag for nefarious purposes,&quot; an Apple spokesperson told Engadget. &quot;If users ever feel their safety is at risk, they are encouraged to contact local law enforcement who can work with Apple to provide any available information about the unknown AirTag.”</p><p>Soon after Apple launched the AirTag, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-privacy-update-193102233.html">rolled out</a> the iPhone notification Nader mentioned to inform users that someone may be tracking them. In December, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-detect-tracker-android-release-193850566.html">released an Android app</a> called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.trackerdetect">Tracker Detect</a>, which alerts users to nearby AirTags that are away from their owner and could be on their person. However, since Find My isn&#39;t part of Android, you&#39;d need to know about the app and have it installed to detect a hidden AirTag.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-brooks-nader-tracked-privacy-175938300.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1b18510c-68b2-47fb-8236-d2353266d04c</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 17:59:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641578379</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T17:59:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GameStop is reportedly developing a marketplace for NFTs of in-game items]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following Ubisoft and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-blockchain-games-173640368.html">Square Enix</a>, GameStop is apparently the latest player in the video game industry that sees NFTs as a way to boost its profitability.  According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/gamestop-entering-nft-and-cryptocurrency-markets-as-part-of-turnaround-plan-11641504417?mod=latest_headlines"><em><ins>The Wall Street Journal</ins></em></a>, the company has hired nearly two dozen people as part of a newly formed cryptocurrency division. The unit is reportedly building an online marketplace for buying, selling and trading NFTs of in-game items like cosmetics. The hub could launch as soon as later this year. Additionally, the division is reportedly close to partnering with two companies to co-invest in games that make use of blockchain and NFT technologies. GameStop is said ot plan to partner with a dozen companies in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p><p>News of the development sent the value of GameStop’s <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestops-stock-soar-over-30-after-hours-thursday-and-reddit-crowd-cheers-after-report-of-plans-for-nft-platform-11641509212"><ins>stock surging to $159.77</ins></a>, up from $131.01, in aftermarket trading. According to <em>The Journal</em>, GameStop executives see NFTs as a way for the company to return to profitability, but it’s not clear if the nascent technology has a place in video games.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Many of the recent attempts by some developers and publishers to include digital tokens in their titles have been greeted by outright hostility. Ubisoft, for example, became a <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-nft-announcement-has-been-intensely-disliked-1848182203"><ins>magnet for criticism</ins></a> when it announced its Quartz NFT platform. It also seems the negative attention was not worth it for Ubisoft, with a recent <em>Eurogamer</em> report claiming the company had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-nft-quartz-ghost-recon-blockchain-140720063.html"><ins>only sold 18 NFTs</ins></a> as of December 21st. But for all the backlash, Ubisoft and others appear unfazed. In an <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-boss-tells-employees-that-nfts-are-just-the-beg-1848236987"><ins>employee Q&amp;A</ins></a>, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot reportedly linked the initial backlash to NFTs to earlier outrage over trends like microtransactions and loot boxes. It seems the implication here was that people would eventually come to accept the technology.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gamestop-nft-marketplace-report-171819124.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43b1aa2d-6661-42be-857c-a8ecf0d70c68</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 17:18:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641575900</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T17:18:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b33b29d0-6fdc-11ec-bfba-7ef46ce7568c" width="7431" height="4956" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b33b29d0-6fdc-11ec-bfba-7ef46ce7568c" width="7431" height="4956" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrew Kelly / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person browses games at an XBox One Display in a GameStop in Manhattan, New York, U.S., December 7, 2021.

While we likely won&#39;t see the deep discounts we saw in November and December for some time, the deals that are currently available are noteworthy for this time of year. A number of Google smart devices are on sale, including the second-generation Nest Hub for $60 and the Nest Audio for $75. Apple&#39;s Mac Mini M1 is as low as $600 for the base model, while the iPad Air is $60 off.
