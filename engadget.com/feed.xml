As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22807937/nba-top-shot-moments-nft-infinite-objects-display">notes</a>, Dapper Labs (the company behind Top Shot) and hardware startup Infinite Objects are now <a href="https://infiniteobjects.com/products/nft-print-top-shot">offering</a> video &quot;prints&quot; of NBA NFTs in physical display frames. Link your Dapper Wallet and you can showcase a classic basketball moment wherever it&#39;s convenient, not just from a device like your computer. A QR code and a holographic sticker will help prove it&#39;s yours.</p><p>These are expensive pieces, to put it mildly. Attaching your NFT to a 7-inch display costs $199, while a 10-inch display will cost $399. Initial purchases should ship sometime in January. You&#39;re effectively buying a digital photo frame that can only display one picture, albeit one with intrinsic value.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are multiple catches beyond this. You can&#39;t yet &#39;print&#39; Moment Sets, Showcases or any moment that includes either a retired NBA player or anyone in the WNBA. Dapper and Infinite are working on support for all of these, but it&#39;s still an odd restriction if you were expecting these frames to serve like artwork — imagine not being allowed to buy Van Gogh prints that show the artist. Still, this does give you something to do with an NFT besides the occasional glance on your private devices.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nba-top-shot-nft-video-print-151704863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f46f69bb-3057-47e0-8955-c51b28bdcdd5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 15:17:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638285314</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T15:15:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[National Basketball Association]]></category><category><![CDATA[Basketball]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80dad700-51ec-11ec-ba6c-e0ce6c3d922b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80dad700-51ec-11ec-ba6c-e0ce6c3d922b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Infinite Objects]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NBA Top Shot NFT video print displays]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NBA Top Shot NFT video print displays]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="6fcd15fb5d494e85a651e8f295825c2f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cytitYeIvpg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>DJI’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dj-is-mavic-3-squeezes-in-a-four-thirds-and-28-x-hybrid-zoom-camera-023041720.html">Mavic 3</a> created early buzz when a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dji-mavic-3-drone-may-have-a-bigger-sensor-and-46-minute-flight-time-090542963.html">leak</a> suggested it would have a large 4/3 sensor and dual camera system, along with an incredible 46 minutes of range. However, potential buyers were also shocked to learn that it has a $2,200 starting price, compared to $1,449 for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-06-dji-mavic-2-pro-mavic-2-zoom-review.html">Mavic 2 Pro</a>. And that goes way up to $5,000 if you want advanced features like ProRes HQ video.</p><p>Early footage shows that the camera is indeed impressive and the 50 percent extra flight time is extremely useful. Buyers have also complained, though, about the price, overly basic Fly app and features like ActiveTrack 5 that won’t be available until a January 2022 update.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I wanted to find out if it was worth that kind of money, particularly if you already have a Mavic 2 Pro. I’ve had the standard model for a couple of weeks and have been testing it around the French countryside with a licensed drone pilot, Samuel Dejours. Here’s what we found out.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a153a7d0-513a-11ec-9f97-4908f06e84e4" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone" data-uuid="6280124e-7b7f-3f07-98eb-5476d64e7073"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>As I mentioned, there are two versions of the DJI Mavic 3: The standard model and the Cine. Both have identical cameras and drones, but the Mavic 3 Cine has a built-in 1TB SSD, MicroSD slot and Apple ProRes 422 HQ video support.  It also comes with the screen-equipped RC Pro remote, while the standard model includes the more basic RC-N1 that requires a smartphone.</p><p>ProRes 422 HQ is desirable for professional film shoots, because it delivers higher image quality and better color fidelity, especially for detailed scenes. The drawback is that it takes up a lot more space, using 1GB for around 10 seconds of video, for a total SSD record time of 167 minutes. The only way to get that footage off the drone is via the USB-C Thunderbolt port and supplied cable, but it can transfer at speeds very quickly, at up to 700MB/s.</p><p>The Cine model comes in a <a href="https://store.dji.com/product/dji-mavic-3?vid=109821">bundle</a> with three batteries, a carrying bag, two sets of ND filters and more. As mentioned, it also costs $5,000, so you’d need a good reason to have those features. Since the Cine is aimed more at professional filmmakers, we tested the standard model in the $3,000 Fly More Combo. That includes three batteries, a charging hub, one set of ND filters and a nice carrying bag that converts into a backpack. It’s equipped with a MicroSD slot and 8GB of storage that’s only really useful for emergencies</p><p>Much like the Air 2S, the Mavic 3 folds into a compact, easy-to-carry size. It weighs 899 grams with a battery, slightly under the 907 gram weight of the Mavic 2 Pro. It has a slightly larger wingspan, as the arms are a hair longer to accommodate the bigger propellers.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ca0e2380-513a-11ec-bfef-0a522d8f0e5a" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="967a3b2c-0633-3c9f-8029-bf680f4eb1e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Because of the dual camera system and larger main camera sensor, the camera module is bigger too. As a result, it protrudes a bit beyond the drone body, leaving it more exposed to damage in a crash.</p><p>The camera module itself no longer pans like the Mavic 2 Pro’s camera, so all panning must be done by moving the drone. However, it now tilts up 30 degrees, which can come in very handy for certain types of shoots, inspection work and so on. The camera locks when the drone is turned off, and is protected by a harness that my colleague jokingly called a bondage mask.</p><p>The Mavic 3’s battery is much larger than the one on the Mavic 2 Pro, at 5,000 mAh compared to 3,850 mAh. That, along with some aerodynamic tweaks, gives it a 50 percent boost in range from 31 to 46 minutes — a huge and incredibly useful gain. The 65-watt charger, now powered by USB-C, can juice up a battery in about an hour and 50 minutes.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e494e900-513a-11ec-a5ff-566ec8749af5" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="9f8bd17e-fb0c-3a40-8d72-1b48aa98d435"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>DJI notes that flight time is 46 minutes with a hover time of 40 minutes. As you might expect, though, that depends heavily on the outside temperature and how you operate it. In sunny skies and lowish 47 degree F (8 degree C) temperatures, with a mix of sport, cinema and normal flying, we were easily getting about 35 minutes of range. That’s really good, and as a result, Samuel didn’t feel the need to rush as he sometimes does with his Air 2S or FPV. And those numbers should be considerably higher in the summertime.</p><p>Now, let’s get to the cameras. The primary camera was built by DJI in collaboration with Hasselblad and features a 24 mm f/2.8-f/11 lens and 4/3 sensor. For reference, that’s a third bigger than the one-inch sensor on the Mavic 2 Pro and the same size as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-review-speed-streaming-powers-164600927.html">Panasonic’s mirrorless GH5 II</a> camera sensor, for instance.</p><p>The video specs are nearly as impressive as the GH5 II, as well. It can shoot 5.1K at 50 fps or 4K at 60 fps using the entire width of the sensor, yielding sharp, supersampled video. You can also shoot 4K at 120 fs if you don’t mind cropping of about 50 percent. That won’t be a big deal for most people, as 4K 120fps footage is extremely useful on a drone for action, wildlife, moving water and so on.</p><section data-eng-breakout="7a6fbce611004b0abcde2d133fb1c287" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0559e320-513b-11ec-b777-9691454dc46e" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price"></section><p>The larger sensor also delivers better low light performance, more detail, improved dynamic range and a more cinematic look in general. At the same time, the variable f/2.8 to f/11 aperture makes the camera more flexible in different lighting conditions. If you shoot in really bright sunlight a lot, however, I’d recommend getting the neutral density filter kit.</p><p>Shooting at ISO 1600 and 3200, we got clean footage with some noise in shadows and dark areas. However, the noise is well controlled and organic, so it’s not bothersome and can be tamped down with some mild noise reduction. Noise levels start to get excessive at ISO 6400, but that setting is still usable for night scenes if you don’t need a lot of shadow detail.</p><p>DJI boosted the H.264 data rate significantly from 100 Mbps to 200 Mbps, and introduced H.265 capture at up to 140 Mbps. That’s an important update, as aerial footage captured by drones can have detail that confounds long-GOP (MP4) compression. As a result, quality is improved under most circumstances, and noticeably so for detailed shots.</p><p>That begs the question of whether you even need the ProRes option and 1TB SSD, considering the high price difference. I’d say that it’s a valuable feature for broadcast shooters, as it pushes the drone into professional territory. For others like YouTubers or industrial users, the H.264 quality is easily good enough.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/32896c30-513b-11ec-beee-82b2bea0f598" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="a04e090a-4ddc-35e6-a442-2a0ae43f20da"><figcaption>Taken with the Mavic 3 main camera.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samuel Dejours/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Mavic 3 uses Hasselblad’s color profile that’s supposed to deliver accurate hues. In general, it performed well across the color spectrum, whether we were shooting in cities, coastlines or countryside. Skin tones are warm, and while you might not think that’s terribly important for a drone, the Mavic 3 could see a lot of use in weddings, documentaries and even movies. It’s so smooth that it can replace a crane or dolly for certain shots.</p><p>To max out dynamic range and editing flexibility, you can shoot 10-bit D-Log footage. Shooting directly into the sun and other tricky situations, I found that it allowed me to retain dynamic range and bring out extra detail in highlights and shadows.</p><p>One of the key new features of the Mavic 3 is the 162mm equivalent telephoto camera with a half-inch sensor. I’ve seen some confusion about zooming on the Mavic 3, so here’s how it works.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/24c76e20-513c-11ec-b57f-ba238764d678" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="acb2975e-7617-37eb-97fb-76cb34764c79"><figcaption>Shot with 7X telephoto (MP4).</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samuel Dejours/Engadget</div></figure><p>The main camera with no digital zoom is equivalent to a 24mm full-frame lens, or what DJI calls a 1X zoom. To zoom in further, you flip the drone into explorer mode on the Fly app. From there, you can either select discreet zoom settings (1X, 2X, 4X, 7X, 14X and 28X) or use a slider for in-between settings. Zooming up to four times is done digitally with the main camera, but the 4X zoom is very pixelated and not usable for any production work.</p><p>The 161mm, 12-megapixel f/4.4 telephoto camera kicks in at a 7X zoom, offering 4K video at up to 30 fps. It can digitally zoom up to 28X, but again, quality suffers. For the best-looking footage, you’ll need to stay between a 1X and 2X zoom, or go up to 7X exactly.</p><p>The Mavic 2 (not pro), by contrast, has a 28mm lens with a 2X zoom. The Mavic 3’s 7X zoom is more extreme, but does open up some interesting creative possibilities. However, the optical quality on that camera isn’t amazing given the smallish sensor size. In terms of professional use, then, it has limited value.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a73af7f0-513c-11ec-bb5e-f63bccd13581" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="57ed892b-cf8c-32c1-869f-a4d75d87d2d7"><figcaption>Photo shot with DNG and retouched in Lightroom.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samuel Dejours/Engadget</div></figure><p>On the subject of JPEGs, it’s also a solid photo drone. I was a bit disappointed when I heard that the Mavic 3 had the same 20-megapixel sensor and less dynamic range than the Mavic 2 Pro (12.8 stops compared to 14 stops claimed). However, the larger pixels more than make up for that with improved light sensitivity and lower noise levels.</p><p>That said, you’ll want to make sure your footage is properly exposed. The Mavic 3 generally nails the exposure in automatic shooting modes, but it can get tripped up if you’re shooting into the sun. It helps to shoot using RAW DNG files, which give you much more latitude to adjust images in Lightroom.</p><p>Photo quality using the telephoto lens was better than the video quality, delivering crisp photos with good color accuracy, but with one key caveat. You can only shoot JPEGs and not RAW files, which limits your ability to adjust shots in post. Again, that makes the telephoto lens less useful for professionals. On the other hand, it could be extremely handy for other types of work, like inspections, search and rescue, bird spotting and so on.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e6278500-513c-11ec-bb07-47b188e3d0f4" alt="DJI Mavic 3 Fly app" data-uuid="be3be9b4-42fa-3b5b-8350-d8014b1c6f38"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The Mavic 3 is DJI’s easiest drone to fly, thanks to improved obstacle avoidance, and other features. It offers three flying modes: Cine, a slow flight mode for capturing smooth footage, Normal and Sport, the fastest setting.</p><p>The Mavic 3 works with DJI’s simplified Fly app, rather than the Go 4 app used with the Mavic 2 Pro. Camera settings like shutter, ISO, video resolution and so on are adjusted on the main flying screen at the bottom right. The record button and various video/photo settings (QuickShot, Hyperlapse, etc.) are found on the right side. For more advanced settings like Safety, Control, Cameras and Transmission, you have to dive into the three dot menu.</p><p>Once you fire up the app and connect your smartphone to the RC-N1 controller, you’re ready to turn on the drone. It plays a jaunty three-note tune on startup and is ready to go in less time than the Mavic Air 2S or 2 Pro.</p><p>When you take off, it remembers your home position for the RTH (return to home function). It maneuvers flawlessly, helping pilots easily capture smooth footage under manual control. It’s not quieter than the Mavic 2 or 2 Pro, but it has a slightly lower tone that’s less likely to disturb people or wildlife.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/20446190-513d-11ec-bbfd-e2665b6bc355" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="fe8c64d8-4b6e-364d-9920-ef0897bba932"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s also faster, hitting speeds of up to 42 MPH in sport mode. Just remember that obstacle avoidance is disabled in that mode, so you’ll need to be careful to avoid (high-speed) crashes.</p><p>The Mavic 3 is covered with omni-directional sensors on the front, back, top and bottom. The app shows potential obstacles to help you avoid them, while the APAS 5 system lets you program the Mavic 3 to either stop when it encounters an obstacle or go around it.</p><p>We ran it through a gauntlet of hazards, including gnarly trees, power lines and more. It either stopped or dodged them, depending on the option we set. It did skim a leaf once while descending in RTH mode, though it didn’t phase the drone. However, it could indicate potential issues with the lower sensor array of the drone. The obstacle avoidance feature can be disabled in all modes, if you dare.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/449c9490-513d-11ec-b43e-fd2f44091f5f" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="c4e852e9-cd4b-39e4-993b-f7e9943e18f3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The RTH feature brings the drone back when the battery runs low, choosing the most efficient route possible. We found that it worked in all circumstances, even around tricky terrain and from miles away. The only drawback is that it doesn’t bring the drone back at a great speed, so many pilots may prefer to return manually in normal or sport mode.</p><p>One key feature that’s unfortunately not coming until January is ActiveTrack 5. As with DJI’s previous tracking systems, it’s designed to follow you around while you bike, windsurf and do other activities. The latest version is designed to track subjects no matter which way they’re moving and continue tracking even if they move out of frame. As this is an important feature, I may update this review later once I get a hold of it.</p><p>Other missing features include QuickShots to do fancy camera maneuvers like circles and boomerangs, along with MasterShots, designed to produce quick video clips for social media users. It also lacks the popular Panorama mode to create stitched photos, and QuickTransfer for rapid WiFi video and photo transfers.&nbsp;</p><p>This missing features aren&#39;t ideal, but delaying them at least allowed DJI to release the drone. Cameras from Sony, Canon and others often have key features added after the fact with firmware updates, so DJI isn&#39;t alone in doing this. Buyers will likely forgive the delays, but only if the updates arrive in January as promised.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8c164f50-513d-11ec-927e-821e549db5dc" alt="DJI Mavic 3 drone review: Cinematic power at a price" data-uuid="a2a6c5ff-ce26-38fe-a3ff-a16f83e682db"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>With its starting $2,200 price tag, the Mavic 3 is designed to take great videos and photos for professional and prosumer users. It strongly delivers in that regard, thanks to the pro-level sensor that delivers stunning image quality, along with stabilization that allows for insanely smooth shots. The ProRes video and 1TB internal SSD are also huge features for pro shooters.</p><p>It’s not perfect, though. Those same users may find the telephoto camera to be somewhat useless because it doesn’t deliver even close to the same level of quality as the main camera. They may also wonder why the standard model comes with a basic controller and limited Fly app, considering the relatively high price. The missing features like ActiveTrack 5 are a bummer, but once they arrive, everyone will quickly forget that they weren’t there at launch.</p><p>In terms of competition, DJI doesn’t have any peers when it comes to image quality (its tagline for the Mavic 3 is “Imaging Above Everything”). In other words, it’s laser-focused on cameras, as it recently showed with its crazy, amazing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dj-is-8-k-ronin-4-d-camera-has-a-built-in-gimbal-and-li-dar-autofocus-system-165716323.html">Ronin 4D</a>. Other companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-11-skydio-2-review.html">Skydio</a>, however, arguably offer better flying drones with superior obstacle avoidance.</p><p>Should these factors impact your buying decision? I’ll leave the final word to Samuel, the professional photographer and certified pilot who owns multiple DJI drones and assisted in this review.</p><p>“I am definitely interested in buying it, because it has a sensor that’s larger and performs at a high level so it’s a big step up in terms of image quality.

Patient Steve Verze received the high-tech version as a permanent replacement for his traditional prosthetic eye. &quot;It makes me feel more and more confident,&quot; he told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGbEFn2w8Pg"><em>On Demand News</em></a>. &quot;If I can&#39;t spot the difference, I know other people won&#39;t spot the difference.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Fraunhofer worked with British company Ocupeye Ltd on a new process that&#39;s faster and far less invasive. Previously, doctors would need to make a mold of the eye socket, something that&#39;s so difficult for kids that they need to go under a general anesthetic.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="b481f3dfda854ad79a8624abf60623c1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGbEFn2w8Pg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Now, the team can do a non-invasive 2.4-second scan using a specially modified ophthalmic scanner that delivers a precise measurement of the eye socket. That data is combined with a color-calibrated image of the healthy eye and transferred over Fraunhofer&#39;s &quot;Cuttlefish:Eye&quot; system, which rapidly creates a 3D print model. The software is particularly apt at making a &quot;realistic representation of even transparent materials,&quot; according to Fraunhofer.&nbsp;</p><p>The model is then printed out by a company called Fit AG which has experience in additive manufacturing for medical technology. From there, the prostheses are inspected and given a final polish and touchup by ocularists. &quot;With a single 3D printer, Ocupeye can potentially fulfil the annual requirement of around 10,000 prostheses required for the UK market,&quot; according to the press release.&nbsp;</p><p>Verze&#39;s prosthetic is a precursor to a forthcoming clinical trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of 3D printed eyes vs. traditional, hand-made eyes, according to <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2021/nov/first-patient-fitted-3d-printed-eye">University College London</a>. Around 40 patients will be recruited two assess the prostheses for motility (movement), cosmesis (look), fit, comfort, mucous discharge and more. &quot;This new eye looks fantastic and, being based on 3D digital printing technology, it’s only going to be better and better,&quot; Verze said in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/patient-receives-a-fully-3-d-printed-eye-for-the-first-time-ever-142528877.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">80ade9a6-f61c-4ff2-9d4c-422fa651aec6</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 14:25:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638282216</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T14:23:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Eye Care]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f5e52790-51e1-11ec-9eff-5477bc17e959" width="2000" height="1226" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f5e52790-51e1-11ec-9eff-5477bc17e959" width="2000" height="1226" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fraunhofer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Patient receives a fully 3D-printed eye for the first time ever]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Patient receives a fully 3D-printed eye for the first time ever]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ninja's 10-in-1 multicooker is 41 percent off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t worry if you missed out on Black Friday multicooker deals — there are still big bargains available.

Ludwig is perhaps <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-record-broken-234452712.html">best known</a> for his marathon streaming session that allowed him to break the Twitch all-time subscriber record held by Ninja, eventually hitting 283,066 all-time active subs.</p><p>Ludwig broke the news in an amusing Twitter video that showed him driving with his manager &quot;Slime&quot; in a purple car that eventually explodes after they get out.

Best of luck and keep doing big things out there. However, the site has been bleeding talent to its rival of late. Ludwig&#39;s departure follows recent moves to YouTube Gaming by Benjamin Lupo (&quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/drlupo-youtube-gaming-exclusive-agreement-211213151.html">DrLupo</a>&quot;) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/timthetatman-leaves-twitch-for-youtube-170753892.html">TimTheTatMan</a> (Tim Betar), along with previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-13-youtube-lazarbeam-muselk-valkyrae-exclusive.html">defections</a> by big-name streamers Lannan &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw1SQ6QRRtfAhrN_cjkrOgA">LazarBeam</a>&quot; Eacott, Elliott &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MrMuselk">Muselk</a>&quot; Watkins and Rachell &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWxlUwW9BgGISaakjGM37aw">Valkyrae</a>&quot; Hofstetter.

The good news is that the Watch Active 2 is a solid smartwatch, as well. In our review, we <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-price-release-date.html">praised</a> it for having better health tracking capabilities than its predecessor, thanks to its upgraded sensors. The one for heart rate measurements contain twice as many LEDs, for instance, giving it the power to determine your heart rate faster. Its accelerometer is also apparently twice as sensitive than the first Watch Active, making it better at sensing whether you&#39;re moving.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the watch doesn&#39;t have a physical rotating wheel, its bezel is touch-sensitive (with haptic feedback) and can be easily used for navigation. We also found Tizen OS easy to use, responsive and proactive with its various reminders. Overall, we concluded that the Watch Active 2 is a well-rounded choice that offers a lot for its price point.

His first stint as CEO of Twitter, which he co-founded, ended in 2008 when he was pushed out. He returned as CEO in 2015 when Dick Costolo departed.</p><p>With Agrava at the helm, will Twitter go in a different direction? Will it chase more money-making ventures? (Advertising remains its best way of making money, but there are newsletter projects and premium membership options happening in the background — and there&#39;s also that newly created crypto division.&nbsp;</p><p>But for many Twitter users, the hope is the company will get a better handle on the trolls, disinformation spreaders and bullies.

The new vehicle is a plug-in hybrid model called the Concept XM, and it&#39;s apparently the most powerful BMW M car to ever go into series production. It will use the company&#39;s newly developed M Hybrid drive system that combines a V8 engine with a high-performance electric motor. That will give the vehicle an all-electric range of 80km (50 miles), the capability to make 750 horsepower and to reach peak torque of 1,000 Nm (737 lb-ft).</p><p>In addition to being the second-ever pure M model, Concept XM is also the subsidiary&#39;s first electrified vehicle in the high-performance segment. That &quot;points the way for the future of the M brand,&quot; the company&#39;s announcement says, which hints at more electric-powered cars in the future.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It will be the first car to sport BMW&#39;s new front-end design, as well. Based on Concept XM&#39;s images, BMW&#39;s front ends will have split headlights and near-octagonal kidney grills between them bearing the vehicle&#39;s logo. The company calls the vehicle&#39;s overall design &quot;a highly progressive and distinctive take on BMW X,&quot; but not everyone would use those adjectives to describe it —  <a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/suvs/new-bmw-concept-xm-most-powerful-m-car-ever-built"><em>BBC&#39;s Top Gear</em></a> sounds downright disappointed with how it looks. Inside, there&#39;s a driver-focused cockpit, brown leather and BMW&#39;s curved screen for its infotainment system.&nbsp;</p><p>The series production version of the vehicle — the BMW XM — will start production by the end of 2022. It will be manufactured at the BMW Group Plant Spartanburg in the USA and will be available as a plug-in hybrid model only.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4eb74830-51ce-11ec-b12f-3e200518ee9b" style="height:1060;width:1600;" alt="BMW" data-uuid="2dc4102a-c611-3f14-b164-4fc36a5aa0e5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bmw-m-concept-xm-plug-in-hybrid-115542431.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">534304e6-331a-40b9-a130-daf15ce194b7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 11:55:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638271043</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T11:17:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/90daa1d0-51c4-11ec-bfb1-c53fb25b212e" width="1600" height="1011" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/90daa1d0-51c4-11ec-bfb1-c53fb25b212e" width="1600" height="1011" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK competition regulator orders Meta to sell Giphy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-giphy-deal-antitrust-uk-competition-and-markets-authority-190016371.html">rumored</a>, the UK&#39;s Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-facebook-giphy-deal-antitrust-uk-competition-and-markets-authority-190016371.htmlhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-directs-facebook-to-sell-giphy">ordered</a> Meta (Facebook) to sell Giphy, saying the deal &quot;could harm social media users and UK advertisers.&quot; It found that the deal would boost Meta&#39;s already prodigious market power by limiting other platforms&#39; access to Giphy GIFs, &quot;driving more traffic to Facebook owned sites — Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The CMA said that Meta&#39;s sites dominated social media user time to the tune of 73 percent and that it could further muscle out rivals like TikTok, Twitter and Snapchat by leveraging Giphy. It added that prior to the merger, Giphy launched &quot;innovative advertising services&quot; used by brands like Dunkin&#39; Donuts and Pepsi that it could have brought to the UK.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Facebook terminated&nbsp;Giphy’s advertising&nbsp;services at the time of the merger,&nbsp;removing&nbsp;an important source of potential competition,&quot; the regulator wrote.&nbsp;&quot;The CMA considers this particularly concerning given that Facebook&nbsp;controls nearly half&nbsp;of the £7 billion display advertising market in the UK.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>We disagree with this decision. We are reviewing the decision and considering all options, including appeal.</p></blockquote><p>Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-144640114.html">purchased Giphy</a> in May of 2020, reportedly for $400 million, with the aim of integrating it into Instagram. A month later, the CMA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-investigates-facebook-giphy-acquisition-141604075.html">launched</a> an investigation into the deal and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-uk-regulator-113520511.html">ruled in August</a> that Facebook could stop rivals like TikTok and Snapchat from accessing Giphy&#39;s GIF library. At the same time, it said the deal could remove potential UK display advertising competitors after Meta ended Giphy&#39;s paid ad partnerships.&nbsp;</p><p>Meta previously said that the CMA had no jurisdiction because Giphy has no operations in the UK, adding that Giphy&#39;s paid services weren&#39;t display advertising by the CMA&#39;s definition. In October, the authority <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-fines-facebook-70-million-for-breaking-rules-related-to-its-giphy-purchase-110227187.html">fined Meta</a> $70 million for breaking rules related to the deal by refusing to report required information and changing its chief compliance officer twice without permission.&nbsp;</p><p>The CMA said that after consulting with interested businesses and organizations, it &quot;has concluded that its competition concerns can only be addressed by Facebook selling Giphy in its entirety to an approved buyer.&quot;  It&#39;s not clear how this would be done, however.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We disagree with this decision. We are reviewing the decision and considering all options, including appeal. Both consumers and Giphy are better off with the support of our infrastructure, talent, and resource,&quot; a Meta spokesperson told Engadget in a statement. &quot;Together, Meta and Giphy would enhance Giphy’s product for the millions of people, businesses, developers and API partners in the UK and around the world who use Giphy every day, providing more choices for everyone.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-regulator-orders-facebook-to-sell-giphy-111540661.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9697fa4-b0c8-4fb3-a9d1-9a74fa124b01</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 11:15:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638270957</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T11:16:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/81aae620-51c9-11ec-bbf5-509a149a9779" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/81aae620-51c9-11ec-bbf5-509a149a9779" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 20: In this illustration photo, Facebook and Giphy logos are displayed on a laptop and a mobile phone screen in Ankara, Turkey on May 20, 2020.

It said that Clearview allegedly failed to inform citizens that it was collecting billions of their photos, among other transgressions. It has also (again, provisionally) ordered it to stop further processing of residents&#39; personal data.</p><p>The regulator said that Clearview apparently failed to process people&#39;s data &quot;in a way that they likely expect or that is fair.&quot; It also alleged that the company failed to have a lawful reason to collect the data, didn&#39;t meet GDPR standards for biometric data, failed to have a process that prevents data from being retained indefinitely and failed to inform UK residents what was happening to their data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ICO noted that Clearview&#39;s services were used on a free trial basis by a number of UK law enforcement agencies, &quot;but that this trial was discontinued and Clearview AI Inc’s services are no longer being offered in the UK.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>The images in Clearview AI Inc’s database are likely to include the data of a substantial number of people from the UK and may have been gathered without people’s knowledge from publicly available information online, including social media platforms.</p></blockquote><p>The UK and Australia opened up a joint investigation of Clearview AI <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clearview-ai-investigation-australia-uk-142825168.html">last year</a>. Regulators were concerned with Clearview&#39;s practice of scraping data and gathering photos from social media site like Facebook. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-18-law-enforcement-using-clearwater-ai-facial-recognition.html">sells</a> that data to law enforcement agencies, purportedly allowing them to identify criminals or victims. However, the company&#39;s business practices have raised numerous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-clearview-ai-police-surveillance-explained.html">privacy concerns</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Clearview AI said it was considering an appeal, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/technology/clearview-ai-uk-privacy-fine.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. &quot;[Clearview only] provides publicly available information from the internet to law enforcement agencies,&quot; said company lawyer Kelly Hagedorn in a statement. &quot;My company and I have acted in the best interests of the UK and their people by assisting law enforcement in solving heinous crimes against children, seniors and other victims of unscrupulous acts,&quot; added Clearview AI chief executive Hoan Ton-That in a separate statement.</p><p>Earlier this month, Australia&#39;s regular issued a similar ruling, saying Clearview AI breached the privacy of residents by scraping their biometric information. The country&#39;s regulator, the OAIC, ordered Clearview to &quot;cease collecting facial images and biometric templates from individuals in Australia and destroy all facial images and biometric templates collected.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In the US, the ACLU recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/aclu-sues-clearview-ai-164518487.html">sued</a> Clearview for violating Illinois state laws. Twitter, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-05-google-tells-clearview-at-stop-scraping-photos.html">Google</a> and YouTube have all sent cease-and-desist letters to the company, alleging that it violates their terms of service. Facebook has also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-06-facebook-venmo-cease-and-desist-clearview-ai.html">demanded</a> that Clearview stop scraping its data.&nbsp;</p><p>The fine would be the first Clearview has faced, the company told the <em>NYT.</em> It can still contest the ruling with the Commissioner, so the fine and enforcement &quot;may be subject to change,&quot; the ICO wrote. The ICO expects to make a final decision by mid-2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/clearview-ai-fined-17-million-for-breaching-uk-data-protection-laws-102806507.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">48a7ba87-bf2e-4de0-9f50-7ed77df3b472</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 10:28:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638278042</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T13:14:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/707cc690-51c7-11ec-a6f7-19319cfebad9" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/707cc690-51c7-11ec-a6f7-19319cfebad9" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ekkasit919 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iot machine learning with human and object recognition which use artificial intelligence to measurements ,analytic and identical concept, it invents to classification,estimate,prediction, database]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iot machine learning with human and object recognition which use artificial intelligence to measurements ,analytic and identical concept, it invents to classification,estimate,prediction, database]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Rocket League Sideswipe' rolls out globally on iOS and Android]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After launching into pre-season <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rocket-league-sideswipe-for-mobile-has-launched-into-pre-season-073500710.html">earlier this month</a>, the mobile game <em>Rocket League Sideswipe</em> is <a href="https://twitter.com/RLSideswipe/status/1465446286841331715">rolling out</a> to iOS and Android users around the world, <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/29/rocket-league-sideswipe-android-ios-launch/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> has reported.

According to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/11/29/amazon-union-election-alabama-nlrb-523460"><em>Politico</em></a>, Lisa Henderson, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) Region 10 Director, has ordered the e-commerce giant to hold another vote mostly due to the fact that Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-retail-union-rwdsu-23-objections-election-tampering-allegation-143104913.html">installed</a> a US Postal Service mailbox in front of the warehouse to collect ballots.&nbsp;</p><p>The election results were 1,798 to 738, with workers voting against joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). After those results came out, the RWDSU filed 23 objections, accusing the company of interfering with the elections. One of those complaints pointed out that Amazon installed the ballot box without approval from the NLRB and in view of security cameras that made workers feel they were under surveillance. The labor relations board <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-found-to-have-illegally-discouraged-union-organizing-in-alabama-035214235.html">sided with the union</a> and found that Amazon interfered with the election by installing the mailbox and offering employees anti-union badges and signs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Henderson wrote in the documents ordering a new election:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;By causing the Postal Service to install a cluster mailbox unit, communicating and encouraging employees to cast their ballots using the mailbox, wrapping the mailbox with its slogan, and placing the mailbox at a location where employees could reasonably believe they were being surveilled, the Employer engaged in objectionable conduct that warrants setting aside the election.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The Employer’s flagrant disregard for the Board’s typical mail-ballot procedure compromised the authority of the Board and made a free and fair election impossible.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Amazon, of course, criticized the NLRB&#39;s decision. In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/29/amazon-warehouse-union-revote/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Our employees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join the RWDSU earlier this year. It&#39;s disappointing that the NLRB has now decided that those votes shouldn’t count.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-election-rerun-073943796.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b8f572b2-464b-4038-ac67-75b7559c7346</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 30 Nov 2021 07:39:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638264069</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T09:21:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Voting Issues & Results]]></category><category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4769e280-ff45-11eb-b7bf-e1c9fe4aa8ac" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4769e280-ff45-11eb-b7bf-e1c9fe4aa8ac" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[jetcityimage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Las Vegas - Circa June 2019: Amazon.com Fulfillment Center.

The practical result of the decision was that scooters weren’t allowed in the city. Less than two weeks later, Miami commissioners have now <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/downtown-miami/article256191517.html">voted to launch a new temporary program</a> that will allow six companies to rent out the vehicles in the city’s Edgewater, Brickell and Coconut Grove neighborhoods until January 5th, 2022.</p><p>&quot;This news comes as a relief to Miami residents who&#39;ve long relied on e-scooters as a safe, affordable and sustainable way to get around. We look forward to working closely with the commissioners and Mayor Suarez to develop a permanent program that prioritizes safety for riders and non-riders alike,” said Bruno Lopes, senior manager for government relations at Lime. “We specifically hope the city will continue to invest the millions of dollars in e-scooter fees Lime and other operators pay into protected bike lanes, the most proven way to ensure the safety of all road users.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Under the new program, riders will need to wear helmets when they travel on a scooter. Additionally, the city will enforce a stricter parking limit to reduce sidewalk clutter. Commissioners voted three to one in favor of implementing a new rental program after they voted four to one to scrap the previous one 11 days ago. Both votes were led by Commissioner Alex Díaz de la Portilla. The short duration of this latest pilot is due to a local city law that limits the length of temporary programs. It’s possible Miami could once again outlaw scooters while the city conducts a public bid to select three companies that will operate under a permanent program.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/miami-brings-back-electric-scooter-rentals-221950291.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">12f67969-a45a-4b85-933d-7c250a634c97</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 22:19:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638270811</ingested><modified>2021-11-30T11:13:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4f0d2fd0-515f-11ec-be2d-f06752b1c0b0" width="3900" height="2601" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4f0d2fd0-515f-11ec-be2d-f06752b1c0b0" width="3900" height="2601" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CHANDAN KHANNA via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A couple rides an electric scooter on Ocean Drive in South Beach, Miami, on June 9, 2020. - Miami-Dade County beaches that were closed due to coronavirus pandemic will open on June 10, with visitors required to follow new social distancing guidelines.

Between 10 and 12 cameras will be installed under the roof of each stadium. The system will use limb-tracking data to calculate the offside line at the moment the ball is played (i.e. the &quot;kick point&quot;). If it detects an offside offence, it will alert a replay operator, who can review the incident almost in real-time.</p><p>“The replay operator then has the opportunity to show it immediately to the VAR,” Johannes Holzmüller, FIFA&#39;s football technology and innovation director, said. “At the FIFA Arab Cup, the Assistant VAR, at a dedicated offside station, can immediately validate and confirm the information.” The VAR can then tell the match referee about the decision.</p><p>The system could catch offside fouls faster than the current VAR setup, helping games to flow more smoothly. All going well, the tech could be used at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The system has been trialed in England, Spain and Germany. There were plans to test it more broadly last year, but the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted those.</p><p>“Technology is very important and useful in both the pre-match preparation and the decision-making process during matches,” FIFA&#39;s chief refereeing officer Pierluigi Collina said. “In an offside incident, the decision is made after having analysed not only the players’ position but also, their involvement in the move. Technology – today or tomorrow – can draw a line but the assessment of an interference with play or with an opponent remains in the referee’s hands.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fifa-offside-tech-limb-tracking-test-arab-cup-200122105.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">068f1eef-4764-4265-998d-c0631dfabcac</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 20:01:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638216085</ingested><modified>2021-11-29T20:01:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7ba90990-514d-11ec-aeaf-0e8e6ad9dba6" width="5121" height="3414" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7ba90990-514d-11ec-aeaf-0e8e6ad9dba6" width="5121" height="3414" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Athena Pictures via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SWANSEA, WALES - OCTOBER 20: Assistant referee Daniel Robathan awards an off-side to West Bromwich Albion during the Sky Bet Championship match between Swansea City and West Bromwich Albion at the Swansea.com Stadium on October 20, 2021 in Swansea, Wales.

The regulator <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-uk-regulator-113520511.html">ruled in August</a> that the deal could prevent rivals such as TikTok and Snapchat from accessing Giphy&#39;s library of GIFs.

That’s a 10 percent discount off its usual $1,999 starting price. We’ve seen price reductions on the new MacBook a handful of times since launch — most notably when Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-14-inch-and-16-inch-macbook-pros-are-already-discounted-at-amazon-143028122.html">discounted both the 14- and 16-inch variants</a> by $50 the week they came out. However, $200 off is an all-time low for a computer that only went on sale at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-event-2021-highlights-194601228.html">end of October</a></p><a class="athena-button" href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/n1Wjyo" id="5262e7c91c4c46f78a16e049421980c0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Adorama;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:MacBook Pro">Buy MacBook Pro at Adorama - $1,799</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3p6KZOp" id="f45f579bf0e54ed8b995f48ce27ae6e3" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:MacBook Pro">Buy MacBook Pro at B&amp;H - $1,799</a><p>We&#39;ll note here only the Space Gray model is part of today&#39;s promotion. If you want the computer in Silver, it’s $1,999. You also can’t upgrade any of the components without paying the full price of the computer. Thankfully, the base model is plenty powerful with its 8-core M1 Pro processor, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of internal storage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We gave the new MacBook Pros a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">score of 92</a>. Apple addressed a lot of the issues that made the previous generation so divisive. To start, unlike its predecessor, the 14-inch model comes with almost all the ports you could want. It features three Thunderbolt 4 ports, an HDMI connection, a MagSafe power port, a headphone jack and an SD card slot. Another standout feature of the 2021 MacBook Pro is its Liquid Retina XDR display. The one on the 14-inch model features a resolution of 3,024 x 1,964 and is capable of reaching 1,600 nits of brightness. It also has a 120Hz refresh rate, which makes using the computer feel smoother. The only downside of the display is that unsightly notch. But if you don’t mind it, there’s a lot to like about the 2021 MacBook Pro.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-14-inch-macbook-pro-cyber-monday-deal-165803308.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">787c3ec4-d15e-4f2a-85d5-c2f23231afbd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 29 Nov 2021 16:58:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638218108</ingested><modified>2021-11-29T20:35:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c2dac60-5133-11ec-bff6-c70a9c578bd8" width="2000" height="1087" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c2dac60-5133-11ec-bff6-c70a9c578bd8" width="2000" height="1087" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Nintendo Switch Pro Controller drops to $50 for Cyber Monday]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While the Switch&#39;s Joy-Cons are perfectly suitable for casual gaming, those who want a bit more control and comfort should consider springing for the Switch Pro Controller or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-controllers-160034389.html">something similar to it</a>.

His first stint as Twitter CEO, which he co-founded, ended in 2008 when he was pushed out, but he was still on the board. He returned as CEO in 2015 when Dick Costolo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-11-twitter-ceo-dick-costolo-out.html">departed</a>.</p><p>Last year, activist investment firm Elliott Management called for Dorsey to leave his position at Twitter. The firm&#39;s founder, Paul Singer, suggested Dorsey&#39;s dual CEO role meant he wasn&#39;t able to focus enough on the social media platform. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-09-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey-staying.html">reached a deal</a> with Elliott Management, which included a $2 billion stock buyback, to keep Dorsey in place, despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-twitter-covid-19-olympics-jack-dorsey.html">a shaky outlook for the company</a> when the COVID-19 pandemic was starting to take hold.</p><p>Twitter <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/twitter-earnings-q3-2021-1235037125/">missed</a> Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings per share last quarter. The main engagement metric, monetizable daily active users (mDAU), rose by 13 percent year-over-year to 211 million. However, average US mDAUs remained at 37 million for the second quarter running. In September, the company agreed to pay $809.5 million to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-settlement-class-action-suit-151202542.html">settle a class-action suit</a>, in which investors accused the company of providing misleading numbers about engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Advertising is still by far the biggest driver of Twitter revenue ($1.14 billion of the $1.28 billion it generated last quarter), but the company has been exploring other ways of making money over the last couple of years. Twitter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-buys-revue-newsletter-service-124341255.html">bought newsletter service Revue</a> in January and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-revue-newsletter-subscribe-button-tweets-163814091.html">integrated it</a> into the core Twitter platform.
