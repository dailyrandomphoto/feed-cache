All is well now, but the Roscosmos and NASA ground teams had to spring to action and alert their personnel in space after noticing the change in orientation. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/science/international-space-station-russia.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, the incident happened while cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky was testing the engines aboard the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft that&#39;s currently docked with the station.&nbsp;</p><p>NASA spokesperson Leah Cheshier told the publication that &quot;the thruster firing unexpectedly continued&quot; when the engine testing was scheduled to end. By 5:13 AM Eastern time, the ISS lost control of its orbital positioning. Russian controllers in Moscow immediately told Novitsky that the station turned 57 degrees, while NASA&#39;s mission control in Houston told its astronauts to begin emergency procedures. Flight controllers were able to regain control of the station around 30 minutes later. The Soyuz spacecraft that caused the incident is expected to fly a Russian fillm crew — that same one that flew to the ISS to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/international-space-station-russia-movie-the-challenge-183808670.html">shoot the first feature film</a> there earlier this month — back to Earth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;During the Soyuz MS-18 engines testing, the station’s orientation was impacted. As a result, the International Space Station orientation was temporarily changed. The station’s orientation was swiftly recovered due to the actions of the ISS Russian Segment Chief Operating Control Group specialists. The station and the crew are in no danger,&quot; Roscosmos said in its <a href="http://en.roscosmos.ru/22425/">announcement</a>.</p><p>As <em>The Times</em> notes, this is the second such emergency on the station. Back in July, the thrusters on Russia&#39;s Nauka module <a href="https://www.space.com/nauka-module-thruster-fire-tilts-space-station">fired</a> &quot;inadvertently and unexpectedly&quot; causing the ISS to tilt by about 45 degrees. At the time, NASA spokesperson Rob Navias said the ISS lost &quot;attitude control,&quot; which is also what happened in this case, and that the event was quite rare.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/soyuz-spacecraft-thruster-firing-turned-iss-122409715.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">89389c4d-0369-41d0-b7c5-b5d5b1ba99f4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 12:24:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634387053</ingested><modified>2021-10-16T12:24:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Engineering]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8a109be0-2e6d-11ec-86be-a96de0b92cac" width="4187" height="2481" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8a109be0-2e6d-11ec-86be-a96de0b92cac" width="4187" height="2481" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[dima_zel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[International space station on orbit of the Earth planet.

According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/privacy-fears-moscow-metro-rolls-out-facial-recognition-pay-system"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, passengers can access the payment option called FacePay by linking their photo, bank card and metro card to the system via the Mosmetro app. &quot;Now all passengers will be able to pay for travel without taking out their phone, Troika or bank card,&quot; Moscow mayor Sergey Sobyanin tweeted.</p><div id="9100c4d4eb7547b1842d7dae5de766e4"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="ru" dir="ltr">Теперь все пассажиры <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D0%BC%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#мосметро</a> смогут платить за проезд, не доставая телефон, &quot;Тройку&quot; или банковскую карту.

The cameras at the designated turnstyles will read a passenger&#39;s biometric key only, and authorities said information collected for the system will be stored in data centers that can only be accessed by interior ministry staff. Moscow&#39;s Department of Information Technology has also <a href="https://www-kommersant-ru.translate.goog/doc/5030021?_x_tr_sl=auto&amp;_x_tr_tl=en&amp;_x_tr_hl=en-US&amp;_x_tr_pto=nui">assured</a> users that photographs submitted to the system won&#39;t be handed over to the cops.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Still, privacy advocates are concerned over the growing use of facial recognition in the city. Back in 2017, officials <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-29-moscow-cctv-facial-recognition.html">added</a> facial recognition tech to the city&#39;s 170,000 security cameras as part of its efforts to ID criminals on the street. Activists filed a case against Moscow&#39;s Department of Technology a few years later in hopes of convincing the courts to ban the use of the technology. However, a court in Moscow <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-04-russian-court-facial-recognition-tech-privacy-ruling.html">sided</a> with the city, deciding that its use of facial recognition does not violate the privacy of citizens. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-tech-idUSKBN2AB1U2"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported earlier this year, though, that those cameras were also used to identify protesters who attended rallies.</p><p>Stanislav Shakirov, the founder of Roskomsvoboda, a group that aims to protect Russians&#39; digital rights, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We are moving closer to authoritarian countries like China that have mastered facial technology. The Moscow metro is a government institution and all the data can end up in the hands of the security services.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, the European Parliament <a href="https://www.engadget.com/european-parliament-facial-recognition-ban-ai-bias-165833826.html">called on</a> lawmakers in the EU earlier this month to ban automated facial recognition in public spaces. It cited evidence that facial recognition AI can still misidentify PoCs, members of the LGBTI+ community, seniors and women at higher rates. In the US, local governments are banning the use of the technology in<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facial-recognition-and-biometric-technology-moratorium-act-proposal-182236298.html"></a>public spaces, including statewide bans by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/massachusetts-statewide-police-ban-facial-recognition-bill-064534909.html">Massachusetts</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/maine-facial-recognition-law-191252742.html">Maine</a>. Four Democratic lawmakers also proposed a bill to ban the federal government from using facial recognition.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/moscow-metro-facial-recognition-payment-system-082754742.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cab4a617-9074-4b5e-805a-e79e3921e8b6</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 08:27:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634372885</ingested><modified>2021-10-16T08:28:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4014c5c0-2e4f-11ec-8fb5-9e2383a2b2f8" width="4575" height="3050" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4014c5c0-2e4f-11ec-8fb5-9e2383a2b2f8" width="4575" height="3050" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sergei Karpukhin via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MOSCOW, RUSSIA - AUGUST 25, 2021: A man passes turnstiles to enter Smolenskaya station of the Filevskaya line featuring Face Pay, a facial recognition payment system to be introduced to the rest of the Moscow Metro stations by the end of 2021.

However, what makes OmniFiber notable is that it doesn&#39;t need heat to change its shape. Immediately that makes it more practical since overheating the skin is not an issue. It has other advantages too. It&#39;s possible to make the fabric with relatively inexpensive materials, and the fibers don&#39;t require a delicate weaving process.</p><p>The team envisions their fabric making its way into garments that could help teach athletes and singers how to control their breathing better. Another even more exciting application could see an OmniFiber garment help someone recover their natural breathing pattern after a respiratory disease like COVID-19.</p><p>It may be some time before we see OmniFiber make its way into the real world, but that&#39;s not to suggest the project is done. <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/ozgun/overview/"><ins>Ozgun Kilic Afsar</ins></a>, one of the researchers who worked on the fabric, told <em>MIT News</em> she plans to continue working on the system.

The company has reportedly brought onboard Afrooz Family, who co-founded the high-end audio startup <a href="https://www.engadget.com/syng-speakers-from-apple-homepod-architects-171432885.html">Syng</a> with former Apple designer Christopher Stringer.</p><p>Apple&#39;s $349 HomePod arrived in 2018 to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-13-apple-homepod-review.html">very mixed reviews</a>, and was discontinued early this year. The company has noticeably failed to compete with smart speaker rivals, particularly Amazon&#39;s Alexa-powered Echo devices and Google&#39;s Assistant speaker family.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Family worked for Apple between 2012 and 2016 and was on the original HomePod team before starting Syng. That company aimed to develop a &quot;revolutionary&quot; speaker to produce immersive audio, but eventually developed a rather niche, $1,800 speaker. The previous HomePod software head, Jason Harrison, left Apple for Airbnb last year.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple&#39;s latest speaker product is the $99 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-homepod-mini-review-140030652.html">HomePod mini</a>, which we described in our Engadget review as an &quot;acceptable Echo alternative.&quot; That device has reportedly helped sales a bit, but hasn&#39;t put much of a dent in a market dominated by Amazon and Google, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p><p>The biggest problem with Apple&#39;s smart speakers may be Siri and HomeKit, which aren&#39;t as widely supported as Alexa and Google Assistant. The original HomePod was also pretty expensive at launch. To make inroads, Apple may need to change its approach and continue to improve integration — as it recently did with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/homepod-15-update-apple-tv-homekit-213444115.html">HomePod mini update</a> that made it work with Apple TV. Apple&#39;s primary goal is to merge its HomePod and Apple TV hardware, according to Gurman.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple is holding its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-what-to-expect-october-18-unleashed-142518973.html">Unleashed</a> event on Monday, where it&#39;s expected to launch new MacBooks and possibly AirPods, but there&#39;s no rumors of a new HomePod product coming any time soon.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-hires-a-new-home-pod-software-lead-amid-speaker-market-struggles-161509987.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0831c09f-0771-40d3-afe4-6911ce31f844</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 16:15:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634314188</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T16:09:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41ef44d0-2dd0-11ec-bebb-4490cce00e0b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41ef44d0-2dd0-11ec-bebb-4490cce00e0b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple hires a new HomePod software lead amid speaker market struggles]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple hires a new HomePod software lead amid speaker market struggles]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weight loss app Noom gets into mental health coaching]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since 2011, <a href="https://www.noom.com/programs/health-weight/exsf01d/?upv=3&amp;sp=google&amp;utm_source=g&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=6465453559&amp;utm_content=379508920522&amp;utm_term=aud-634016527096:kwd-299095591416%7Cnoom&amp;gid=80088673889%7C&amp;type=branded%7Cintent%7Ce&amp;cid=CjwKCAjwzaSLBhBJEiwAJSRokhvAoudw7D9gHYG4L_TK9aBeYv5O_VD8SZqIYA65_CosFG9dvoL2hRoCqc0QAvD_BwE&amp;pos=&amp;step=pros&amp;lang=en&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwzaSLBhBJEiwAJSRokhvAoudw7D9gHYG4L_TK9aBeYv5O_VD8SZqIYA65_CosFG9dvoL2hRoCqc0QAvD_BwE">Noom</a> has made a name for itself as a weight loss app. This week, with the introduction of a new feature called <a href="https://noom.com/mood">Noom Mood</a>, it’s expanding into mental wellness.

Just how powerful will these phones be? Will they represent a good value? And does Google have any surprises up its sleeve? Here&#39;s what you can expect from the presentation, including a few last-minute leaks.</p><h2><strong>The specs: A return to flagship phones</strong></h2><h3></h3><p>Unlike with past phone launches, Google has been happy to share basic details of the Pixel 6 family months in advance. Both the base Pixel 6 and the larger, brawnier Pixel 6 Pro will mark Google&#39;s return to high-end phones after the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html"> Pixel 5</a> &#39;break,&#39; with premium glass designs. They&#39;ll offer upgraded cameras with improved low-light performance (150 percent more light than in the past), and they should tout &quot;all day&quot; battery life despite support for battery-hungry 5G.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The centerpiece, however, will be the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html"> Tensor chip</a> inside both Pixel 6 models. Google hasn&#39;t officially divulged full specs for Tensor as of this writing, but it&#39;s the company&#39;s first custom system-on-chip. The design uses its namesake AI processing to achieve things that were &quot;previously impossible&quot; on typical SoCs, such as juggling multiple AI tasks or processing live video.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/66b4d530-2c47-11ec-b6ff-b422faa324cc" alt="Google Tensor chip inside Pixel 6" data-uuid="d42d876f-6dd8-316d-8660-c95f981d763d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>However, Google hasn&#39;t said much about the exact specs of the Pixel 6 line or the range of Tensor-assisted features. Expect the company to share many more gritty technical details for the Pixel 6 at the event, although we wouldn’t count on enough info to make easy comparisons between Tensor and rival mobile chips.</p><p>You might not have to wait long to get the full scoop. Well-known leaker Evan Blass<a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446818179636924419"> spotted</a> Carphone Warehouse promo pages that appear to spoil much of what Google intends to announce. The standard Pixel 6 will likely compete against &#39;entry&#39; flagships like the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html"> Galaxy S21</a> and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html"> iPhone 13</a> with a 6.4-inch flat 90Hz screen, a 50-megapixel main camera and a 12MP ultra-wide shooter. The Pixel 6 Pro, meanwhile, should be the definitive top-of-the-range model with a 6.7-inch curved 120Hz display and a third 48MP telephoto lens. You may also see 30W wired charging, 23W wireless charging and reverse charging to top up your earbuds or other phones.</p><p>As for Tensor? That retail listing claimed up to 80 percent better performance than the Pixel 5 (not difficult given the 5&#39;s middling<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-03-qualcomm-snapdragon-865-765.html"> Snapdragon 765G</a> chip), but the real star may be Tensor&#39;s photographic prowess. Google reportedly plans multiple AI-driven camera tricks that include a Magic Eraser to get rid of photobombers, Face Unblur to keep people in focus and a Motion Mode for action photography. These aren&#39;t completely novel concepts (anti-photobombing has been present in Huawei and Samsung phones for a while), but they&#39;re new to Pixels and might perform better with Tensor involved.</p><h2>A focus on services and support</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0e78bb60-2c4d-11ec-bcfc-ce631a8414bc" alt="Google Pixel 6 in peach at an angle" data-uuid="0fcfa6ee-54cb-3102-8d66-d37a9dd1b865"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google might also break new ground in <em>how</em> it sells the Pixel 6. <em>This is Tech Today</em>&#39;s M. Brandon Lee<a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1447248490321514500"> obtained</a> what he says is evidence Google will make the Pixel 6 available as a part of a &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-pass-for-pixel-6-pro-194143011.html">Pixel Pass</a>&quot; that combines monthly phone payments with an extended warranty,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-one-vpn-191231627.html"> Google One</a> cloud storage,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-23-android-app-subscription-service.html"> Play Pass</a>, optional Google Fi service and either YouTube Music or YouTube Premium. Effectively, Google would counter<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-one-subscription-bundle-apple-music-apple-tv-plus-announced-174601467.html"> Apple One</a> by including virtually everything you need in a single subscription, not just internet services.</p><p>You could also enjoy better software support regardless of what you pay. Those Carphone Warehouse pages echoed longstanding rumors that Google would offer &quot;at least&quot; five years of security updates to Pixel 6 owners. That&#39;s more than the three to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-four-years-security-updates-152303907.html"> four years</a> you often find in the Android world, and roughly on par with Apple. It&#39;s not clear if you&#39;ll get full operating system updates for those five years, but you might not have to worry about patchable vulnerabilities for the practical life of your Pixel.</p><h2>Price and release date</h2><h3></h3><p>There&#39;s little doubt the Pixel 6 will cost more than its predecessor. Where the Pixel 5 was an upper-mid-range phone, its sequel is an upscale device. Google has even made clear the Pixel 6 Pro will be a &quot;premium-priced product.&quot; But how much more will you have to pay?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f4bc2c40-2c63-11ec-bffd-0bd9f16468e3" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro colors" data-uuid="aa404728-7d68-3a3a-9211-7996af1922b9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>That&#39;s a difficult call. One Reddit user<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/q2qcge/official_price_of_the_pixel_6_649_in_germany_with/"> spotted</a> a German listing that mentioned a €649 (about $750) price for the base Pixel 6. A<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayOD9qDsSq0&amp;t=297s"> source</a> for <em>This is Tech Today</em>, meanwhile, quoted a price of €899 (roughly $1,050) for the 6 Pro. We&#39;d be cautious about these prices, as they could change and might not convert neatly even if they&#39;re accurate. Still, Google is apparently returning to top-tier pricing.</p><p>Like it or not, Google will also borrow a cost- and waste-cutting measure from its rivals: it&#39;s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-will-not-include-charger-200203294.html"> leaving the charger out of the box</a>. That&#39;s not too dire an omission when there&#39;s a real chance you&#39;ll have a USB-C charger hanging around, but it could be frustrating if you&#39;re either new to USB-C devices or saddled with a slow power brick. Factor that into the price before you rush to check out.</p><p>The German listing and other leaks have pointed to a Pixel 6 release sometime the week of October 25th. We&#39;d expect a broad international launch, for that matter. Where the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html"> Pixel 5a</a> was limited to the US and Japan due to supply constraints, the leaks so far already hint that Google wants to make the Pixel 6 as ubiquitous as possible.</p><h2><strong>Don&#39;t expect many surprises</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/074ce1b0-2c69-11ec-b3d1-d5e90fd89d5c" alt="Google Pixel 6 colors" data-uuid="31f08d5e-4a25-3c41-91fe-01197b5cfb8e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>We wouldn&#39;t bet on Google announcing much else besides the Pixel 6 and its accompanying software. Google&#39;s marketing for the event has revolved exclusively around its new phones. It&#39;s unlikely that you&#39;ll see any other gadgets, and they&#39;ll definitely be secondary if they do appear.</p><p>That&#39;s not to completely rule out new hardware. It has been more than a year since Google debuted its<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-buds-review-2020-160030712.html"> higher-end Pixel Buds</a>, and other devices like<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-google-nest-wifi-review.html"> Nest WiFi</a> haven&#39;t been updated in a while. There&#39;s just not much need for Google to revamp products beyond the Pixel line — what&#39;s there is still relevant and functional.</p><p>There&#39;s also the possibility of new or upgraded services. If Google really does introduce a Pixel Pass, it might want to sweeten the deal by offering more for the money, whether it&#39;s a brand new service or perks like more cloud storage. We haven&#39;t seen rumors to this effect so far, but Google also<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-free-unlimited-storage-ends-june-1st-114514222.html"> kept unlimited photo uploads</a> for Pixel owners when it capped everyone else in June. The company knows that services sell hardware, and that may be crucial for the Pixel 6.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-google-pixel-6-event-130025254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ed07266-c5cf-42dd-9baa-a0a0903ba796</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 13:00:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634304474</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T13:28:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/50fe6e70-ff8f-11eb-ba7f-37ef7ae7cec5" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/50fe6e70-ff8f-11eb-ba7f-37ef7ae7cec5" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro in multiple colors]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro in multiple colors]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon slashes up to 26 percent off monitors from Dell and LG]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:deal of the day" href="https://amzn.to/3mTgcnm">deal of the day</a> includes a bunch of monitors and Chromebooks on sale for up to 26 percent lower than their usual price. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Dell&#39;s 27-inch QHD curved gaming monitor" href="https://amzn.to/3j52pc6">Dell&#39;s 27-inch QHD curved gaming monitor</a>, for instance, will set you back $270, which is an all-time low for the product on the website.

You&#39;re still getting a lovely display on the 11-inch model, though — it&#39;s a 2,388 x 1668 resolution Liquid Retina display with ProMotion and True Tone technology, so don&#39;t think you&#39;re giving anything up by going with the slightly smaller tablet (and saving some money in the process).</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-11-inch-ipad-pro-2021-100-off-amazon-123921640.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f321392d-b5bf-4299-82d5-b86ae514b848</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 12:39:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634301567</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T12:39:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[Shopping]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/419d9f70-a204-11eb-beff-582c25470f07" width="980" height="551" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/419d9f70-a204-11eb-beff-582c25470f07" width="980" height="551" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[2021 Apple iPad Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[2021 Apple iPad Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: Diving into the Apple Watch Series 7 and Twitch's big hack]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, Cherlynn and Devindra chat about what to expect from Apple’s upcoming event (new MacBooks, baby!), as well as all of the other launch shindigs from Google, Samsung and Sony.

In yesterday’s newsletter, I explained how Apple was thriving in the world of wearables, but not everyone wants so many notification pings and a watch that needs charging daily. There is still very much a place for simpler wearables, and as we’re approaching holiday season, most of them are also less pricey than the high-end options from Apple, Samsung and Garmin.</p><p>Fortunately, we have Valentina Palladino on staff. She’s written about wearables for years, even before joining the Engadget team. She&#39;s now laid out what <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-fitness-trackers-133053484.html https://www.engadget.com/...">fitness trackers are capable of in 2021</a> and whether you should go for one or shop around smartwatches instead.

According to <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/14/tesla-officially-launches-insurance-using-real-time-driving-behavior-texas/"><em>Electrek</em></a>, though, the insurance available to Texans is quite different than the one owners can get in The Golden State: It calculates for a customer&#39;s insurance premium using their real-time driving behavior. Their credit, age and gender that are typically used by other insurance providers apparently don&#39;t matter to Tesla. The automaker says it won&#39;t even look at customers&#39; claim history and driving records.</p><p>Instead, Tesla will look at their &quot;safety scores,&quot; which is a feature it introduced with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">Full Self-Driving Beta</a> version released in September. That could make things quite tricky, since the premium that needs to be paid can change every month based on the conditions the driver encounters on the road. Every forced collision warning and forced Autopilot disengagement will affect their score. Following other vehicles from an unsafe distance, braking too hard and turning corners aggressively could lower their score, as well. Safety score is still a beta feature at this point, and Tesla said it should improve over time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Owners can now <a href="https://www.tesla.com/insurance">apply for a quote</a>, wherein which the automaker will assume a 90 safety score to start their policy. The price will depend on the client&#39;s performance after that, and it could be higher or lower than what a traditional provider charges. During Tesla&#39;s shareholder meeting, where its new home state was also revealed, Elon Musk <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/08/tesla-insurance-expands-to-texas-next-week-aspirationally-most-of-the-us-next-year/">said</a> the company plans to upgrade its offering in California to be based on real-time driving behavior, as well. It&#39;s not allowed to implement the change just yet, but it&#39;s currently trying to ask permission from regulators.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-car-insurance-texas-real-time-driving-behavior-103501859.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c0d46bb7-b37f-4554-9a6e-039a8890ca83</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 10:35:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634293637</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T10:27:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Insurance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1039dff0-2d98-11ec-bfff-3e825fd294c3" width="1600" height="1023" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1039dff0-2d98-11ec-bfff-3e825fd294c3" width="1600" height="1023" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Genshin Impact' now supports 120 fps on the iPhone 13 Pro and iPad Pro]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The popular iOS game <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-best-apps-games-2020-zoom-disney-plus-genshin-impact-disco-elysium-202554793.html"><em>Genshin Impact</em></a> is taking advantage of the iPhone 13 Pro&#39;s higher-refresh <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-180857712.html">ProMotion display</a> with a new 120fps mode, <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/14/genshin-impact-update-brings-120-fps-mode-to-iphone-13-pro-and-ipad-pro-users/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> has reported.
