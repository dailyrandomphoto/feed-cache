It&#39;s the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/aston-martin-valhalla-plug-in-hybrid-144200646.html">Aston Martin Valhalla</a>, a 937hp beast of a plug-in hybrid, and it&#39;s just sitting there, with nowhere to go. If you&#39;ve seen a Bond film before, you can imagine it&#39;s holding a slew of killer gadgets (though <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32kXCBCoo0Q">hopefully not invisibility</a>). Surely it would appear later in the film, perhaps just in time to save our hero before he sips a martini from a built-in fridge. But no‚Äînobody drives the car throughout the film&#39;s 163-minute runtime. We never even see it in motion. (Though that&#39;s not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-bond-007-aston-martin-valhalla-rocket-league-170014713.html">stopping </a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/james-bond-007-aston-martin-valhalla-rocket-league-170014713.html"><em>Rocket League</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>from pitching it as a Bond vehicle.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6bf4e1d1-27b4-11ec-bf7e-3d899cf99d3f" alt="No Time to Die" data-uuid="59634b11-2157-36f9-b387-25a549522aec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nicola Dove/DANJAQ, MGM</div></figure><p>That undriven Chekhov&#39;s car makes one thing clear: <em>No Time to Die, </em>directed by Cary Joji-Fukunaga (<em>True Detective, Beasts of No Nation)</em>, isn&#39;t your usual Bond movie. And as I watched the film, a momentous occasion after <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Time_to_Die#Release_date_and_postponements">years of delays</a>, I was struck by how few gadgets there were. Sure, Bond gets a cool watch, a classic bulletproof (and gun-equipped) Aston Martin and he rides in something called a gravity plane, but they come few and far in between. Instead, the film focuses on Bond&#39;s human drama: His inability to trust; his persistent death-wish; the danger he brings to others.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d57b958eeac448dab09f60b040461cfa"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BIhNsAtPbPI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Craig&#39;s Bond was different from the beginning. In 2006&#39;s <em>Casino Royale</em>, he was a fledgling agent he hadn&#39;t yet earned his 00 status. He was gruff and dirty, more used to getting into <em>Bourne-</em>esque fights instead of wearing a tux. But the Bond writer&#39;s and producers could never quite settle on how they wanted to transform the character. 2008&#39;s <em>Quantum of Solace</em> was a disaster mired by the Hollywood writer&#39;s strike (not to mentioned completely incomprehensible action). <em>Skyfall</em> was a return to form, elevating the franchise with Roger Deakin&#39;s Oscar-nominated cinematography. But the series hit a new low with 2015&#39;s <em>Spectre</em>, a boring and regressive film I haven&#39;t had the heart to revisit.</p><p>Strangely, even though <em>No Time to Die</em> is Craig&#39;s final entry, it never tries to one-up the set pieces of its predecessors. There&#39;s a thrilling motorcycle chase early on, which features an astounding practical jump up a flight of stairs, a balletic shoot-out in Cuba, and a few smaller sequences later on. But the film cares less about spectacle than it does setting a mood. That may make it a divisive entry for some, but as someone fascinated by emotional action movies, like Michael Mann&#39;s much-maligned <em>Miami Vice</em> reboot, I found it endlessly compelling. (It helps that <em>No Time to Die</em>, like <em>Casino Royale</em> before it, actually makes you care about Bond and everyone in his orbit.)</p><section data-eng-breakout="835841017bec42db9540a498822dd939" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/28b69160-27b5-11ec-bbfe-5a58e596c8ef" alt="No Time to Die"></section><p>When I chatted with <em>No Time to Die&#39;s</em> VFX supervisor, Charlie Noble, he had a hard time pointing to a specific whiz-bang set-piece. Unlike Tom Cruise&#39;s latest <em>Mission Impossible </em>movies, this Bond outing isn&#39;t built around a specific stunt or gadget. And after the emptiness of <em>Spectre</em>, I&#39;m all for that. Noble says he&#39;s more concerned with subtle VFX work, like adding additional cars to the background of a chase, or removing wires from a dangerous stunt. Sometimes the best visual effects are the ones you don&#39;t even notice.</p><p>There&#39;s something genuinely refreshing about <em>No Time to Die&#39;s</em> practically lo-fi approach to action, especially after living through more than a decade of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-24-black-panther-vfx-models.html">Marvel Cinematic Universe&#39;s often weightless CG</a>. Even something that&#39;s genuinely high-tech in the film, like a series of magnets the villains use to jump down an elevator shaft, aren&#39;t dwelled upon. Instead, the focus is on what that action means (in this case, it&#39;s a group of baddies stealing a potentially world-ending nanovirus from a high-security research facility.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6bf4e1d0-27b4-11ec-b8f7-4c7b13083f3d" alt="No Time to Die" data-uuid="ad1552c3-a048-3b24-92a1-bd723b8a7110"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nicola Dove/DANJAQ, MGM</div></figure><p>Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBlOc79L0So">love a good Bond gadget</a> or two. But for an aging franchise that seriously needs to reckon with its sexist and colonialist origins, I&#39;m glad that <em>No Time to Die</em> decided to focus more on its characters. That includes Lashana Lynch&#39;s Nomi, who wastes no time taking up the 007 mantle when Bond disappears, as well as Paloma, a fresh spy recruit who joins for an action romp in Cuba.&nbsp;</p><p>Daniel Craig may no longer be Bond, but this is a fitting end for his tenure. And the toys aren&#39;t going anywhere‚Äînow anyone can use them.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/no-time-to-die-review-james-bond-gadget-150053429.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dc6884cd-ca9d-484a-9cc5-11788a729d56</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 15:00:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633704490</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T14:48:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/28b8db50-27b5-11ec-b5f3-618ade982530" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/28b8db50-27b5-11ec-b5f3-618ade982530" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MGM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[No Time to Die]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[No Time to Die]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Carol smart exercise bike is a $2,400 paradox]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you had the opportunity, would you pay more in order to use an exercise bike less frequently?

At the end of its standard program, it even tells you that you can go to the gym if you <em>want </em>to, rather than because you <em>need</em> to. But stealing back all of those hours from the capricious gods of exercise comes at a price: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$2,395" href="https://fave.co/3mzUvZl">$2,395</a>, plus $12 per month after the first three months. It‚Äôs up to you to decide if that eye-watering fee is worth swerving all of those cardio sessions.</p><h2><strong>Science</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b37d51e0-281d-11ec-9bf7-33fcb3bb2b37" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="cbb2dda7-b6bc-3ba7-bec1-5e6cfa77d469"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Carol leverages the principles of Reduced Exertion, High Intensity Interval Training (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6388288/">REHIIT</a>), a variation on the Tabata method of HIIT. Put simply, you‚Äôre asked to exercise at a very high intensity for a very short period of time, rather than a long period of time in a steady state. In this example, Carol says that its standard sub-nine-minute workout gives you the equivalent workout to a 45-minute jog. This involves you going all-out for 20 seconds, but then having the better part of three minutes to recover.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That 20-second frenzy is designed to deplete your body‚Äôs stores of glycogen and pushes the heart rate through the roof. The long recovery time is designed to reset your body, enabling you to grind out far more from your muscles than you would in a standard Tabata workout. And <a href="https://carolbike.com/app/uploads/2021/03/Beneficial-effects-of-REHIT.pdf">studies</a> have shown that, at least in male participants, a six-week <a href="https://carolbike.com/app/uploads/2021/03/Beneficial-effects-of-REHIT.pdf">REHIIT program</a> can improve their insulin resistance and oxygen consumption.</p><p>‚ÄúOne of the things I like about REHIIT is the long length of the recovery periods,‚Äù says Stuart Moore, trainer and owner of <a href="http://www.wheelfitness.co.uk/">Wheel Fitness</a>, a specialist cycling practice. ‚ÄúThis enables people without a lot of experience to recover properly between bouts of hard work and then go again with another round.‚Äù He added that ‚Äúall interval training can be useful,‚Äù but stressed that would-be adopters ‚Äúshould get the important checks with your doctor‚Äù before trying this sort of thing. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd prefer complete beginners to interval training try something more mild than modified versions of HIIT,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúthis could help with developing a base before delving into the more intense exercise later.‚Äù</p><p>Andrea Speir, co-founder and lead trainer at <a href="https://www.speirpilates.com/">Speir Pilates</a>, added that the psychological benefits on neophyte exercisers were crucial. ‚ÄúBecause it spikes the heart rate and improves VO2 Max, cardiac output and boosts the metabolism [...] without being too strenuous,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not as daunting to commit to it three-to-five times a week, which is where you really see great results,‚Äù she added.</p><h2><strong>History</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b37d51e0-281d-11ec-b4b7-bb0910ec149e" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="14fdecbc-f0ab-3236-a442-99e1247ce258"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>It‚Äôs not often that a company founder announces that their product exists because of a BBC documentary, but Carol isn‚Äôt exactly a standard Silicon Valley story. Co-founder Ulrich Dempfle was a management consultant working with the UK‚Äôs National Health Service on behalf of firms like McKinsey and PWC. Part of his role was to look for ways to encourage people to exercise more, despite the fact they would often say they didn‚Äôt have enough time to become gym bunnies. It wasn‚Äôt until he watched 2012‚Äôs <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01cywtq"><em>The Truth About Exercise</em></a> that he became a convert to REHIIT.</p><p>The documentary was fronted by Dr. Michael Mosely, who is chiefly responsible for making intermittent fasting mainstream in the UK. One of Mosely‚Äôs gimmicks has always been to look for more efficient ways to feel healthy, and this was a love letter to REHIIT. Dempfle and his team contacted the academics whose research was featured in order to get a look at their equipment. Dempfle explained that the bikes featured had their intensity controlled by one of the academics while a person exercised on them, and that the price was astronomical. It was here that the idea of building an affordable REHIIT bike was more or less born. In fact, Carol would wind up being featured in a Mosley‚Äôs 2018 follow-up documentary, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b09qjl7d/the-truth-about-15-getting-fit"><em>The Truth About Getting Fit</em></a>, albeit not named because of the BBC‚Äôs rules against product placement.</p><h2><strong>Bike</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b38e1ac0-281d-11ec-9bbf-97517386540d" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="d9187649-82cc-3a51-9daa-a6ac19e0d7b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>At first glance, Carol could be mistaken for pretty much any at-home exercise bike. It has a very large, rear-slung flywheel and a beefy drive unit, which houses the system to electronically control the resistance, the secret sauce behind the REHIIT program. A pair of short handles with the customary heart rate-monitoring electrodes sit below the display housing, which holds a 10.1-inch screen. The seat height and distance is adjustable, as well as the height of the handlebars, and there are toe cages and clips on the pedals, for pro cyclists.</p><p>After you‚Äôve registered, you can then log in to the bike, which is a process you‚Äôll have to do every time you want to use it. After the first attempt, you can just tap on your initials on a list of stored users, but there‚Äôs no way to stay logged in by default. Given how beefy the bike is, and that it‚Äôs designed for both at-home and professional use, I feel as if this makes it well-suited to offices and gyms, more so than people‚Äôs homes. You could easily see this in the corner of a small business, with staff members getting their 10 minutes each day as they take a break from their work.</p><h2><strong>Display</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b38df3b0-281d-11ec-ad94-fb837fbfb6fb" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="13f19990-1bb5-3901-a63c-3d122ec36715"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>When it comes to screens, there are two schools of thought dominating the at-home fitness market. Peloton‚Äôs ubiquity means that consumers may soon expect all machines to have a glossy, massive HD display as the default. Companies like Wattbike, Concept2 and others, however, are happy pushing out machines that still leverage old-school LCD head units. (On a personal note, the Polar View offered by the Wattbike PMB is one of the best training tools I‚Äôve ever encountered).</p><p>Carol splits this difference by offering a 10.1-inch color touchscreen that offers the same sort of data you‚Äôd find on an LCD set, but cleaner and more colorful. The UI flashes an angry red when you hit the high intensity phase, and the visualizations showing your power output are great. A software update, too, came through during my review that has made the UI a lot cleaner and smoother than it was before. And, even better, you can use the display to live stream classes from Peloton‚Äôs own app, although you‚Äôll need to subscribe to them separately.</p><p>Boot the bike up for the first time and you‚Äôll be greeted by a Lenovo splash screen because Carol‚Äôs display is quite literally a Lenovo tablet in a housing. On paper, this is genius: An Android tablet should last longer, is more affordable and should be easier to replace than a custom solution. Plus, you can (and Carol does) leverage Google‚Äôs pre-built accessibility features for adjusting screen fonts and voice overs that it would take time and money to copy for little-to-no upside.</p><p>Not to mention that, because it is an Android tablet, you can run third-party apps through the Play Store, albeit only ones that have been sanctioned by Carol‚Äôs makers. So far, that‚Äôs just Peloton, but there‚Äôs no technical reason that your favorite fitness, or entertainment, app couldn‚Äôt wind up on this screen as well. But, for all of those positives, slamming an Android tablet onto a bike and calling it quits still feels a bit lackluster for a bike costing <em>two thousand four hundred dollars</em>.</p><h2><strong>In use</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b397dec0-281d-11ec-bfd5-ee1fd9ad9221" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="b521abd9-909d-35ee-bc18-12f43e2b2c4e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>Once you‚Äôve answered the medical questionnaire, you have to go through six taster sessions for the bike to gauge your overall fitness level. After that point, you‚Äôre free to sample the delights that the bike has to offer, including four different REHIIT workouts. I pretty much stuck to the standard program ‚Äî the reason anyone would buy a Carol bike ‚Äî but there are other options available. This includes an Energiser ride, which offers shorter, 10-second sprints, as well as  15-minute or 25 minute Fat Burn program, with 30 or 60 sprints, respectively. You also get the option for a Free Ride, with power controlled by yourself, or an Endurance ride with the resistance slowly ramping up beyond your ability to cope with it.</p><p>Once you‚Äôve chosen a program, you‚Äôre asked to choose from a series of generic audio options but, again, I was advised by the company‚Äôs representatives to stick with the default. (This was probably for the best, because the other options are essentially musak.) In it, a calm voiceover talks about how neanderthal man never jogged, they either walked slowly, or ran like their lives depended on it. At the same time, the on-screen coaching tells you to breathe in for four seconds, hold for a beat, and then exhale over six seconds, which is hard to coordinate if you‚Äôre bad at multitasking. All the while you‚Äôre asked to cycle at a very low level, never exceeding an output of 20 watts or so.</p><p>There‚Äôs a countdown timer on screen (and a timeline), so it‚Äôs not as if you‚Äôre not told when the sprints are about to begin. But the narration treats it more like a surprise, talking about the vista when, suddenly, she tells you that there‚Äôs a tiger leaping out at you!, and you have to pedal for your life. The screen turns red three seconds before the sprint begins, letting you spool up as you prepare to go hell for leather to escape your predator. Because the resistance is calibrated to your fitness level, it continues to go up after your initial burst of energy to ensure that you‚Äôre nicely wiped out by the end of the sprint. Hell, I found that I was flagging at the 10-second mark, and could never get back to my first output peak no matter what I tried.</p><p>You may scoff at the idea that biking for just 20 seconds can wipe you out and make any positive impact on your fitness. You begin to feel your legs go as your body suddenly starts to wuss out, and the final quarter of the sprints have you running on fumes. As effective exercises go, the system makes good upon its promises, and you need that long recovery time to restore any sense of humanity you may have had. The screen will graph your output (and compare it to your output on the second sprint, when you hit it) and let you see how far you‚Äôve dropped between runs. Although the on-screen display‚Äôs promise that you won‚Äôt sweat is mostly true, it‚Äôs not entirely fair for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bosch-freshup-clothes-refreshing-ionizing-wand-140044262.html">sweaty, sweaty</a> boys like me.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b39805d0-281d-11ec-a7fb-09ae8e411682" alt="Images of the CAROL HIIT bike" data-uuid="be0a9a3f-86f9-3479-8915-dad110ae8fd6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>In the period in which I was using Carol, I think my fitness did improve, as did my mood when I was trying to complete one of these more or less every single day. (The bike repeatedly advises you, as does its representatives, to only do a single sprint session in a 24 hour period and only three times a week to avoid injury.) You certainly start the day feeling more energized, and I can‚Äôt complain that this has eaten a big chunk of my day when it hasn‚Äôt.</p><p>But I‚Äôm finding myself hamstrung by the price, especially given the fact that it‚Äôs designed to do one job, one fitness program, to the exclusion of most others. Do I want to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:spend $2,399" href="https://fave.co/3oKmJD6">spend $2,399</a> plus an additional $12 a month on an appliance I‚Äôd use for 30 or 40 minutes a week? Yes, that‚Äôs less than you can spend on a <a href="https://wattbike.com/us/product/atom-2017">Wattbike Atom</a> or Peloton Bike+, but it‚Äôs still a lot. In that philistinic sense of knowing the cost of something but not its value, the numbers make my eyes water.</p><p>It‚Äôs a bike that does one thing, really, and it does it well, but I feel in my gut that I‚Äôd have an easier time singing this thing‚Äôs praises if its price was<em> just</em> below the $2,000 mark. It‚Äôs a weird psychological barrier for sure, and maybe you‚Äôre scoffing at my imaginary parsimony. But as much as this thing is designed for a mainstream audience, right now, it‚Äôs priced at the level where only enthusiasts can buy it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/carol-rehiit-smart-exercise-bike-142103038.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8a8fcf49-003a-46da-9460-23aeecf99914</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 14:21:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633716783</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T18:13:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cycling]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/77e8a260-281d-11ec-b7ef-7753c22c8a9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/77e8a260-281d-11ec-b7ef-7753c22c8a9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the CAROL REHIIT Smart Bike.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Carol Bike ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best outdoor gear for the fall]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The weather is starting to get cooler, but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs time to head indoors for winter just yet.

All you have to do these days is find a decent tuning app or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-02-the-best-commands-for-google-home.html">ask Google Assistant</a> to tune your instrument. Now Google has made the process even more painless by launching a chromatic tuner right within Search. The tech giant has told <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/google-search-has-an-instrument-tuner/"><em>Android Police</em></a> that it has just rolled out the new Search feature, which can be accessed on pretty much any device.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the Assistant function that needs, well, a device that can access the voice assistant, you can summon this tuner simply by doing a query in Search on mobile or desktop. Just type in &quot;google tuner&quot; to see it right on top of the results page. Of course, the device you&#39;re using must have a functional microphone to be able to hear your instrument, and you&#39;ll need to give the feature permission to access it.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This is what the tuner looks like on desktop:</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b7b17a20-2827-11ec-96fd-bfae5de50bee" style="height:683;width:800;" alt="Google" data-uuid="3c0e681e-5f57-3746-a6de-6b726bd98fed"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>According to <em>Android Police</em>, its effectiveness depends on the microphone of your device. Some devices might need you to play loudly or really, really close to them, and smartphones might work better than computers for this particular purpose. After you get it to work, the tuner will let you know whether your instrument is in tune or if you need to adjust it with the help of a visual indicator. This built-in Google tuner joins other music-related features in the tech giant&#39;s search engine, including &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-search-hum-to-search-song-ai-200947045.html">Hum to Search</a>,&quot; which can help you identify songs stuck in your head.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-guitar-tuner-search-113540630.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">68d21344-b098-4b3c-9921-33b94602591f</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 11:35:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633692405</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T11:26:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5cd4a950-2823-11ec-b72f-1ea7d205c85f" width="6019" height="4013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5cd4a950-2823-11ec-b72f-1ea7d205c85f" width="6019" height="4013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Klaus Vedfelt via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Vlogger making making video at home in stylish urban apartment]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Female influencer recording for video blog with guitar lesson]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The Internet Archive imagines a grim future of the internet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Browsing the internet has gotten better in many ways.

AMD has <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400">published</a> documentation on a couple of Windows 11 bugs affecting its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-ryzen-5000g-cpu-153020975.html">Ryzen</a> processors, one of which can slow down its CPUs by up to 15 percent. That particular bug can increase L3 cache latency by three times, which in turn can affect apps that need quick access to memory.&nbsp;</p><p>Most affected applications could slow down by three to five percent. If you play games &quot;commonly used for eSports,&quot; though, you might be feeling the bug&#39;s impact a lot more, since it could slow down those games by around 10 to 15 percent. The second bug, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/10/windows-11-bug-could-reduce-ryzen-cpu-performance-by-up-to-15-amd-says/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> explains, is related to the &quot;preferred core&quot; feature that allows a system to use the fastest individual CPU cores in a processor.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>AMD didn&#39;t mention any particular percentage for the second bug, but the company said its impact is more noticeable in chips with more than eight cores and with 65W Thermal Design Power (TDP) or higher. That includes many of the high-end desktop chips released over the past few years, but suggests popular lines like the 3600X and 5600X should be minimally affected, and AMD-powered laptops aren&#39;t likely to be particularly troubled either.&nbsp;</p><p>In its announcement, AMD assured that it&#39;s investigating the issues with Microsoft and that they&#39;re working on a fix for them. A patch for the first bug will be released as Windows update, while a fix for the second will roll out as a software update sometime this month. For the latter, it could mean having to check <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400">AMD&#39;s website</a> for the update and having to install new drivers manually.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amd-windows-11-bug-ryzen-100550246.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1a7e8fd7-fb02-463d-8f57-f4e77ad02b98</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 10:05:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633689832</ingested><modified>2021-10-08T10:43:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c9bc6f80-2805-11ec-b3fc-57f59cbf6f98" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c9bc6f80-2805-11ec-b3fc-57f59cbf6f98" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[nantonov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Moscow, Russia - October, 2020: AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Processor close up in the black motherboard CPU socket.

The project, done in collaboration with Michigan State University (MSU), has welcomed its first 100 students aged 18 to 60 for a 10-month &quot;comprehensive app development and entrepreneurial training&quot; program, Apple wrote in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-opens-developer-academy-in-detroit-to-create-new-career-opportunities/">newsroom post</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The custom-designed space is located in the First National Building in downtown Detroit.

Elon Musk has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/business/tesla-texas-headquarters.html">announced</a> the move at the company&#39;s most recent annual shareholder meeting, where he also clarified that Tesla still plans to expand production at its California plant by 50 percent. He explained, however, that there&#39;s &quot;a limit to how big you can scale in the Bay Area,&quot; because house prices are sky high, which means long commutes for workers who have to live elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p>The move doesn&#39;t come entirely as a surprise: Musk previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-mask-requirement-nevada-battery-factory-210035322.html">threatened</a> to move Tesla&#39;s headquarters out of California after coronavirus <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-restarts-production-211807400.html">lockdowns</a> forced the company to suspend production in the state. He even called the lockdown orders &quot;fascist&quot; during an earnings call in 2020 and then personally relocated from LA to Austin a few months later. That said, it&#39;s worth noting that Tesla is now based in a state where it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-affected-by-texas-dealership-laws-152618312.html">can&#39;t sell</a> its cars to buyers directly, which has been its approach from the beginning, due to pro-dealership laws.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/07/tesla-moves-its-headquarters-from-california-to-texas.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> notes, Musk moving to Texas means he&#39;d be paying less taxes. The state has no personal income tax, whereas California has some of the largest income tax rates in the country. Further, the state has been offering companies tax breaks to build facilities in the state under the Texas Economic Development Act.</p><p>During the meeting, shareholders also voted on proposals to improve company governance. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/business/tesla-texas-headquarters.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> said they agreed on most of the proposals aside from a couple that the company opposed, one of which would require the company to publish reports on its efforts to diversify its workplace. Tesla said in a <a href="https://www.tesla.com/sites/default/files/downloads/2020-DEI-impact-report.pdf">report</a> (PDF) last year that its leadership in the US is still mostly white and male, while its workforce is 79 percent male and 34 percent white overall. Just a few days ago, the company was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-must-pay-ex-worker-137-million-in-discrimination-lawsuit-075729021.html">ordered</a> to pay $137 million in damages to a former Black worker.

The company took the internals of its well-liked <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-15-micro-four-thirds-future-interview.html"><ins>Micro Four Thirds</ins></a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5s-irl-for-4k-review-videos-120034054.html"><ins>GH5S</ins></a> and rehoused them in a body better suited for video production workloads. Almost exactly one year later, Panasonic has announced the <a href="https://www.panasonic.com/uk/consumer/cameras-camcorders/lumix-mirrorless-cameras/lumix-box-style-cameras/dc-bs1h.html">DC-BS1H</a>. Like its predecessor, this latest release from the company takes an existing Panasonic camera, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-panasonic-s1h-review.html"><ins>full-frame S1H</ins></a>, and puts it in a new body.</p><p>At the heart of the BS1H is a 24.2-megapixel CMOS sensor that can capture footage at up to a 6K resolution. Specifically, it‚Äôs capable of recording 6K video at up to 24 frames per second, 5.4K at 30 frames per second with a 3:2 crop and 5.9K at 30 frames per second with a 16:9 framing. Panasonic claims the BS1H‚Äôs sensor features more than 14 stops of dynamic range and the inclusion of both an optical low pass filter a Dual Native ISO feature help reduce moire and digital noise.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But if you‚Äôre looking at a box-style camera for yourself, you want one for the added connectivity options the format promises. On the front, the BS1H is no slouch. Notably, it includes a USB 3.1 Type-C connection, an HDMI Type-A port and a 3G serial digital interface. It‚Äôs also possible to connect 12 BS1H cameras together to create a multi-camera setup. Additionally, you‚Äôll find the usual assortment of 3.5mm and XLR microphone connections, on top of a LAN port. Oh, and it comes with dual SD card slots for worry-free redundancy.</p><p>Panasonic will sell the DC-BS1H for $3,500 when it becomes available in November.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-dc-bs1h-annoucement-222351349.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a913b3d4-22e3-431e-b12d-6dbccb5808a6</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 22:23:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633644426</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T22:07:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d0dfdb00-27b8-11ec-b76f-e12eb17b578a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d0dfdb00-27b8-11ec-b76f-e12eb17b578a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Panasonic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Panasonic DC-BS1H]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Panasonic DC-BS1H]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube blocks ads on climate change denial videos]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-anti-vaccine-video-ban-channel-takedowns-134545387.html">reduced tolerance for misinformation</a> now extends to climate science. The Google service has <a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321">enacted</a> a new policy barring ads and monetization for content that contradicts the &quot;well-established scientific consensus&quot; surrounding climate change, including videos that claim climate change is a hoax or reject the human link to global warming. YouTube will start enforcing the policy in November.</p><p>The company stressed that it would allow ads for videos discussing those bogus claims as well as other climate-related subjects, such as the exact degree of human impact or debates on climate policy. YouTube is basing its judgments on &quot;authoritative&quot; expertise, including contributors to the UN&#39;s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The firm wasn&#39;t shy about the reasoning for the move: advertisers just don&#39;t want their ads linked to climate change denial material, and creators don&#39;t want those ads on their pages.

Unlike anti-vaccine misinformation, climate change denial doesn&#39;t carry the risk of short-term harm. YouTube can keep the content visible for the sake of debate and expression without worrying that it will directly lead to illness. This won&#39;t stop science deniers from moving to other platforms or using their videos to peddle products like books, but it might discourage &#39;casual&#39; attempts to profit from climate misinformation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-bans-ads-on-climate-change-denial-videos-213242793.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fe55efed-aad2-45d5-927b-64384ffbe145</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 21:32:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633640990</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T21:10:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/895a1de0-27ae-11ec-9e7f-7808bb9bca88" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/895a1de0-27ae-11ec-9e7f-7808bb9bca88" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PAUL ELLIS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Climate activists hold a banner after climbing atop the roof of the entrance of the building and others line the pavement at ground level as they protest outside the UK office of Youtube during the tenth day of demonstrations by the climate change action group Extinction Rebellion, in London, on October 16, 2019. - Activists from the environmental campaign group Extinction Rebellion vowed Wednesday to challenge a blanket protest ban imposed by the London police.

To start, the company is <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/129769858/updates-to-captions-and-audio-features-on-youtube?hl=en">testing</a> the option of adding multiple audio tracks to videos. This will help with international viewers, of course, but it should also enable descriptive audio for people with little to no vision. This arrives sometime in the &quot;coming quarters,&quot; YouTube said.</p><p>Automatic captions should also be far more commonplace. YouTube now permits live automatic captions for any livestream in English, not just those with 1,000 or more subscribers. These live captions will be available for all 13 supported auto-captioning languages in the &quot;coming months,&quot; according to the company. Auto-translated captions will also reach supported languages on Android and iOS later in 2021, so you won&#39;t have to turn to your PC to make sense of a video you don&#39;t understand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>An experiment later in 2021 will let you search transcripts on your phone, YouTube added. A previously promised subtitle editor is still on track to launch in the &quot;coming months,&quot; giving creators the chance to delegate subtitle creation to someone they trust.</p><p>The upgrades make sense. YouTube is increasingly dependent on a global audience for views, particularly with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/drlupo-youtube-gaming-exclusive-agreement-211213151.html">growth of livestreaming</a>. These tweaks ensure more people can watch, even if a creator doesn&#39;t have the resources to add subtitles themselves.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-auto-live-captions-200127252.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">614aebf5-dd2a-45bc-86e0-d39c78c1a1fd</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 20:01:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633636254</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T19:51:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6fa84020-27a4-11ec-8b7b-ad39a8fb6c74" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6fa84020-27a4-11ec-8b7b-ad39a8fb6c74" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cavan Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Young fat streamer on a room with multicolor lights]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Geneva International Motor Show is canceled for a third straight year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 2022 Geneva International Motor Show (GIMS) <a href="https://www.gims.swiss/news/geneva-international-motor-show-postpones-create-more-impactful-event-2023">won‚Äôt go forward</a> due to the coronavirus pandemic.

Pre-pandemic, it was one of the largest car shows in the world. It would usually attract more than 600,000 visitors, including some 10,000 journalists, to Swizterland.

The Square Enix-owned studio has <a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/news/eidos-montreal-and-eidos-sherbrooke-shifting-to-the-4-day-work-week/">announced</a> that its Quebec locations (Montreal and Sherbrooke) are shifting to a four-day, Monday-to-Thursday work week sometime in the &quot;next few weeks.&quot; Salaries and working conditions will remain the same, the <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Tomb Raider</em> developer said.</p><p>The hope, as you might expect, is to improve the quality of working hours. Eidos is accordingly encouraging teams to redefine work conditions and improve efficiency, such as by cutting meeting times. The company had already implemented some quality-of-life changes during the pandemic, such as rest periods and compensation for mental and physical health costs ‚Äî this is ostensibly a logical extension of that strategy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Eidos isn&#39;t the first studio to adopt a four-day week. <em>Bugsnax</em> developer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bugsnax-octodad-young-horses-ps5-indie-interview-201014684.html">Young Horses</a> made that switch in September. It&#39;s very rare for a large studio to make this move, though, and it might prompt similar moves by other developers if the strategy proves successful.</p><p>&quot;If&quot; is the operative term, however. Eidos was eager to tout past tests with shortened work weeks, like with Iceland&#39;s civil service, but it&#39;s not yet clear if that translates to the game industry. Developers are notorious for rushing games to make the holiday season, even if that leads to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-08-ubisoft-patch-4-will-fix-most-assassins-creed-unity-bugs.html">extremely buggy results</a>.  Eidos will have to make a hard choice: does it stick to the four-day schedule and risk delaying games, or demand extra hours to be sure a title is ready? This shortened week could pay off with happier developers, but it could also cause problems if teams take months more to finish projects.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/eidos-montreal-sherbrooke-4-day-work-week-184509137.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">215385d2-3aa7-4d8a-9c84-13bf0d83f871</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 07 Oct 2021 18:45:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633632313</ingested><modified>2021-10-07T18:45:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2018-12/a6967d50-f8cb-11e8-9edf-671f5eba7a4a" width="3882" height="2553" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-12/a6967d50-f8cb-11e8-9edf-671f5eba7a4a" width="3882" height="2553" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[FREDERIC J.
