Tag Heuer announced today that it&#39;s collaborating with Nintendo to make a <em>Super Mario</em> edition of its Connected smartwatch, featuring &quot;the intrepid, iconic hero&quot; in various watch faces and animations. It&#39;ll be available July 15th for $2,150, which is in line with how much the Connected series has cost in the past. One of the highlights here, though, is the company&#39;s use of Mario&#39;s appearances to encourage wearers to get active and reward them when they move.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Tag Heuer, Mario&#39;s &quot;upbeat and active personality will encourage wearers of this smartwatch to enjoy moving too.&quot; But it&#39;s not just about being inspired by simply seeing his face on your wrist. The watch&#39;s dial will become &quot;livelier and more animated the more the wearer is active.&quot; There&#39;s also a &quot;gamification rewards system&quot; at play. Mario will greet you with a salute each morning, and as you move about, you&#39;ll get different animations as you hit 25, 50, 75 and 100 percent of your steps target. These animations feature familiar items from the Mario universe, like the Super Mushroom, Pipe, Super Star and Goal Pole. The company says this idea was inspired by the notion of &quot;easter eggs,&quot; so I suppose you&#39;re supposed to treat these animations as such.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Even when you&#39;re not being active, the Tag Heuer Connected Super Mario edition&#39;s interface will remind you of the character. You can choose from a selection of four new watch faces, and they don&#39;t just offer red-and-blue themes. The Timekeeping dial, for example, uses &quot;retro elements from the 1985 version of Super Mario Bros. with Mario, all in pixels.&quot; One of the designs features Mario&#39;s cap, while another takes elements of the game and puts them in a rotating animation.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cbe5a4a0-e347-11eb-9fef-3e317055ea60" alt="Five of the Tag Heuer Connected Limited Edition Super Mario watches with black-and-red straps.

Push buttons, crown logo and bezel graduation now come in Super Mario red, and you&#39;ll find symbols etched into the bezel that reflect the in-game objects you&#39;ll see when you hit your steps goals, too. A letter M is engraved on strap buckles and the crown, while the words &quot;TAG Heuer x Super Mario Limited Edition&quot; are also carved into the back of the watch. The company is also offering two interchangeable straps for the new watch: a black leather band on red rubber and a &quot;sporty alternative in matching red perforated rubber,&quot; as well as a travel case in — what else — Super Mario red.</p><p>Those hardware touches are pretty important since even though the Mario faces and skins will be available first on this limited edition of the Connected watch, Tag Heuer said it &quot;is also considering making it available on other editions of TAG Heuer Connected at a later stage.&quot;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="96716338-6e4f-463a-a8a2-cb38bbb5f085"/><p>Since this is a Wear OS device (Tag Heuer hasn&#39;t responded to Engadget&#39;s query on whether this is the existing OS or if it will update to the version co-engineered by Samsung and Google), the rest of the watch&#39;s functions will feel familiar. You can access Google Assistant, get your calendar and weather updates, along with Fit progress tracking on the watch. It&#39;ll also offer the company&#39;s own Sport, Golf and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag-heuer-unveils-a-wellness-app-for-its-connected-watch-102205216.html">Wellness</a> apps for better fitness tools.&nbsp;</p><p>The Super Mario version of Connected has a 45mm face and weighs 86 grams (0.18 pounds) with a rubber strap. It&#39;s water resistant up to 5ATM, and Tag Heuer promises its 430mAh battery can last a full day.&nbsp;</p><p>Tag Heuer is only making 2,000 of these watches, which will be available in selected boutiques and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:at its website" href="https://fave.co/2T5JdkF">at its website</a><a href="http://www.tagheuer.com/"></a>in some regions, from 15th July 2021.

But instead of findings computers, the agency found racks with thousands of PS4 Pros stacked vertically side-by-side. As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/thousands-of-ps4-pros-discovered-in-warehouse-raid-1847272415"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, the Ukrainian authorities confiscated over 5,000 gaming-related devices — 3,800 of which were consoles — from a warehouse right next to (and formerly owned by) the Vinnytsiaoblenergo energy distribution company.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;s the largest cryptofarm the SBU has discovered so far, and the agency believes it&#39;s being operated by people living in the cities of Kyiv and Vinnytsia. Apparently, the operators used special electricity meters to prevent authorities from discovering the theft, which amounted to as much as US$257,000. &quot;At the same time,&quot; the SBU wrote in its announcement, &quot;the illegal withdrawal of electricity could lead to more global consequences — entire neighborhoods of Vinnytsia could be left without electricity.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Vinnytsiaoblenergo denied any involvement in a statement sent to the <a href="https://www.kyivpost.com/technology/security-service-uncovers-crypto-mining-farm-in-vinnytsia-allegedly-stealing-electricity.html"><em>Kyiv Post</em></a>: &quot;The equipment used for cryptocurrency mining has never operated on premises owned by our enterprise.&quot; It also said that it didn&#39;t find any evidence of electric theft and that the SBU&#39;s findings &quot;does not correspond to reality.&quot; While it&#39;s unclear at the moment whether the facility truly stole electricity or not, the SBU has published images of the  PS4 Pros it found at the warehouse, which you can see below. As <em>Kotaku</em> notes, 3,800 consoles mean an investment of around US$1,500,000, assuming all of them are PS4 Pros.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9dded1f0-e395-11eb-a3fe-b61df0dcd37a" style="height:1066;width:1600;" alt="CREATOR: gd-jpeg v1.0 (using IJG JPEG v62), quality = 90

The retailer has discounted the laptop by $80, marking one of the first times we’ve seen it on sale since it came out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-2021-chromebook-lineup-134546625.html"><ins>earlier in the year</ins></a>. With the discount, the Spin 713 is currently $619 instead of $699. The model that Best Buy is selling features an 11th-generation Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It also comes with plenty of ports, including two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 connections, a microSD slot, as well as HDMI and headphone jacks.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/doL5G3">Buy Acer Chromebook Spin 713 at Best Buy - $619</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Engadget gave the Spin 713 a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html"><ins>score of 85</ins></a> when we reviewed it last month. Part of what makes it stand out in the crowded Chrome OS market is that it features a display with a 3:2 aspect ratio. Most Chromebooks feature 16:9 displays, making them well-suited for watching video content but less than ideal if you need to do any work on them. The display on the Spin 713 is also bright and sharp with a pixel density of 200 pixels per inch. The taller screen also means you get a more generous trackpad than you’ll find on your average Chromebook. Combine that with a solid keyboard, a capable processor and just the right amount of RAM for Chrome OS and you have a device that’s solid. Aside from average battery life, one of the few complaints we had with the Spin 713 was the asking price. At $619, it&#39;s a better value.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-best-buy-deal-221524448.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bea7f764-11f3-4e7c-a9a3-8f165d597ff2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 22:15:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626128127</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T22:15:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/28c55b10-cd37-11eb-9c7d-c457511f17df" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/28c55b10-cd37-11eb-9c7d-c457511f17df" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 713]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 713]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Verizon settles with Huawei over patent disagreement]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Huawei and Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) have settled their long-standing patent dispute. The disagreement dates back to 2019 when Huawei said it approached Verizon about licensing some of its technologies. After nearly a year of negotiations, talks between the two companies broke down on January 21st, 2020, and Huawei went on to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-06-huawei-verizon-patent-lawsuit.html">file multiple lawsuits against the telecom in courts across Texas</a>. At the center of the feud were 12 standards-relevant patents that Huawei said Verizon was using in its infrastructure. At the time, Verizon dismissed the lawsuits, claiming they were “nothing more than a PR stunt.”</p><p>It has since changed its tune. “Verizon is happy with the settlement reached with Huawei involving patent lawsuits. While terms of the settlement are not being disclosed, our team did an outstanding job bringing this protracted matter to a close,” Verizon spokesperson Rich Young <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-statement-huawei-litigation-settlement"><ins>said in a statement</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For Huawei, this is precisely the type of outcome the company had hoped for when it announced at the start of 2021 that it planned to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-5g-patent-licensing-184450343.html">monetize its patent portfolio more aggressively</a>. While the US and other parts of the world have barred it from their national 5G networks, the Chinese company is ideally situated to make money on licensing fees. It has among the most 5G-related standards-relevant patents of any company in the world. To that end, it estimated the licensing strategy could help it generate as much as $1.3 billion in additional revenue between 2019 and the end of 2021.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/huawei-verizon-patent-settlement-205915191.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fe42ff38-1e0a-4ec5-b905-69497069a867</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 20:59:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626123558</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T20:59:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/79281300-ca61-11eb-93d6-a1edda9f485c" width="5568" height="3132" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/79281300-ca61-11eb-93d6-a1edda9f485c" width="5568" height="3132" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HJBC via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boulogne-Billancourt, France - June 6, 2020: French headquarters of Huawei Technologies, chinese multinational company which designs, develops, and sells telecommunications equipment and smartphones.

Spanish crime drama <em>Money Heist</em> has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html"><ins>been a massive hit</ins></a>, while French thriller <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q4-2020-211411926.html"><em><ins>Lupin</ins></em></a> is Netflix&#39;s most successful original series so far this year. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spriggan-trailer-2022-release-date-231200486.html">Anime</a> and Korean dramas are also <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2021/06/18/lupin-international-tv/"><ins>growing in popularity</ins></a> among subscribers. Earlier this year, Netflix <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/netflix-anna-k-leo-tolstoy-anna-karenina-first-russian-original-svetlana-khodchenkova-1234764255/">picked up</a> a modern-day adaptation of <em>Anna Karenina</em> as its first original drama series in Russian.</p><p>It&#39;s not too surprising that Apple is looking at a similar approach to content. Apple TV+ only has a few non-English-language projects available to stream, including <em>Tehran</em> and <em>Losing Alice</em>, so there&#39;s a lot of scope for Apple to expand its library with Russian and multilingual shows.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-russian-language-multilingual-shows-alexander-rodnyansky-ar-content-155904970.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a19c0eb-4d12-4597-b899-e5b77e5cf215</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 15:59:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626105549</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T15:59:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/68d77600-e328-11eb-bcfd-5f370f2bdacb" width="3500" height="2341" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/68d77600-e328-11eb-bcfd-5f370f2bdacb" width="3500" height="2341" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mario Anzuoni / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Producer Alexander Rodnyansky of the movie "Leviathan," nominated for an Academy Award for Foreign Language Film, poses for a portrait in Los Angeles, California February 3, 2015.

Virgin Galactic told the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-has-a-ticket-to-space-too-with-richard-bransons-virgin-11626012705">statement</a> that Musk bought a ticket aboard the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html">air-launched rockets</a>. It&#39;s not certain just where the SpaceX founder is in the queue, but it&#39;s safe to say his ride will garner some attention.</p><p>The feeling is mutual. In an <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/richard-bransons-space-flight-is-about-to-win-the-billionaire-race-to-the-stars-3pw8zvfwh">interview</a> with the <em>Sunday Times</em>, Branson said Musk was a &quot;friend&quot; and suggested he might fly on a SpaceX ship &quot;one day.&quot; He even went so far as to <a href="https://twitter.com/richardbranson/status/1414199651037716485">tweet</a> a photo showing him and Musk together.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Just don&#39;t expect that kind of warmth and camaraderie from Jeff Bezos. Blue Origin was more than a little eager to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html">trash-talk Virgin</a> ahead of its first fully crewed spaceflight, claiming that Branson and team were merely brushing the edge of space. While the company later wished Branson a &quot;great flight,&quot; we wouldn&#39;t expect Bezos and Branson to have heart-to-heart coffee chats any time soon.</p><p>It&#39;s not a complete shock that Branson and Musk would be so cozy. However well their personalities mesh, the two aren&#39;t quite direct competitors. Virgin Galactic is aimed primarily at space tourists content with suborbital flights, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-orbit-live-launch-stream-123903068.html">Virgin Orbit</a> is focused on launching satellites for outfits that can&#39;t justify expensive conventional rockets. SpaceX, meanwhile, has focused its tourism efforts on lunar flybys and usually carries costlier payloads into space. This isn&#39;t to say the two execs will start feuding if their businesses truly overlap — just don&#39;t count on the positive vibes lasting forever.</p><div id="590fcca69a3240fd8f4b317c0328c9f9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Big day ahead.

Verizon (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/verizon-media-sale-yahoo-apollo-funds-122155517.html">currently</a> Engadget&#39;s parent company) might have a solution. It&#39;s <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-neighborhood-spoofing-scams">updating</a> its free Call Filter app with a &quot;Neighborhood Filter&quot; that blocks calls from numbers that share your area code and prefix.

And yes, you can make exceptions. Any number in your contact list or allowed numbers will still get through, and you can correct an accidental block by telling the app to ignore the filter for future calls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The updated app is available now for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.vzw.ecid">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/verizon-call-filter/id777875529">iOS</a>. Neighborhood filtering isn&#39;t the most sophisticated defense against scam calls, but it&#39;s arguably overdue.

A simple filter could lead to far fewer annoyances, not to mention greater trust in those calls that do come in.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/verizon-call-filter-neighborhood-spoofing-142918590.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0f8db3a2-3dc3-4fd9-8c8a-fb8ef18ca46d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 14:29:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626100160</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T14:29:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9115a580-e317-11eb-bfac-e5e6b7860112" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9115a580-e317-11eb-bfac-e5e6b7860112" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Verizon logo is seen displayed on a phone screen in this illustration photo taken in Poland on November 19, 2020.

Regulators have thrown down the gauntlet for local companies by announcing new privacy rules for those seeking foreign stock market listings, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-widens-clampdown-overseas-listings-with-pre-ipo-review-firms-with-large-2021-07-10/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. As a result, any company that has data on more than a million customers must face a review into how they handle that info in order to receive permission for a foreign IPO.&nbsp;</p><p>Regulators will scrutinize the risks of said data being being affected, controlled or manipulated by external governments following overseas flotations. In a broader effort to get companies to list locally, China is adding the two sets of rules that focus on data collection and data storage to its Data Security Law and the Personal Information Protection Law.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The constraints arrive in the midst of a privacy crackdown by Beijing. Regulators have previously rattled their sabres at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-says-tiktok-bytedance-linkedin-misuing-dada-133448710.html">TikTok and LinkedIn</a> for alleged data collection violations.

They&#39;re even more tempting when you consider the latest discount. The active noise cancelling earbuds are currently on sale for an all-time low price of $120 at Amazon-owned Woot. That&#39;s $80 off their typical price and $20 less than the previous record deal.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Galaxy Buds Pro at Woot - $120" href="https://fave.co/3k4pUDz">Buy Galaxy Buds Pro at Woot - $120</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Maybe it&#39;s because the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review.html">Galaxy Buds+</a> landed in February and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-unpacked-line-up-revealed-in-huge-new-leak-095533534.html">Buds 2</a> are expected in August. Whatever the reasons behind the latest price cut, the Buds Pro are still worthy of your cash due to their bombastic sound. Firstly, unlike the $150 Buds+, they boast active noise cancellation and a wider audio range that features more depth and clarity thanks to the internal 1mm woofer and a 6.5mm tweeter.&nbsp;</p><p>Voice calls have also been improved with the help of three microphones, an accelerometer and Wind Shield tech for when you&#39;re outdoors. What&#39;s more, battery life matches Samsung&#39;s estimates at five hours with ANC and Bixby turned on and eight hours with them off, or 28 hours total with the case — which supports wireless charging. For those looking for durability, the IPX7-rating means you can dunk them in up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes. Overall, they&#39;re still our highest rated Samsung earbuds with an exemplary review score of 85.&nbsp;</p><p>Just note that before you purchase them it may be worth familiarizing yourself with Woot&#39;s terms and conditions. For the uninitiated, the online retailer mainly offers limited-time deals with a modified return policy to its parent Amazon that includes numerous exceptions, including charges for shipping costs.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-all-time-low-122528401.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cac21999-0026-4046-bf24-e44044e4b09b</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:25:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626089386</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T11:30:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/35316a10-e303-11eb-acee-8b317f57a73a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/35316a10-e303-11eb-acee-8b317f57a73a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Galaxy Buds Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Galaxy Buds Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[MIT robot could help people with limited mobility dress themselves]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Robots have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-11-30-mind-controlled-telepresence-robot.html">plenty of potential</a> to help people with limited mobility, including models that could help the infirm put on clothes. That&#39;s a particularly challenging task, however, that requires dexterity, safety and speed. Now, scientists at MIT CSAIL have developed an algorithm that strikes a balance by allowing for non-harmful impacts rather than not permitting any impacts at all as before.&nbsp;</p><p>Humans are hardwired to accommodate and adjust to other humans, but robots have to learn all that from scratch. For example, it&#39;s relatively easy for a person to help someone else dress, as we know instinctively where to hold the clothing item, how people can bend their arms, how cloth reacts and more. However, robots have to be programmed with all that information.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="2aafa51cf73346e498eb0f7a1065b79d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-9JrDMBg2HE?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>In the past, algorithms have prevented robots from making any impact with humans at all in the interest of safety. However, that can lead to something called the &quot;freezing robot&quot; problem, where the robot essentially stops moving and can&#39;t accomplish the task it set out to do.&nbsp;</p><p>To get past that issue, an MIT CSAIL team led by PhD student Shen Li developed an algorithm that redefines robotic motion safety by allowing for &quot;safe impacts&quot; on top of collision avoidance. This lets the robot make non-harmful contact with a human to achieve its task, as long as its impact on the human is low.</p><p>&quot;Developing algorithms to prevent physical harm without unnecessarily impacting the task efficiency is a critical challenge,&quot; said Li. &quot;By allowing robots to make non-harmful impact with humans, our method can find efficient robot trajectories to dress the human with a safety guarantee.&quot;</p><p>For a simple dressing task, the system worked even if the person was doing other activities like checking a phone, as shown in the video above. It does that by combining multiple models for different situations, rather than relying on a single model as before. &quot;This multifaceted approach combines set theory, human-aware safety constraints, human motion prediction and feedback control for safe human-robot interaction,&quot; said Carnegie Mellon University&#39;s Zackory Erickson.</p><p>The research is still in the early stages, but the ideas could be used areas other than just dressing. &quot;This research could potentially be applied to a wide variety of assistive robotics scenarios, towards the ultimate goal of enabling robots to provide safer physical assistance to people with disabilities,&quot; Erickson said.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-csail-unveils-a-robot-that-helps-the-infirmed-dress-themselves-120016438.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">150237df-ad42-4411-9fee-574701281407</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 12:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626087445</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T10:57:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/85a7c910-e2f6-11eb-aeff-7248bac689f6" width="1800" height="1123" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/85a7c910-e2f6-11eb-aeff-7248bac689f6" width="1800" height="1123" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL unveils a robot that helps the infirmed dress themselves]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL unveils a robot that helps the infirmed dress themselves ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Finally, Virgin Galactic completes its first crewed spaceflight]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After oh so many delays, training up its founder, Sir Richard Branson, and some delightful, sometimes petty, banter with Blue Origin (love those “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html https://www.engadget.com/...">largest windows in space</a>” claims), Virgin Galactic has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-spaceflight-complete-154012847.html https://www.engadget.com/...">made it into space.</a></p><p>Or at least, it did, depending on who you ask.

The <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-firms-to-buy-covid-19-vaccines-on-behalf-of-taiwans-government-11626020496">reports</a> that the two companies have agreed to buy 10 million Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine doses on behalf of Taiwan&#39;s government. The two are purchasing the shots from Fosun Pharmaceutical, the vaccine&#39;s exclusive distributor across the Greater China region, after China allegedly &quot;spiked&quot; Taiwan&#39;s bid to directly buy the vaccine.</p><p>There was pressure to make a deal. Taiwan has largely kept COVID-19 levels low throughout the pandemic, but new cases started surging in late April and prompted rare restrictions on the island. While infections are dropping, Taiwan has only vaccinated about 14 percent of its population. It will need many more doses if it&#39;s going to lift restrictions while keeping cases low.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Tech companies like have offered to buy vaccines for employees and contractors before. Apple helped TSMC buy vaccines for its staff, for instance. A purchase this large for the general population breaks new ground, however — the companies are buying enough doses to inject over 40 percent of Taiwan&#39;s 24 million people.</p><p>Foxconn and TSMC have strong incentives to step in. Outbreaks could hurt their operations, even for those factories and other facilities beyond Taiwan. That could be particularly dangerous amid a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-macbook-assembly-delayed-global-chip-shortage-115005064.html">global chip shortage</a> and other manufacturing headaches — mass infections and shutdowns could cause further snarls. A vaccine purchase like this could save the companies money in the long run.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/foxconn-tsmc-taiwan-vaccines-204926440.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">40764321-f1de-4998-9388-7c2ff1f357d9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 11 Jul 2021 20:49:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626080271</ingested><modified>2021-07-12T08:58:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5a6ba070-e286-11eb-b3fc-35ba6a069404" width="4647" height="3098" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/5a6ba070-e286-11eb-b3fc-35ba6a069404" width="4647" height="3098" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Elderly people and other citizens wait for vaccination against the Coronavirus at a vaccination centre, following an outbreak with a surge in the number of domestic infections and deaths, in Taipei, Taiwan, 5 July 2021.
