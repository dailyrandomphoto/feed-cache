The video game company has <a href="https://activisionblizzard.com/content/atvi/activisionblizzard/ab-touchui/ab/web/en/newsroom/2021/10/creating-a-more-accountable-workplace.html">published</a> the letter Executive VP for Corporate Affairs Fran Townsend sent to employees revealing the move, in which she also said that more than 20 other individuals faced different types of disciplinary action. Back in July, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html">filed a lawsuit</a> against the developer for allowing a work environment wherein female employees were allegedly subjected to constant sexual harassment.</p><p>The agency, which sued the company after a two-year investigation, detailed several of its findings in the lawsuit. It said female employees constantly have to fend off unwanted sexual comments, and that they have to endure being groped by male colleagues. They&#39;re also not paid as much as their male counterparts,  are typically promoted more slowly and fired more quickly. At the time, Townsend told employees that the lawsuit &quot;presented a distorted&quot; picture of the company and that it included &quot;factually incorrect, old and out of context stories.&quot; Hundreds of employees walked out in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employee-open-letter-221223475.html">protest</a> over the company&#39;s response.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Now, in her letter, Townsend said that there&#39;s a team dedicated to investigating harassment claims, &quot;working tirelessly to ensure that, moving forward, [the company] is a place where people are not only heard, but empowered.&quot; The team received an increasing number of reports in recent months, including concerns from years ago, and it was the members&#39; investigation that led to the exit of more than 20 employees. Townsend declined to name those individuals, but she told <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/7cb805b9-4d14-40ee-a1f2-72bc3c3e1ea6"><em>Financial Times</em></a> that they include several game developers and a few supervisors. None of them came from senior management or from the board.&nbsp;</p><p>A <a href="https://kotaku.com/jesse-mcree-diablo-4-director-no-longer-at-activision-1847469113"><em>Kotaku</em></a> report from August <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-loses-designers-121905544.html">named</a> three senior designers who abruptly exited the company. Two of them — <em>Diablo 4</em> lead designer Jesse McCree and <em>World of Warcraft</em> designer Jonathan LeCraft — were previously pictured inside the Cosby Suite. In its lawsuit, DEFH said the Cosby Suite is a room with a photo of Bill Cosby where male employees allegedly harassed women during company events.</p><p>To be able to handle more complaints, Activision Blizzard hired three full-time employees to join the investigation team. It&#39;s also adding 19 more full-time roles to its overall Ethics &amp; Compliance Team, two of which will be dedicated to overseeing investigations for the EMEA and APAC regions. Townsend admitted that the team can&#39;t always share the details of an investigation, but she also promised more transparency &quot;We know there’s a desire to know about the outcome when misconduct is reported. Sometimes, there are privacy reasons we can’t share. But where we can, we will be sharing more information with you. We will also be providing you regular aggregate data about investigative outcomes,&quot; she wrote in her letter.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-fired-20-employees-harassment-cases-112540361.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">786bf980-e5bb-41d0-871c-cfb464a03e11</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 11:35:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634728107</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T11:08:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f0ef7ae0-f54f-11eb-bf39-1896212cf0e2" width="5000" height="3263" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f0ef7ae0-f54f-11eb-bf39-1896212cf0e2" width="5000" height="3263" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DAVID MCNEW via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Employees of the video game company, Activision Blizzard, hold a walkout and protest rally to denounce the companys response to a California Department of Fair Employment and Housing lawsuit and to call for changes in conditions for women and other marginalized groups, in , in Irvine, California, on July 28, 2021.  (Photo by DAVID MCNEW / AFP) (Photo by DAVID MCNEW/AFP via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US-IT-GAMES-SEXISM-ACTIVISION]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro first impressions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google’s Pixel 6 family is officially priced and will launch on October 28th, available to pre-order today.

Again. But will Google finally be able to get its phones in people’s hands? The company glimpsed success with its very competitively priced Pixel 3a, briefly edging out OnePlus in phone sales for a hot second. Then the Pixel 4 and Pixel 5 failed to repeat the success at tougher prices. Notably, the $600 Pixel 6 is $100 cheaper than last year&#39;s Pixel 5, but it looks to be a far better phone.</p><p>Each phone has a thick camera bar stretching across the back. The Pixel 6 has a dual-camera system, with wide and ultrawide lenses, while the Pixel 6 Pro adds a telephoto option. On both devices, the primary camera is a 50-megapixel sensor with a quad-bayer filter, which puts four pixels behind each standard color block — you’re not going to get 50-megapixel photos here, but something more in the realm of 12.5 megapixels. The Pixel 6 Pro’s telephoto camera is a 48-megapixel sensor with 4x optical zoom. There are no invisible front-facing cameras — or notches — but a pin-hole camera on both Pixels. There is also an under-screen thumbprint sensor for the first time in a Pixel phone.

But there are a lot of new things to tackle with the Pixel 6 series. This series has the company’s first “pro” phone, some Android 12-exclusive tricks and significant voice recognition enhancements — if you’re in the US.</p><p>The two phones differ slightly in design, which marks a departure from previous years. Instead of the matte soft-touch texture of older Pixels, both Pixel 6 phones have glass-covered sides,   creating a premium feel. According to Cherlynn Low, they’re a little blockier and feel more like a Samsung device — which may not be a bad thing.</p><p>Both phones are also much larger than the Pixel 5, and though their screen sizes differ, they have almost the same footprint. But the main feature improvement in the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is their cameras, and this is what Cherlynn (and I) are most excited about. For now, she could only gather some impressions while under the supervision of Google reps, but expect her own review to put all the cameras through their paces. As Cherlynn will admit herself, she loves a selfie camera opp.</p><h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-hands-on-tensor-features-camera-specs-available-price-170038272.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></h3><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pass-subscription-170056831.html">The Pixel Pass bundles a Pixel 6 with Google services for $45 per month</a></h2><h3>All the Google you’d ever need.</h3><h3></h3><p>Google has an answer to the Apple One bundle, and it includes a new phone.

As part of that probe, it said Facebook couldn&#39;t continue with activities related to the merger (integrating products, merging teams and so on) without prior approval from the CMA.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the CMA has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cma-fines-facebook-over-enforcement-order-breach">announced</a> that it has fined Facebook £50.5 million ($70 million) for breaching those enforcement orders. &quot;This is the first time a company has been found by the CMA to have breached an [order] by consciously refusing to report all the required information,&quot; the CMA said in a press release.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The authority said that Facebook &quot;significantly limited the scope of&quot; updates required by the CMA, despite repeated warnings. Citing criticism by the Competition Appeal Tribunal and Court of Appeal, it noted that Facebook engaged in &quot;what might be regarded as a high-risk strategy&quot; around a &quot;lack of cooperation&quot; with the CMA.</p><p>In response to the fine, a Facebook spokesperson gave the following statement: &quot;We strongly disagree with the CMA’s unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. We will review the CMA’s decision and consider our options.&quot;</p><p>The CMA said it also fined the company £500,000 ($700,000) for changing its Chief Compliance Officers twice without seeking consent.

The deal represents a win for International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) workers, who have typically been <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/iatse-hard-line-film-tv-contract-talks-amptp-1234800346/">paid less</a> for streaming shows than theatrical film productions and broadcast TV series in the US.</p><p>In an informational brief, IATSE tweeted that wages will increase for long-form, episodic and mini-series at up to 30 percent, depending on the classification. Those boosts depend on the size of the streaming company, with rates higher for services with 20 million or more subscribers. Longform productions between $20 and $32 million used to get discounts if they were headed to streaming services, but that will no longer be the case.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="42b43d8fd4f44a069cac9b788fe5b5ea"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW: We are releasing our first three one page documents explaining how the new tentative Basic Agreement addresses the priorities members identified early in the bargaining process.<br><br>This is a non-exhaustive set of member priorities, more soon.<br><br>1.

He said that while the company is &quot;deeply committed to inclusion,&quot; it&#39;s equally committed to &quot;supporting artistic freedom with the creators who work at Netflix.&quot; He added that Netflix would not add a disclaimer in front of the special as employees requested, reasoning that Chappelle himself gives a warning at the beginning.&nbsp;</p><p>Sarandos also addressed the issue of transparency in the company after an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-fires-employee-trans-leader-dave-chapelle-leak-204706894.html">employee was fired</a> for leaking internal company documents showing viewer figures for Netflix shows, including Chappelle&#39;s previous special. &quot;We’re deeply committed to the culture of transparency,&quot; he told <em>THR</em>. &quot;And it also depends upon a great deal of trust with our employees that we continue to secure, but we don’t plan on changing any of our internal operations around that.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-ceo-says-he-screwed-up-internal-communication-over-dave-chappelle-special-080412118.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">38d5c08d-dcec-4a4f-9808-cb98e96bc373</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 08:04:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634717054</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T08:04:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13476990-3173-11ec-af4f-56e641bd9a60" width="4000" height="2665" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/13476990-3173-11ec-af4f-56e641bd9a60" width="4000" height="2665" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ROBYN BECK via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Netflix logo is seen on the Netflix, Inc. building on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, California on October 19, 2021. - Netflix reported billion-dollar profits and booming subscriber growth on October 19 that beat forecasts as global hits like Squid Game drew viewers in droves.

The social network itself will likely retain the Facebook branding and will be under a new parent company, along with Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus.

There’s a lot to unpack between the two phones, but the most important thing you need to know about them is that they’ll start at $599 and $899. In the case of the Pixel 6, that means it’s $100 cheaper than last year’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">Pixel 5</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Headline features shared by both phones include Google’s eight-core <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-soc-pixel-6-chip-170059466.html"><ins>Tensor processor</ins></a>, a fresh new design, a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-6-camera-will-feature-larger-image-sensors-and-smarter-photo-editing-ai-171159356.html"><ins>rear camera array</ins></a> that includes a 50-megapixel main sensor and new security features courtesy of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-12-pixel-3-rollout-170031989.html"><ins>Android 12</ins></a> and the company’s Titan M2 chip. To that package the Pixel 6 Pro adds a 6.7-inch “waterfall” display with a dynamic 120Hz refresh rate, 12GB of RAM and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera with 4x optical zoom. With both phones, Google says you can expect more than 24 hours of usage on a single charge.</p><p>Both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are available to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-smartphones-173051481.html"><ins>pre-order today</ins></a>, with general availability to follow on October 28th.

The agency issued a <a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-22473.pdf">proposal</a> to create a category of approved devices that people would be able to buy without a prescription, hearing exam or having to arrange a fitting with an audiologist.</p><p>&quot;The proposed rule is designed to help increase competition in the market while also ensuring the safety and effectiveness of OTC and prescription hearing aids,&quot; <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-issues-landmark-proposal-improve-access-hearing-aid-technology-millions-americans">the FDA said</a>. Around 15 percent of adult Americans (some 37.5 million) have hearing difficulties, according to the agency.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The FDA&#39;s goal is to make it easier for those who could benefit from hearing aids to actually get one — it says only a fifth of people who fall into that category use such a device. The agency is hoping to tackle some of the barriers people might encounter, including cost, ease of access, social stigma and state and federal regulations.</p><p>In 2017, the federal government passed the Over-the-Counter Hearing Aid Act with the aim of improving access to more affordable hearing aids. Hearing aids have only available with a prescription as the FDA classed them as Class I or II medical devices. President Joe Biden <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">signed an executive order</a> in July that, in part, instructed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to publish a proposed rule for OTC hearing aids within 120 days.</p><p>The proposal is now open to a 90-day public comment period. If and when the rule is finalized, it will come into effect 60 days after it&#39;s published in the federal register.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-15-upgrade-your-hearing-with-technology.html">Several companies</a> have already made moves to gain a foothold in the OTC hearing aid market. Earlier this year, Bose <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aids-152746656.html">started selling</a> its SoundControl hearing aids after gaining approval from the FDA, while Jabra unveiled its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-enhance-plus-earbuds-130001782.html">Enhance Plus earbuds</a> a couple of months ago. Other companies are blending hardware and tech in hearing aids, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-08-bragi-project-ears-hearing-aids-tinnitus.html">Bragi</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-olive-union-smart-ear-hands-on.html">Olive Union</a>.</p><p>Apple, meanwhile, recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-conversation-boost-feature-175701382.html">updated AirPods Pro</a> with a feature that amplifies the volume of other people&#39;s voices in conversation while reducing ambient noise. The company is also said to be looking into ways of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-health-device-leak-132037664.html">using AirPods as health devices</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fda-over-the-counter-hearing-aids-proposed-rule-190444627.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3e8a311e-ef0e-4a50-a3a4-83ecc6d70536</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 19:04:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634670287</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T19:04:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government Agencies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/796a7690-fb5e-11eb-bf57-dac88e198d8b" width="6048" height="4032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/796a7690-fb5e-11eb-bf57-dac88e198d8b" width="6048" height="4032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AlexRaths via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Doctor inserting hearing aid in man's ear]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hearing Aid]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google turns those annoying call center menus into easy-to-navigate screens]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In addition to the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-hands-on-tensor-features-camera-specs-available-price-170038272.html">Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro</a>, Google also released more details about new capabilities that its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-soc-pixel-6-chip-170059466.html">Tensor chip</a> enables. One of them is a much more intelligent way of handling those calls to businesses that sometimes have you waiting hours on end just to speak to a representative. Now, the Pixel will show you the current and projected wait times before you even place a call so you can call when it works for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, when you do call and encounter an endless list of options (like, &quot;Press 1 for branch location and hours&quot; if you&#39;re calling a bank), you don&#39;t need to remember all of them carefully.

Instead of having to stay on the line, Google Assistant will remain on the call for you. It understands the difference between a recorded message and an actual representative on the line.

The company showed off new security hub and privacy dashboard features that will make it easier to control important settings.</p><p>The security hub provides an at-a-glance overview of security settings, such as whether or not your phone has the latest security updates installed or if you’ve set a fingerprint or PIN to unlock your device. Importantly, it can also keep tabs on the apps you’ve installed and can identify ones that are potentially “harmful.” At the top of the security hub is an indicator that will alert users if any settings need attention. A green checkmark indicates all is well, while a yellow exclamation mark will appear if something needs to be addressed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google also showed off new indicators to make it easier to tell when an app is using the phone’s camera or microphone feeds. Much like the notifications in iOS, an indicator will light up at the top right corner of the display when the phone’s mic or camera feeds are in use, and users will have the ability to kill access for specific apps.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9896fec0-3106-11ec-bee7-ae7e0964532b" style="height:964;width:822;" alt="pixel 6 privacy dashboard" data-uuid="38a688f6-5f22-34f3-b054-6395e6a5215a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Likewise, the new privacy dashboard makes it easier to track which data apps have access to and how each app is using its permissions to access information like location data. As with the security hub, Google has previously made much of this information available within Android already, but it was often buried several layers into the settings menu, so having it all in a single dashboard should make it easier for most users to find.</p><p>Google also said it’s beefed up its anti-spam and phishing protection features, and Pixel 6 will be able to provide warnings when it detects potential shady phone calls, texts, emails and links.</p><p>It’s not yet clear if or when the company plans to bring these features to more devices than just its Pixel lineup. The company said during its event that the privacy dashboard and security hub would be “coming first” to Pixel, so the features could eventually make their way to more Android devices in the future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pixel-6-security-hub-privacy-dashboard-180603530.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">76298033-6311-46d0-bbc1-096552b91d78</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 18:06:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634666764</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T18:06:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a20a1c70-3102-11ec-9dff-6025448e758a" width="1746" height="1002" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a20a1c70-3102-11ec-9dff-6025448e758a" width="1746" height="1002" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Pixel 6 Security Hub.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[pixel 6 security hub]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Quick Tap to Snap is a Pixel 6-first camera shortcut for Snapchat]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In addition to camera features like Magic Eraser, Google&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-price-specs-release-date-170039729-170024290.html">Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</a> phones will have something special for Snapchat users.

But securing an exclusive Snapchat feature, even if it&#39;s only a timed one, is still a big win for Google. A lot of Snapchat users, <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/surprise-teens-love-snapchat-apple">many of whom are teens</a>, prefer the iPhone for the simple reason that the app works best on iOS.

The league might just loosen its stance in the future, though. As <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734293/mlb-streaming-service-local-games-launch">reports</a>, <em>New York Post</em><a href="https://nypost.com/2021/10/17/mlb-in-talks-to-launch-nationwide-streaming-service-for-home-games/">sources</a> claim MLB is in &quot;talks&quot; to launch a national streaming service that would offer home games without requiring cable. While details aren&#39;t finalized, it would cost between $10 to $20 per month depending on the market. The NBA and NHL are even &quot;considering&quot; partnerships, according to the sources.</p><p>If it goes ahead, the service would launch as soon as the 2023 season. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-08-youtube-tv-will-soon-include-mlb-s-streaming-service.html">MLB.tv</a> would still be available for those who don&#39;t mind out-of-market games. A deal is &quot;not yet close at hand,&quot; so it wouldn&#39;t be surprising if talks fell apart. An MLB spokesperson declined to comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The pitch would be simple, according to the insiders: MLB sees this as a service for young baseball fans who are either cord-cutters or never subscribed to cable in the first place. Viewership and in-person attendance have both dropped sharply (12 percent and 34 percent respectively) since 2019, and the pandemic wasn&#39;t entirely to blame. This could shore up numbers and keep baseball relevant for an audience that would rather not pay $100-plus for cable just to root for the home team.</p><p>There&#39;s little doubt this would be a gamble, though. Sports channels and cable providers are highly protective of their broadcast rights, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sinclair-broadcast-group-ransomware-attack-154239001.html">Sinclair</a> alone owns the digital rights for 14 of 30 teams. Sinclair reportedly asked to run the service for &quot;several years&quot; before MLB shot it down. While MLB is in a strong-enough position to reject Sinclair&#39;s overtures, it could face a backlash from cable companies that would pay less to air games.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mlb-home-game-streaming-service-174132524.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">afa1358c-4a3c-487f-a2a4-890a7a6558de</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 17:41:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634665294</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T06:03:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Baseball]]></category><category><![CDATA[Major League Baseball]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/460a8870-30fc-11ec-bab2-08c4f2d6f16d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/460a8870-30fc-11ec-bab2-08c4f2d6f16d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Owen Lystrup on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Colorado Rockies play baseball at Coors Field in Denver]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Colorado Rockies play baseball at Coors Field in Denver]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to pre-order the Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google finally revealed the long awaited (and much rumored) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-hands-on-tensor-features-camera-specs-available-price-170038272.html">Pixel 6 smartphones</a> today.

The handset also has Google&#39;s Titan M2 security chip for enhanced security, along with camera and mic toggles.</p><p>When it comes to cameras, the Pixel 6 has a 50MP wide lens and a 12MP ultra wide shoot on the back, plus an 8MP front-facing camera. The rear setup can shoot video in up to 4K/60fps while the front camera tops out at 1080p/30fps. Google added a bunch of new camera features to the smartphone, too, including Magic Eraser, which automatically suggests objects like random people or cars to remove from a shot, Face Unblur and Motion Mode.</p><p>Inside the Pixel 6 is Google&#39;s Tensor processor, 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage.

The key differences between the Pixel 6 Pro and the regular Pixel 6 are in battery size and cameras. The 6 Pro has a slightly larger battery, but Google gives the same battery life estimations for both handsets. Both also support fast charging and wireless charging.</p><p>The Pixel 6 Pro has one extra rear camera: a 48MP telephoto shooter that supports super-res zoom up to 20x. That&#39;s on top of the 50MP wide camera and the 12MP ultra wide lenses that also appear on the regular Pixel 6. The 6 Pro also has a slightly better front-facing camera, which is a 11MP shooter with a wider, 94-degree field of view.</p><p>The Pixel 6 Pro has all of the same security features that its smaller counterpart does, including the under-display fingerprint sensor. It also runs on the same processor but comes with 12GB of RAM — storage options remain the same, too.</p><p><em>Catch up on all the latest news from </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Pixel%206%20event"><em>Google&#39;s Pixel 6 event</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-smartphones-173051481.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c543f59-43ed-4719-afd3-ffaa6370b737</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 17:30:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634664932</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T17:35:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/547861b0-305d-11ec-bddf-c85f95fd1b12" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/547861b0-305d-11ec-bddf-c85f95fd1b12" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Pixel 6 Pro vs. the competition: Telephoto, Tensor and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year&#39;s Pixel came and went with only one screen size available, and for this year&#39;s flagship Google&#39;s giving you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-price-specs-release-date-170039729-170024290.html">two options again</a>.

chip goes up to bat]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year&#39;s Pixel phone might have been unambitious, but <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-price-specs-release-date-170039729-170024290.html">this year&#39;s pair</a> look to be a real treat. Google&#39;s finally got its own chip, the Tensor, alongside the Titan M2 coprocessor for better security. (Given the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html">Pegasus spyware incident</a> this summer, it&#39;s a welcome and well-timed addition.) There&#39;s plenty of new software features, like Live Translate and Material You, the latter of which will allow you to customize your home screen&#39;s look even more. But this past year has been a pretty decent year for phones, and below you can see how the Pixel 6&#39;s new gussied-up insides compare to some of the other stellar flagships we&#39;ve seen in 2021.

sensors and smarter photo editing AI]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Pixel 6 smartphone has finally been unveiled. On Tuesday, Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/meet-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro/">explained</a> what sorts of cameras and image capture systems the new handsets will offer when they go on sale October 28th.&nbsp;</p><p>Both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro will come equipped with a 50-megapixel Octa PD Quad Bayer wide camera (the base 6 will additionally feature 7x Super Res Zoom) as well as a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera. Their new 1/1.3 inch rear sensors reportedly capture up to 150 percent more light than the Pixel 5. The 6 Pro will also sport a 48-megapixel telephoto camera with 4x optical and 20x Super Res Zoom functionality. Around front, the base 6 will offer an 8-megapixel camera while the 6 Pro gets a 12-megapixel camera.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both models can capture video in 1080p and 4K (at either 30 or 60 FPS) with their rear cameras, as well as 240 FPS slo-mo. The 6 Pro&#39;s front camera can record at both 1080p (30 and 60 FPS) or in 4K at 30 FPS. The base 6&#39;s front however can only record at 1080p resolution at 30 FPS.</p><p>Editing photos should be a much more streamlined process than with past models, thanks to the Pixel 6&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html">Tensor</a> SOC integration. Users will be able to leverage the <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/magic-eraser/">Magic Eraser</a> which can quickly and seamlessly remove random objects and even people from the background of shots. What&#39;s really cool is that Magic Eraser will work on any photo you have, whether you just captured it using the Pixel 6 or dug it out of your Google Photos archive. The system will automatically recommend distractions to remove from your shots, though you can just as easily manually circle items that you want erased.&nbsp;</p><p>Another cool feature is Face Unblurring. The camera is already automatically scanning for faces in the scene you&#39;re pointing it at, using Face SSD (single-shot detector). If it detects one that is blurry, the Pixel will activate a second camera so that you&#39;ll actually take two photos with the press of the shutter button — a short exposure from from the ultra-wide and a standard exposure from the main. Machine learning then stitches the sharper face captured by the ultra-wide onto the image captured by the main to create a clear hybrid image.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pixel 6 can also intentionally increase blur through Motion Mode (using the same basic technique as Face Unblur but working in reverse) by first taking multiple shots of a scene, then identifying the subject of the photo via machine learning and computational photography techniques and applying aesthetic blurring effects to the parts that are in motion, while keeping the static aspects crisp and sharp. Best of all, these features will extend to any first- or third-party app that relies on the Pixel 6&#39;s camera, such as Snapchat.</p><p><em>Catch up on all the latest news from </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Pixel%206%20event"><em>Google&#39;s Pixel 6 event</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pixel-6-camera-will-feature-larger-image-sensors-and-smarter-photo-editing-ai-171159356.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a95b2d19-d041-4f82-9181-b7acfea28f9d</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 17:11:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634665798</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T17:50:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c5fda190-30ff-11ec-bff7-6bcd36986021" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c5fda190-30ff-11ec-bff7-6bcd36986021" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[pixel 6]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[pixel 6]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
