Amazon is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/sustainability/amazon-backs-new-companies-focused-on-low-carbon-technology">investing in three companies</a> working on creating sustainable technology as part of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-invests-2-billion-clean-energy-fund-183049118.html">its $2 billion Climate Pledge Fund</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The first of these companies is Resilient Power, a company working to make delivering electricity from the power grid and delivering it to electric vehicle charging stations more efficient. The company appears primarily focused on fleets — think businesses that need to deploy vehicles en masse, like shipping services — rather than individual vehicles. The company claims it can build out EV fast-charging stations at one-tenth the standard size and installation time as current stations. Naturally, an efficient, fast-charging solution for fleets of delivery vehicles is something&nbsp;that could be directly relevant to Amazon. It also could relate to the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-15-amazon-rivian-investment-electric-pickup-truck-suv.html">existing investment in EV maker Rivian</a>, which could plausibly make EVs for Amazon delivery services down the line.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The second company, CMC Machinery, can design and manufacture custom-fit boxes for whatever items need to go inside, without waste like extra space and single-use padding materials. Again, the benefit to Amazon is obvious here — if the company is going to continue to ship things at the rate it currently does, reducing the amount of packaging waste the company produces would be significant.</p><p>Finally, a company called Infinium is working on renewable fuel technology as an alternative to traditional diesel and jet fuels. The company claims its Infinium Electrofuels are &quot;ultra-low carbon fuels that can be used in air transport, marine freight, and heavy truck fleets.&quot; This marks Amazon&#39;s second investment round in Infinium, and it&#39;ll be used to help develop facilities for producing the company&#39;s fuel. Amazon also says that this investment will help the company actually deliver its fuel for the first time, which would be a pretty major milestone.&nbsp;</p><p>With these three new companies, Amazon is now supporting 11 total companies with its Climate Change Pledge, a key component in its plan to eliminate net carbon emissions by 2040. Given that goal, it makes sense that these investments are in companies that can directly help Amazon reduce its carbon footprint. With COP26 about to start, both Apple and Microsoft have also made announcements around moves they&#39;re making to become more eco-friendly. Apple, which plans to be carbon-neutral by 2030, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-announces-new-climate-initiatives-ahead-of-cop-26-climate-conference-131617869.html">announced</a> it has &quot;more than doubled&quot; the number of suppliers committed to using clean energy. Microsoft, meanwhile,  is hoping to reduce data center water consumption by 95 percent by 2024, just a few short years from now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-climate-pledge-fund-2021-investments-142723838.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">51e56d35-cdde-404a-ae67-b39b16b5c501</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 14:27:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635344845</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T14:27:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/621f0cd0-3731-11ec-bfff-3cb1433e2e9a" width="5123" height="3415" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/621f0cd0-3731-11ec-bfff-3cb1433e2e9a" width="5123" height="3415" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Harvey Gonzalez via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An Amazon Prime delivery van sits idle beside a yellow Amazon Locker drop box where customers can collect their online deliveries on 10th August, 2021 in Leeds, United Kingdom.

Today, it is pushing out a trio of true <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:wireless buds" href="https://fave.co/3vRcwqb">wireless buds</a> for folks who want to look sporty and stylish without compromising on quality.&nbsp;</p><p>The flagship is the Z.N.E. 01 ANC, a pair of active noise-cancelling buds with swappable ear tips and subtle, three-stripes branding. You’ll get 20 hours of life from a charge, with 4.5 in the buds and an additional 15.5 hours in the case.

These don’t pack the custom ear tips, but what it lacks in style and features, it makes up for in battery life: 5 hours in each bud, and a further 20 in the case itself.</p><p>Rounding out the trio is the FWD-02 Sport, a pair of running-friendly buds with swappable ear tips and wings, a force sensor, so you can control it while wearing gloves, and IPX5 rating to defend against sweat and rain. These, too, will run six hours in your ear, with the charging case providing an additional 19 hours of juice before you need to head back to an outlet.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Z.N.E. 01 and 01 ANC" href="https://fave.co/3vRcwqb">Z.N.E. 01 and 01 ANC</a> are available to order now, priced at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$189" href="https://fave.co/2ZrzNCK">$189</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$99" href="https://fave.co/3bcuw4S">$99</a>, respectively, while the FWD-02 Sport can be pre-ordered today for $169, and will start shipping at some point in November.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adidas-tws-zne01-anc-fwd02-sport-140056623.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f17ce62b-e527-4633-9e54-79886d473e86</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 14:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635343747</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T14:09:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65808300-364f-11ec-9e7b-07a8a2cfaad6" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/65808300-364f-11ec-9e7b-07a8a2cfaad6" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adidas / Zound]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the new Adidas TWS]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Adidas True Wireless]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[MIT will deploy robotic boats in Amsterdam that can carry five passengers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>MIT&#39;s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) is ready to deploy the autonomous passenger boat it&#39;s been developing over the past six years. The vehicle, called the <a href="https://roboat.org/">Roboat</a>, has been through multiple iterations — just last year, the lab <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mit-autonomous-roboat-ii-carries-passengers-140145138.html">tested</a> a version that can carry two passengers. This year, Roboat&#39;s creators are launching its full-scale version, which can carry up to five passengers, collect waste and deliver goods, in Amsterdam.&nbsp;</p><p>The current Roboat has futuristic looks with its black and grey design and two seats facing each other. It&#39;s fully electric with 10 hours of battery life on a single charge and has wireless charging capabilities. MIT CSAIL Director Daniela Rus says it&#39;s more precise and has more robust perception, navigation and control systems that its predecessors. It also comes with new features, including close proximity approach mode that makes docking to a port or connecting to another boat easier, as well as better dynamic positioning that will help it better navigate real-world waters.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The vehicle&#39;s autonomous driving technology is similar to ones used by self-driving cars, according to CSAIL, and operates by using GPS to decide on a safe route from point A to point B. Roboat also uses LIDAR and several cameras to enable a 360-degree view that gives it a way to determine its path and avoid crashing into obstacles. The vehicle can operate on its own round-the-clock, but an onshore operator will monitor it remotely from a control center: A single operator will be able to monitor up to 50 Roboat units.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Roboats will debut on October 28th in the waters of Amsterdam. Stephan van Dijk, Director of Innovation at Amsterdam Institute for Advanced Metropolitan Solutions, said: &quot;The historic centre of Amsterdam is the perfect place to start, with its capillary network of canals suffering from contemporary challenges, such as mobility and logistics.&quot;</p><div id="2b0248f41aea4a2b83f7049e1c46a045"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BlQxrqhpN9c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-roboat-deployment-amsterdam-140024326.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7c3d186-0119-422f-998c-dcb0a704d282</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 14:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635341269</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T13:27:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/26899070-3725-11ec-8fcd-00dc67684009" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/26899070-3725-11ec-8fcd-00dc67684009" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT CSAIL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MIT Roboat]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MIT Roboat]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LinkedIn's new job filters make it easier to find remote work]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LinkedIn is introducing dedicated remote, hybrid and on-site search filters to help users on their next job hunt.

It&#39;s unveiling the initiatives ahead of COP26, the upcoming UN conference that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/27/cop26-climate-talks-will-not-fulfil-aims-of-paris-agreement-key-players-warn">many observers feel</a> will not produce the breakthroughs needed to achieve aims set at the Paris climate accord.</p><p>As part of its 2020 <a href="https://www.apple.com/environment/pdf/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2020.pdf">environmental progress report</a>, Apple said that its products and supply chain would be carbon neutral by 2030. That includes not just Apple itself, but 175 supplies that also need to transition to renewable energy, it wrote today. When that happens, &quot;the company and its suppliers will bring online more than 9 gigawatts of clean power around the world,&quot; avoiding over 18 million metric tons of CO2e annually, Apple wrote.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>In total, 175 Apple suppliers will transition to using renewable energy, and the company and its suppliers will bring online more than 9 gigawatts of clean power around the world. These actions will avoid over 18 million metric tons of CO2e annually — the equivalent of taking over 4 million cars off the road each year.</p></blockquote><p>Apple noted that 19 suppliers in Europe are now part of its Clean Energy Program, including Solvay and STMicroelectronics. It has 50 more in China, along with 31 in Japan and South Korea, including SK Hynix, &quot;one of the first Korean suppliers to participate.&quot; Its also creating &quot;new pathways&quot; for recycled materials, including recycled sources of gold, cobalt, aluminum and rare earth elements.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple also added 10 new projects for its &quot;Power for Impact&quot; initiative designed to bring clean energy solutions to communities around the world, particularly in under-resourced communities. That includes a project with six Sioux tribes in the US to finance, develop, build and operating power generation facilities, along with renewable energy projects in South Africa, the Philippines, Columbia, Israel and elsewhere.</p><p>While Apple appears to be making good on its promise to deliver products built with 100 percent clean energy, it continues to take heat over e-waste and related right to repair issues. Many of its products are difficult and expensive to repair, meaning that they either end up as e-waste or recycled toward new products. Both of those things use energy, clean or otherwise, that wouldn&#39;t be consumed if the product was simply fixed.</p><p>Recently, President Biden ordered the FTC to draft <a href="https://www.engadget.com/president-biden-right-to-repair-executive-order-211328084.html">right to repair</a> legislation, and Europe announced that it would take measures forcing phone manufacturers to use USB-C — both rules that seem to primarily target Apple.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-announces-new-climate-initiatives-ahead-of-cop-26-climate-conference-131617869.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99b4c397-d7e2-4138-970a-da4833d9f051</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:16:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635343470</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T14:04:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0cf5f2a0-3727-11ec-a9ed-85db23d6fc59" width="1960" height="1306" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0cf5f2a0-3727-11ec-a9ed-85db23d6fc59" width="1960" height="1306" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple announces new climate initiatives ahead of the COP26 climate conference]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple announces new climate initiatives ahead of the COP26 climate conference]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Uber will rent up to 50,000 Tesla EVs to drivers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s now clear why Hertz is buying a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hertz-reportedly-orders-100000-teslas-in-the-single-large-ev-purchase-ever-132633765.html">so many Tesla cars</a>. The company is <a href="https://www.uber.com/newsroom/hertztesla/">making</a> up to 50,000 Tesla EVs available for rent solely to Uber ridesharing drivers in the US starting on November 1st.

It should reduce vehicle emissions and expose many people to EVs for the first time, Uber said. However, it could also lower some running costs. Drivers won&#39;t have to pay for fuel, after all, and Uber has incentive programs that offer more money per trip (up to $1.50, if it&#39;s an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-green-us-climate-change-impact-162446386.html">Uber Green</a> ride) to EV operators.</p><p>Uber has strong motivations to adopt EVs.

The firm could burnish its image with eco-friendly cars roaming the streets. Even so, it&#39;s a big deal both for curbing car-based emissions and for EV adoption — 50,000 cars is a large chunk of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-posts-a-wildly-profitable-q3-despite-difficult-car-market-210905631.html">Tesla&#39;s production</a>, and likely one of the largest single-customer EV purchases to date.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uber-rents-tesla-evs-to-drivers-131556170.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3f4446b2-0f2f-4223-b8eb-db27c7f86035</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:15:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635339914</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T13:05:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/31429ba0-3721-11ec-bbf6-78f17eebef36" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/31429ba0-3721-11ec-bbf6-78f17eebef36" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Uber]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3 cars available for rent at Hertz]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla Model 3 cars available for rent at Hertz]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon adds new colors and software features to Echo Frames]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Amazon’s Echo Frames smart glasses first became widely available, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa-glasses-open-ear-speaker-133017197.html"><ins>we found</ins></a> they were capable if somewhat boring.

The company also has a tradition of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-sharp-shot-213047501.html">previewing experimental tools</a> that may make it to the likes of Photoshop and others. As part of its &quot;sneaks&quot; session today, Adobe will demo Project In-Between: an AI-based tool that creates what the company calls &quot;living photos&quot; from separate still images.&nbsp;</p><p>Using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adobe-sensei-ai-sky-replacement-preview-155256593.html">Adobe Sensei AI</a>, the tool makes an animation between two or more photos with a single click. Project In-Between will also let you choose the number of transition frames with a higher number creating faster motion. Once it&#39;s done, you can access the in-between frames individually as well. There is a big caveat though: your images have to be similar. For example, you could use an image of a person smiling and one of them not in the same general pose. If the images are too different, the results get weird quickly as the transitions become more like transformations. Adobe says the feature can also be applied to video to create slow-motion clips.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="bd74c6a8-c75e-4a66-860e-c4fd72b747b5"/><p>Adobe sees Project In-Between as a way to make photos you take on your phone more interesting. The company explains that the results of the tool could be posted as GIFs to social channels and various other places. With that in mind, it will be interesting to see if Adobe can bake this technology into a mobile app so that you can do all of the editing on your phone, and keep the results there for easy posting.&nbsp;</p><p>Adobe has shown off dozens of experimental features over the years at its Max event. In fact, the Sneaks portion of the festivities has become so popular, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-adobe-experimental-sneaks-editing.html">schedules a dedicated session</a> entirely devoted to previews of technology that&#39;s in development. Of course, not all &quot;sneaks&quot; make the leap to full-on features in Creative Cloud apps. However, some of them do, with Photoshop&#39;s powerful <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH0aEp1oDOI">Content Aware Fill</a> perhaps being the most famous example, demoed long before &quot;sneaks&quot; became as popular as they are today.&nbsp;</p><p>You can expect to see a demo of Project In-Between and this year&#39;s other &quot;sneaks&quot; during an Adobe Max session <a href="https://www.adobe.com/max/2021/sessions/na-max-sneaks-with-kenan-thompson-mb130.html">at 12PM ET</a> today.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/201be430-3721-11ec-b7ff-6b89ffaa96eb" alt="Adobe Project In-Between" data-uuid="ac6675d4-2802-3fc5-9455-88127edf9d8d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobe-project-in-between-preview-130017575.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b587f10-fae6-471e-85ac-131cb428eb76</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 13:00:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635338757</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T12:46:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9eab3980-3722-11ec-be5f-3f90f7e9f1a5" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9eab3980-3722-11ec-be5f-3f90f7e9f1a5" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Adobe Project In-Between]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Adobe Project In-Between]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blink security cameras are up to 33 percent off right now]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The holiday shopping season is a good time to invest in smart home gadgets since many are heavily discounted.

The Twitter analytics service has <a href="https://botsentinel.com/newsroom/reports">published</a> a report examining activity on the website related to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and found that around 70 percent of the hateful and negative comments about the couple originated from 83 accounts.

Why? Because there&#39;s no motive. It&#39;s not like the #StopTheSteal movement that aims to overturn the results of the 2020 US Presidential Elections. &quot;Are these people who hate her?

Your guess is as good as ours,&quot; he said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And by &quot;people,&quot; he means actual people. The accounts aren&#39;t bots, but actual users who know how to manipulate the platform&#39;s algorithms. They avoid detection and avoid being banned for violating Twitter&#39;s Terms of Service, for instance, by pairing negative comments about Harry and Meghan with positive ones about William and Kate. &quot;This level of complexity comes from people who know how to do this stuff, who are paid to do this stuff,&quot; Bouzy said.</p><p>Bot Sentinel sampled 114,000 tweets with hashtags and keywords related to the Sussexes, such as  #HarryandMeghan and #MeghanMarkle.

It can be a rice cooker, a slow cooker, a pressure cooker, and some models even let you make yogurt. A few years ago, the company released the Instant Pot Smart WiFi, which let you control it remotely from your phone. Now, there’s a brand new connected model called the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Instant Pot Pro Plus" href="https://fave.co/2XOLCma">Instant Pot Pro Plus</a> (priced at $169.99) that promises to do that, and more.</p><div id="2f939ba599634d37b820b92733f2b8be"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FiPfZaybJZ4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Similar to the Smart WiFi, you can connect the Instant Pot Pro Plus to your phone over WiFi. You can then use the Instant Pot app to start or stop cooking, check the timing and monitor the progress from anywhere in the home. But the Pro Plus can do more than that. The app has over 1,500 “smart” recipes, which have the timing, pressure levels and venting preferences already pre-programmed in, so all you need to do is follow the step-by-step instructions to prepare your meal. Plus, you can release the steam valve remotely and enter in a delayed start time. You can also create your own custom recipe with programmable venting methods (you can choose from natural release, pulse release or quick release).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Instant Pot Pro Plus has other improvements too. For one thing, it has a much sleeker design, with a large and bright LCD screen. The stainless steel inner pot has an extra-thick aluminum layer that promises more efficient heating, and it has a flat bottom that can go on any stove top. It even has “easy grip” handles that make the inner pot easier to maneuver. The Pro Plus features sous-vide, food warmer, sterilizer and cake maker modes as well.&nbsp;</p><p>The Instant Pot Pro Plus is available now from the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Instant Pot website" href="https://fave.co/3pDUbff">Instant Pot website</a>, Amazon and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Williams-Sonoma;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Williams-Sonoma" href="https://fave.co/2XOLCma">Williams-Sonoma</a> for $169.99.

Both US retail giants have stopped selling products from Lorex and Ezviz, while Lowe&#39;s no longer carries products by the former.</p><p>The US government added parent companies Dahua and Hikvision to its economic blacklist in 2019 for their role in the mass surveillance of Uyghur Muslims in the province of Xinjiang.   Human rights groups believe over a million Uyghurs are being <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-22278037"><ins>detained</ins></a> in internment camps, but China continues to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-22/china-denies-uighur-abuse-claims-as-international-pressure-grows"><ins>deny</ins></a> the allegations.

Following proceedings that involved the Justice Department, the FCC found that China Telecom was likely to comply with requests from the Chinese government, and the commission believes there is the chance of the country affecting and disrupting US communications.</p><p>“Promoting national security is an integral part of the Commission’s responsibility to advance the public interest,” the FCC said in a statement. This follows the commission’s actions regarding networking infrastructure from Huawei and ZTE, two companies that bore the brunt of accusations of being threats to national security. The one-time Huawei subsidiary, phone maker <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honor-commerce-department-entity-list-consideration-193403546.html"><ins>Honor</ins></a>, is still waiting to see if it’s going to be labeled similarly.

To aid in that, it linked a <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9109">guide</a> on how to contact a site&#39;s webmaster.&nbsp;</p><p>Until Google starts to actively remove images, we won&#39;t see what criteria it applies for &quot;public interest or newsworthiness.&quot; In general, though, it seems like most images will likely get pulled if a minor or their guardian asks. However, it doesn&#39;t appear that you&#39;ll be able to demand the removal of images of yourself below 18 unless you&#39;re currently under that age, as <em>The Verge</em> has noted.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/googles-under-18-image-search-removal-option-is-now-widely-available-110634356.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02a5b2ca-2b96-4a87-9ee9-fc33b2a976b1</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 27 Oct 2021 11:06:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635332797</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T11:06:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/11c76ea0-1a84-11eb-bfef-701ecbd78495" width="5300" height="3533" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/11c76ea0-1a84-11eb-bfef-701ecbd78495" width="5300" height="3533" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google closeup logo displayed on a phone screen, smartphone on a keyboard is seen in this multiple exposure illustration, the company's symbol is globally recognized.

A gently sloping roofline contrasted against a rising sill line as well as other classic design details are joined by state-of-the-art amenities like retractable exterior door handles to help improve the vehicle&#39;s aerodynamic performance by nearly 12 percent compared to its previous iterations. The entire vehicle is built on Land Rover&#39;s new <a href="https://media.jaguarlandrover.com/news/2021/02/jaguar-land-rover-reimagines-future-modern-luxury-design">MLA-Flex architecture</a> allowing for 11.6 inches of ground clearance and fording through more than 35 inches of water.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe727790-369e-11ec-b57b-89fc7bff4a37" alt="2023 Range Rover" data-uuid="e7e46e5c-1c25-3a3b-a02f-fa6fd846681e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Land Rover</div></figure><p>An electronic air suspension, which debuted on the Range Rover back in 1992, will keep random road divots from detracting from the drive while the new Dynamic Response Pro system will electronically negate body roll during high speed cornering. Coolest of all, the 2023 Range Rover will offer 4-wheel steering, enabling the rear wheels to turn up to 7 degrees to help maintain stability while cornering as well as reducing the Range Rover&#39;s low-speed turning radius to rival that of a Honda Civic.</p><p>In terms of powertrains, the new Range Rover offers a slew of options. The base models will come with a 48V mild-hybrid 3.0L Turbocharged I6 — turning out 395 hp and 406 ft-lbs of torque — standard. Above that, a 523 hp (553 ft-lbs of torque) 4.4L Twin Turbo V8 is available as well. By the time the Range Rover hits US shores in 2023, Land Rover expects to offer it with an optional 434 hp plug-in hybrid engine capable of travelling up to 62 miles on electric power alone using its 38.2 kWh battery. And, come 2024, Land Rover <a href="https://www.carbuyer.co.uk/news/170634/new-electric-range-rover-previewed-in-exclusive-images">has announced</a> plans to offer its flagship with an all-electric drivetrain.&nbsp;</p><p>But the luxury shown off during Tuesday&#39;s livestream comes at a price. A very steep price. The entry level P400 SE starts at $104,000 ($110,000 if you opt for the 7 seater variant) and climes to a whopping $163,500 for the P530 First Edition with the long wheelbase. Preorders for the new Range Rover are already open and deliveries are expected to begin next spring.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-2022-range-rover-will-come-with-both-mild-and-plug-in-hybrid-powertrains-213309560.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">79e6bb5c-1185-4e1a-b11e-8c2393b974f4</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 21:33:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635337130</ingested><modified>2021-10-27T12:19:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/607f8840-371e-11ec-b7d7-e0a3f893e7ec" width="2369" height="1335" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/607f8840-371e-11ec-b7d7-e0a3f893e7ec" width="2369" height="1335" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Land Rover]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The 2023 Range Rover parked on an oceanside turn on a highway.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[2023 Range Rover]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snap, TikTok and YouTube need to do more to protect children, lawmakers say]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Senate Commerce Committee just wrapped up another three-hour <a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/10/protecting-kids-online-snapchat-tiktok-and-youtube">hearing</a> about social media’s effect on children and teens. But the latest hearing was different from previous ones in an important way: it featured representatives from TikTok, Youtube and Snap.</p><p>Though the three apps are some of the most popular apps among teens and younger users, all three have gotten less attention from lawmakers than Facebook and even Twitter. It was the first time TikTok and Snap had appeared at such a hearing. All three companies tried to head off criticism by drawing distinctions between their platforms and Facebook, which has recently drawn comparisons <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html">to tobacco companies</a>. And each company  promised new features to ramp up parental controls and other child protections on their service.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>YouTube VP Leslie Miller said the company was working on a new feature that would allow parents to “choose a locked default autoplay setting” in the YouTube Kids app, in addition to other new parental controls. She didn’t provide further detail, but said it would launch “in the coming months.”</p><p>Snap also said it was working on new features for parents, with Jennifer Stout, the company’s VP of Global Public Policy, saying the features would be “rolling out very soon.” She said the update would allow parents to view information about how their children are using Snapchat, such as who they spend the most time chatting with and what their privacy and location settings are.</p><p>TikTok said it would add additional controls to allow parents and children to better customize their feeds, but was light on specifics. “We&#39;re investing in new ways for our community to enjoy content based on age appropriateness or family comfort,” said Michael Beckerman, the company’s VP of Public Policy, “We&#39;re developing more features that empower people to shape and customize their experience in the app.”</p><p>But the senators of the Commerce Committee seemed unimpressed by these promises. Throughout the hearing, they pushed the companies on issues like algorithmically-boosted content about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-eating-disorder-support-features-172304356.html"><ins>eating disorders</ins></a> and self harm on YouTube and TikTok. Snap’s Stout was pushed on what the company is doing to stop <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/pills-bought-on-snapchat-deadly/"><ins>drug dealers</ins></a> on its platform.</p><p>Several Republican senators also pushed Beckerman on TikTok’s ties to Chinese parent company ByteDance, and how it handles US user data. In one particularly memorable exchange, Senator Ted Cruz said Beckerman was dodging questions about TikTok’s affiliation with a company called Beijing ByteDance Technology, which reportedly <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/beijing-tightens-grip-on-bytedance-by-quietly-taking-stake-china-board-seat"><ins>has links</ins></a> to the Chinese government. Beckerman also deflected questions about what data TikTok collects by saying Facebook and Instagram collect more data about users than TikTok does.</p><p>Though Facebook wasn’t officially part of the hearing, disclosures from whistleblower Frances Haugen were referenced several times. Senator Richard Blumenthal, who at a previous hearing said Facebook and other companies were facing a “big tobacco moment,” said that “tech is not irredeemably bad like big tobacco.”</p><p>But he said that the companies need to do much more than prove they are “different” from Facebook. “I understand from your testimony that your defense is ‘we’re not Facebook,’” he said. “Being different from Facebook is not a defense. That bar is in the gutter. It&#39;s not a defense to say that you are different.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-tiktok-snapchat-youtube-204825470.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a5ac1b9-783e-4dde-8d2b-963a9f7d6a8e</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 20:48:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635285636</ingested><modified>2021-10-26T22:00:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a0b44e30-3699-11ec-bd7f-cdb3692d9e07" width="3600" height="2401" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a0b44e30-3699-11ec-bd7f-cdb3692d9e07" width="3600" height="2401" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samuel Corum via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 26: Ranking Member Sen.

The automaker has <a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/news.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2021/oct/1026-ultium-charger.html">launched</a> a community charging initiative that will install as many as 40,000 Level 2 charging stations across North America. The program will give dealers up to 10 chargers they can place at &quot;key locations&quot; in their neighborhoods, such as apartments, colleges and businesses. The units won&#39;t be limited to GM EV drivers.</p><p>These chargers will also be available to buy directly both through dealerships and online. GM ultimately plans three chargers, including a basic 11.5kW/48-amp model, a &quot;premium&quot; version of that charger (with touchscreen and camera) and a more powerful 19.2kW/80-amp model. The community effort starts in 2022 and is part of a larger $750 million investment through <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-ultium-charge-360-ev-charging-192135046.html">Ultium Charge 360</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Level 2 charging isn&#39;t very fast. This is more like a wall charger you&#39;d buy for your home (where overnight charging is fine) than a speedy option like a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-tesla-open-superchargers-other-evs-035136832.html">Tesla Supercharger</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-29-electrify-america-high-powered-ev-charging-stations-online.html">Electrify America&#39;s fast stations</a>. The distribution also isn&#39;t quite as good as it sounds. Dealers may want to install multiple stations in one location to minimize queuing.</p><p>This could still be welcome news. Many <a href="https://www.engadget.com/electrify-america-boost-plan-ev-network-141651830.html">charging network expansions</a> focus on high-powered chargers intended for long-distance trips.
