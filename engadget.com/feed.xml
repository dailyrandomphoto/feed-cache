They&#39;re fairly well regarded. But one thing they&#39;re not, is cheap. The base model <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/audiofuse/overview">AudioFuse</a> is $699. It is <em>not</em> for the casual bedroom producer. But, the company knows that the more people making music, the bigger its customer base, so serving that entry level is important. The MiniFuse line is the answer to that need.&nbsp;</p><p>The lineup of three models starts at $99 for the <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/minifuse/minifuse1#en">MiniFuse 1</a>. It&#39;s the most basic of the new devices with a single combo input for XLR and 1/4-inch instruments. But it has the same preamps, 110db dynamic range, five-year warranty and software bundle as the rest of the lineup. All the MiniFuses can also act as USB hubs, so you can connect a controller through the interface and save some port space on your PC. What you lose mostly by opting for the most affordable option is the MIDI in and out ports. You also can&#39;t blend direct monitoring with the USB output, you can only switch between the two.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="64f8080fcfc64f3a9e55920f17389f94"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pe04RI1erIQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The $149 <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/minifuse/minifuse2#en">MiniFuse 2</a> adds a second input, MIDI in and out ports and has a mix control for balancing between direct monitoring of your input and what&#39;s coming out of your PC. This is handy for recording live audio when even the tiniest of latency is unacceptable.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/minifuse/minifuse4#en">MiniFuse 4</a> hasn&#39;t gotten a price tag yet, and wont be shipping until next year. But it has line inputs around the back, two additional audio outputs and an additional headphone jack so you and a collaborator can both monitor a track together without filling your recording space with more noise. If you use a decent amount of outboard gear or frequently work with a vocalist this is probably the way to go. The extra outputs and inputs are especially handy for routing audio out of your computer, processing it with external effects then running it back into your DAW for final mixing.&nbsp;</p><p>The MiniFuse line comes with a solid bundle of software including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ableton-live-11-daw-hands-on-review-upgrades-explained-160047192.html">Ableton Live</a> Lite, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-v-collection-8-analog-lab-v-hands-on-softsynth-vst-173441647.html">Analog Lab</a> Intro, a bundle of four <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-fx-collection-2-22-plugins-youll-actually-use-vst-170115595.html">Arturia FX</a>, Native Instruments Guitar Rig 6 LE and three month subscriptions to both Auto-Tune Unlimited and Splice.</p><p>The MiniFuse 1 and MiniFuse 2 are available to pre order now and will start shipping in November.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-announces-mini-fuse-lineup-of-affordable-audio-interfaces-204411420.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aea789a7-9ec6-414a-af7e-226046d23733</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 22:55:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632864206</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T21:23:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e29ff600-2096-11ec-afe9-cea78c978084" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e29ff600-2096-11ec-afe9-cea78c978084" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arturia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arturia MiniFuse]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arturia MiniFuse]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix buys 'Oxenfree' developer Night School Studio]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The team behind hit indie game <em>Oxenfree </em>is joining Netflix, marking the first time the streaming giant has acquired a game developer.

Lucid Motors said it has <a href="https://www.lucidmotors.com/media-room/lucid-starts-production-deliveries-begin-october">started</a> production of the luxury EV and expects to deliver the first Dream Edition models in late October. There will only be 520 Dream units (conveniently a match for the car&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucids-longest-range-air-ev-has-a-prodigious-520-miles-of-epa-range-123000043.html">520-mile estimated range</a>). However, Lucid won&#39;t be hurting for early customers. Even if only some of the 13,000 reservation holders commit to a purchase, that&#39;s a significant volume for an upscale car from a relatively new brand.</p><p>Those numbers might climb. The fledgling automaker plans a rapid expansion that will add about 65 acres (2.85 million square feet) to its Casa Grande, Arizona factory. It may need the extra output, too. Lucid plans to mass-produce its first SUV, the Gravity, in 2023, and electric SUVs have lately been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-2020-production-half-million-cars-154826010.html">in high demand</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Air starts at $77,400. In addition to its potentially Tesla-beating range, it promises rare perks like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-dolby-atmos-160018074.html">Dolby Atmos audio</a>, very quick charging (20 minutes for 300 miles) and a 34-inch cockpit display.</p><p>There&#39;s no guarantee Lucid will succeed when competing against Tesla, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html">Rivian</a> and rapidly electrifying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fords-mach-e-is-a-stylish-and-capable-ev-but-its-no-mustang-153044259.html">incumbent car brands</a>. While its strategy is familiar to Tesla fans (its first truly large-scale EV was also a luxury sedan), Lucid is entering a much more established market with competitors that have ample resources and name recognition. With that said, just making it to production is notable feat. EV startups like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/recordbreaking-faraday-future-prototype-evs-auction-211946137.html">Faraday Future</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lordstown-motors-232701777.html">Lordstown Motors</a> are still struggling to reach that point, giving Lucid a considerable lead over some of its key rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-delivery-date-214305594.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb535e79-c5ae-45a4-9e25-3bc9278b3d6e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 21:43:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632864193</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T21:23:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8e192690-209d-11ec-9779-6c5dc1de838c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8e192690-209d-11ec-9779-6c5dc1de838c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucid Motors]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lucid Air EV in production at the Casa Grande, Arizona factory]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lucid Air EV in production at the Casa Grande, Arizona factory]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Amazon's entire new hardware event right here]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon tends to avoid livestreaming its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hardware-fall-2020-echo-ring-eero-012946012.html">big hardware events</a>, but it&#39;s happy to share video after the fact ‚Äî and this year&#39;s presentation is one you might want to see.

It&#39;s essentially a tablet on wheels, roughly the size of a small dog, with cameras that allow it to detect anomalies in the house, record video, and send alerts to your phone. It also connects with Ring, Amazon&#39;s popular personal security system, allowing the robot to roll around on its own and proactively investigate odd events while the homeowners are away. Its name is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">Astro</a>. Yes, it has eyes.</p><p>Astro was the cap to an hour-long event that started with kids&#39; toys and health services, and ended in a stream of dystopian police-state devices, each presented with an Amazon-branded smile. There was the smart thermostat, the interactive camera for kids, and Amazon&#39;s own version of the Fitbit, followed by the Ring Always Home Cam, Ring Alarm Pro, Ring Virtual Security Guard, Blink Video Doorbell and floodlight cameras, and finally, Astro, the robot with an extendable arm that can record every inch of your house without any user input. Add a layer of ominous music that slowly creeps up in volume, and Amazon&#39;s show was an instant episode of <em>Black Mirror</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f28bdc20-2099-11ec-9fff-89bbc8de75ac" alt="Amazon Astro" data-uuid="953527f9-3e52-349b-8d60-1ca37bff317c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>In Amazon&#39;s vision of the future, homeowners are constantly watching their security cameras, tracking delivery people and spying on their dogs, heavily relying on the Ring ecosystem the entire time. Astro and the Ring Always Home Cam, Amazon&#39;s autonomous security drone, are the company&#39;s most visually striking devices, tapping into science-fiction dreams of robot butlers and AI-powered pets. They move on their own and stream data directly to the homeowner at any time, satiating the persistent breed of home-security paranoia generated by neighborhoods of curbside cameras and Nextdoor threads.</p><p>While the robots are the face of Amazon&#39;s in-home security business, Ring is the backbone. Ring has been leading the home-security charge in the United States since 2018, selling <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210512005336/en/Strategy-Analytics-Amazons-Ring-Remained-atop-the-Video-Doorbell-Market-in-2020">1.4 million doorbells</a> in 2020 alone and cornering 18 percent of the market overall. Unfortunately, Amazon has proven to be a near-sighted steward of this massive, unregulated residential surveillance system.&nbsp;</p><p>Since 2018, Ring has signed agreements with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-ring-2000-police-fire-departments-213301374.html">more than 2,000 police departments</a> across the US, providing authorities with access to recordings from residential cameras, often without warrants and according to the company&#39;s own parameters. In <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests">May and June 2020</a>, for instance, the Los Angeles Police Department used the Ring ecosystem to request footage of Black Lives Matter protests from residential doorbell cameras, without noting a specific incident that was under investigation. That&#39;s a huge red flag, according to activist groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b141a570-2098-11ec-adbf-6763af19bb94" alt="Ring Always Home Cam" data-uuid="330f0cba-4187-3071-93e9-a2814428f8ec"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>&quot;If police request hours of footage on either side of a specific incident, they may receive hours of people engaging in First Amendment protected activities with a vague hope that a camera may have captured illegal activity at some point,&quot; <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests">the EFF said</a> in February. The report continued, &quot;Technologies like Ring have the potential to provide the police with video footage covering nearly every inch of an entire neighborhood. This poses an incredible risk to First Amendment rights. People are less likely to exercise their right to political speech, protest, and assembly if they know that police can acquire and retain footage of them. This creates risks of retribution or reprisal, especially at protests against police violence. Ring cameras, ubiquitous in many neighborhoods, create the possibility that if enough people share footage with police, authorities are able to follow protestors‚Äô movements, block by block.&quot;</p><p>As the number of police departments with Amazon contracts has skyrocketed, authorities themselves have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/aug/29/ring-amazon-police-partnership-social-media-neighbor">pushing Ring devices</a> on the citizens they serve, using materials prepared by the company and earning incentives for getting folks to download Ring&#39;s Neighbors app. Amazon has effectively turned the US police force into its own mini marketing squad, blurring the lines between public safety and private-company loyalty.</p><p>On top of problematic police partnerships, the Ring ecosystem is filled with unchecked bias. A <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qvyvzd/amazons-home-security-company-is-turning-everyone-into-cops">2019 study by <em>Motherboard</em></a> found people of color were disproportionately labeled as &quot;suspicious&quot; in the Neighbors app, a phenomenon that feeds into racism and hyper-vigilance, creating less-safe environments overall.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9a92a670-2099-11ec-bf9b-bd87c39b8ae7" alt="Ring" data-uuid="03d13dce-786b-323d-950d-a1469c886462"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Ring has taken steps to address some of these issues, such as changing the wording in the Neighbors app from &quot;suspicious&quot; to &quot;unexpected activity.&quot; Additionally, police will no longer be able to send bulk emails to Ring users who might have footage they want ‚Äî instead, there&#39;s a portal on Neighbors where they can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-neighbors-app-request-for-assistance-posts-100025122.html">request footage publicly</a>. Of course, these aren&#39;t solutions. Changing a word does nothing to temper the breeding ground of suspicion and racism inherent in the Neighbors app, and making police requests public doesn&#39;t stop them from happening, warrantless and with broad boundaries that are still determined by Amazon, a massive ecommerce company.</p><p>&quot;The network is predicated on perpetuating irrational fear of neighborhood crime, often yielding disproportionate scrutiny against people of color, all for the purposes of selling more cameras,&quot; <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/06/ring-changed-how-police-request-door-camera-footage-what-it-means-and-doesnt-mean">the EFF said</a> in June. &quot;Ring does so through police partnerships, which now encompass 1 in every 10 police departments in the United States. At their core, these partnerships facilitate bulk requests from police officers to Ring customers for their camera footage, built on a growing Ring surveillance network of millions of public-facing cameras. EFF adamantly opposes these Ring-police partnerships and advocates for their dissolution.&quot;</p><p>As Amazon continues to build out its Ring ecosystem, police partnerships intact, it&#39;s clear that the company is not focused on rebuilding public policy, reducing crime or eliminating everyday racism. Amazon is focused on selling Ring cameras; Amazon is focused on making money. Personally, that doesn&#39;t make me feel safe.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-police-state-robots-personal-security-dystopia-203641655.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">efa5eb01-d37d-46b7-9b8e-7ed1438dcf8c</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 20:36:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632861702</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T20:41:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f738dee0-2098-11ec-9beb-c5ec108bc44c" width="3048" height="1890" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f738dee0-2098-11ec-9beb-c5ec108bc44c" width="3048" height="1890" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Astro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Astro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Here's everything Amazon announced at its September hardware event]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon held its annual fall hardware event on Tuesday. It&#39;s too bad the company didn&#39;t stream the proceedings to the public because it was jam-packed with announcements. We saw everything from new Echo devices to an Alexa-powered robot. But worry not, we have you covered. Here&#39;s everything the company announced today.</p><h2></h2><h2>Astro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcdd26d0-207f-11ec-afff-2ea66d38964e" alt="Amazon Astro" data-uuid="fef8f3a5-e563-32f7-9dbd-45d34201e21a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>In an event packed with offbeat products, Amazon saved its most unusual one for last. In <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-astro-robot-165934602.html">Astro</a>, the company has created an Alexa-powered robot that can move around your home. It has three primary functions. It can provide home security, check-in on loved ones and pets and offer Alexa functionality on the go. When it becomes available later this year, Astro will cost $999.99 before it eventually increases to $1449.99 at a later date.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Echo Show 15</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f804be90-2091-11ec-9bff-700d0016980e" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="c9bee933-525b-3d79-a59d-e880c205ca43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Amazon is adding yet another model to its Echo Show family. Its latest addition features a 15.6-inch 1080p display that the company envisions you mounting on the wall in spaces like your home‚Äôs kitchen. New to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-161730394.html">Echo Show 15</a> is a redesigned home screen that emphasizes Alexa widgets. The smart display also features a camera and a new feature that will adjust the contents of the home screen to you when the device recognizes your face. Sales of the $250 Echo Show 15 will start later this year.</p><h2>Halo</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/85668d00-2091-11ec-8778-1184c4ce48dd" alt="Halo View" data-uuid="786b32f3-f7e0-337c-969c-6c3c79eec8c4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon had two major announcements related to its Halo fitness product. First, the company introduced its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-view-price-163738227.html">Halo View fitness band</a>. In short, Amazon essentially added an AMOLED color display to its Halo wearable and made the resulting device cheaper. It doesn‚Äôt come with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-platform-134146361.html">tone-detecting microphone</a> that made the company‚Äôs first foray into fitness wearables so controversial, but what it can do is track your heart rate, skin temperature, steps and more. Halo View isn‚Äôt available to purchase just yet, but it will cost $80 when it does become available.</p><p>Outside of new hardware, the company announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-nutrition-164816502.html">Halo Fitness and Halo Nutrition</a>, two new features that will come included with its yearly $80 Halo subscription. The former is an alternative to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fitness-plus-review-two-weeks-test-watch-music-workout-160058155.html">Apple Fitness+</a> and other similar services. The latter, meanwhile, includes personalized recipes and meal planning. Halo Fitness will roll out later this year, while Halo Nutrition will arrive at the start of 2022.</p><h2>Ring and Blink</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/25224640-2092-11ec-bdee-4e8c924e8725" alt="Blink Doorbell" data-uuid="650becd9-3466-31cd-8849-95bc33ad6c1a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon‚Äôs Ring and Blink home security subsidiaries had an entire segment dedicated to their products.

It‚Äôs a teleconferencing display the company designed for kids. Glow includes a projector that can create a 19-inch touch-sensitive playspace for all the games and activities included with the device. Glow will cost $249.99 when it goes on sale in the next few weeks, but Amazon said that&#39;s just an introductory price.</p><h2>All the rest</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5ba3a200-2091-11ec-b7fb-a0dfaaf41aa8" alt="Amazon Smart Thermostat" data-uuid="d29e3ccd-a6fd-317d-94ac-b7cf250e3e41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Amazon wouldn‚Äôt be Amazon if the company weren‚Äôt trying to create more affordable versions of some of the best-selling products on its marketplace. So it should come as no surprise it announced an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-60-dollar-alexa-powered-thermostat-161738943.html">Alexa-enabled smart thermostat</a> that only costs $60.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of new hardware, Tuesday‚Äôs event saw the company announce various updates for its Alexa. In brief, the company worked with Disney to make a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hey-disney-164025746.html">voice assistant</a> that will be available on Echo devices and Walt Disney World Resort hotel rooms. It also introduced a feature called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-together-service-171909617.html">Alexa Together</a> that turns an Echo speaker or smart display into an emergency support device for your family members. Lastly, the company is adding <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-adding-offline-voice-recognition-to-alexa-devices-171145961.html">offline voice support for Alexa devices</a>.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon‚Äôs fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-2021-hardware-event-roundup-195702185.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8b0dacb1-3797-4d45-ac38-5c65273643ca</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 19:57:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632867565</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T22:19:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c03ef160-2091-11ec-89ef-210d717a39e2" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c03ef160-2091-11ec-89ef-210d717a39e2" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon family]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon family]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Some Xbox owners can now test cloud gaming on their consoles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is preparing to complete a large piece of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-streaming-hardware-game-pass-e3-2021-130019814.html">cloud gaming puzzle</a> when it brings the option <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-cloud-gaming-game-pass-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-one-173404923.html"><ins>to Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S sometime this holiday season</ins></a>.

To see a full list of games you can stream, go to My Games &amp; Apps, then Full Library and Xbox Game Pass, and change the filter to Cloud Gaming. At the outset, you&#39;ll be able to play more than 100 games without having to download them ‚Äî as long as you have a sturdy enough internet connection.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="eebe440949f44ed398701543d544aa59"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta) for Console is coming to a random subset of Alpha Skip-Ahead and Alpha <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XboxInsiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#XboxInsiders</a> today!

You also can&#39;t make any in-game purchases while playing a cloud gaming title, but you can do so through the Store on your console or the web. Meanwhile, if you have installed a game on an external drive that isn&#39;t connected to your Xbox, you won&#39;t be able to play it over the cloud. That seems like an annoying bug but hey, that&#39;s what beta tests are for.</p><p>Don&#39;t fret too much if you don&#39;t have access just yet.

The next time you deliver a presentation with Keynote, you&#39;ll be able to include live video feeds directly in the slides. You can resize the video feed and change the look with masks, frames, drop shadows and reflections.</p><p>With the Mac version of Keynote, you can add feeds from multiple external cameras, and share a connected iPhone or iPad screen, which could prove useful for interactive demos. There are more collaboration features too. A new multi-presenter function lets anyone control a shared slideshow and advance slides remotely using a Mac, iPhone or iPad. This could come in handy for group presentations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The changes to Pages are largely iPhone-focused. The Screen View feature arranges text, images and other aspects of the document into a single-column view. Apple has increased the text size, while images are sized to fit your phone&#39;s screen. You can also view tables by scrolling left and right. Users will still be able to edit documents as usual when Screen View is active. You don&#39;t need to do anything to set up the feature, and it works with all word processing documents. Apple says you can toggle off Screen View so you can see the proper layout before you&#39;re ready to share or print the document.</p><p>As for Numbers, you can now get to grips with pivot tables across Apple devices. You&#39;ll be able to summarize, group and rearrange data to spot and study trends and patterns. There are options to visualize the pivot tables with charts and to share pivot data without disclosing the source data. You can also import pivot tables from and export them to Microsoft Excel.</p><p>Elsewhere, there&#39;s a new chart type called radar charts. Apple says this &quot;makes it easy to visually compare multiple variables with similarities shown as overlapping areas, allowing differences and outliers to really stand out.&quot; There are new filters you can use to highlight unique entries or duplicate data.</p><p>All three apps now support Apple&#39;s new translation tools on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ios%2015">iOS 15</a>, iPadOS 15 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/macos%20monterey">macOS Monterey</a>.

The so-called &quot;caregiver&quot; can see notifications and alerts when someone uses Alexa as a way of letting you know that someone they want to keep an eye on is up and about. It also lets the &quot;care receiver&quot; say &quot;Alexa, call for help&quot; and it&#39;ll contact the caregiver immediately. Amazon didn&#39;t charge for this, but today it&#39;s adding a new feature called Alexa Together to the service. It&#39;ll be a $20/month service that gives an aging family member 24/7 access to Urgent Response, which Amazon describes as a professional emergency help line.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexa Together will also make caregiving easier to share among multiple family members by letting multiple people be designated as support contacts for a single individual. Other features include support for third-party devices that can detect when someone has fallen at home, the ability to add contacts to an individual&#39;s Alexa account so they can make hands-free calls, and set reminders on someone else&#39;s device or link up a music service for them to play tunes through.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At a high level, it sounds like Alexa Together basically makes it easier for other people to manage a family member&#39;s Alexa-capable device so they use it more. And if they use it more, the caregiver will see that it&#39;s being used and know their family member is going about their normal day. It&#39;s a bit convoluted, but the 24/7 access to Urgent Response might be worth the $20 per month cost. Alexa Together will have a free six-month trial period (or one full year if you&#39;ve been using the Alexa Care Hub already) when it launches later this year.</p><div id="8d1e8626509643b48f8094a85a055d0f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alexa Together is designed to help aging family members feel more comfortable and confident living independently, and to give the entire family peace of mind.

The most interesting, by far, are the new privacy features coming to the latest Alexa devices. Soon, US customers can choose to have all of their voice commands processed on their Alexa devices. That means these audio clips won&#39;t be sent to the cloud and they&#39;ll be automatically deleted after the Alexa device processes them.</p><p>The online retailer has received much scrutiny over the years when it comes to the privacy implications of its smart speakers and displays. Back in 2019, Amazon added a toggle that let users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-03-amazon-alexa-review-opt-out-privacy.html">opt-out</a> of having their voice recordings and message transcripts &quot;manually reviewed,&quot; and before that, the company added an option to delete your entire voice history with one command. This new feature builds on that, but it seemingly will only work with the latest Echo devices with the AZ1 Neural Edge processor. According to Amazon, the feature will first be available on the 4th-generation Echo and the Echo Show 10, and will come to more devices in the future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Most other new Alexa features are only available on Amazon&#39;s smart displays, like the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-161730394.html">Echo Show 15</a>. First, Sling TV will be coming to all Echo Show devices soon, adding to the already lengthy list of streaming services accessible from Amazon&#39;s displays. Second, Echo devices with cameras will be able to use Visual ID, a feature that lets Alexa recognize you when you&#39;re in the camera&#39;s field of view. By knowing who&#39;s in front of the camera, the device&#39;s display can then present personalized information like calendar alerts and TV show preferences. It&#39;s important to note that Visual ID is something you have to enroll in ‚Äî not an automatic feature ‚Äî and you can delete your Visual ID at any time.</p><p>Amazon&#39;s also revamping <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Care Hub service" href="https://amzn.to/3zTsFvr">Care Hub</a>, which connects caregivers and their loved ones using the Alexa app and compatible devices, into a new subscription service called Alexa Together. This essentially lets caregivers check in on others remotely and set up things like alerts, emergency contact information and more. It includes features like Urgent Response, which gives you access to a professional emergency help line, and Remote Assist, which lets caregivers do things like set reminders, link music services and more to make things easier for their loved ones. Alexa Together will be available later this year for $20 per month, and current Care Hub customers can get one year of the service free.</p><p>Finally, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-hey-disney-164025746.html">Amazon partnered with Disney</a> to bring a new voice assistant to its smart devices. &quot;Hey, Disney&quot; is the entertainment giant&#39;s own assistant that&#39;s built on on Amazon&#39;s Alexa technology. In addition to giving you access to characters from the Disney universe to chat with, the new assistant will also be able to set timers, reminders, check the weather and more. Echo users will be able to purchase the &quot;Hey, Disney&quot; assistant from the Alexa Skills store in 2022, and it will be available on Echo devices in Walt Disney World Resort hotel rooms.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon‚Äôs fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-adding-offline-voice-recognition-to-alexa-devices-171145961.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">950a9825-feb4-44f8-ac18-a33aa95b9565</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 17:11:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632850003</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T17:26:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/2f844110-cdea-11eb-bded-3d9cdc0c6b11" width="1920" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/2f844110-cdea-11eb-bded-3d9cdc0c6b11" width="1920" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 8]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 8]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Blink unveils a no-frills $50 video doorbell]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s Blink has developed a reputation for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-blink-mini-camera-announcement-183048551.html">low-cost security cameras</a>, and that now extends to your front door. The brand has unveiled a Blink Video Doorbell that, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:at $50" href="https://amzn.to/3ASZPNo">at $50</a>, could be a solid option if you&#39;re not interested in some of the frills available <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-smart-doorbell-alexa-radar-birds-eye-view-motion-detection-143037689.html">from Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arlo-video-doorbell-pro-3-irl-150052184.html">rival brands</a>. It &#39;only&#39; captures 1080p video, but it supports Alexa integration (of course), your choice of wired or wireless connections and the option to store footage on a USB thumb drive (when attached to a Sync Module 2) if you don&#39;t want a subscription for cloud storage.</p><p>Two AA batteries will keep the doorbell running for up to two years, although that&#39;s with a wired connection.

Amazon is working on an Alexa-powered robot on wheels. At its fall hardware event, the company showed off <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Astro" href="https://amzn.to/3CSlVQp">Astro</a>. Set to initially cost $1,000 when it becomes available later this year, it&#39;s essentially an Alexa display that can roam around your home.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/meet-astro-a-home-robot-unlike-any-other">robot</a> features a periscope camera that allows it to expand its field of view beyond floor level.

With Ring&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-eero-ring-alarm-pro-base-station-164341341.html">Protect Pro</a> subscription service, you can also program Astro to patrol your home while you&#39;re away. It can detect the sound of a smoke alarm, carbon monoxide detector or breaking glass. It will send you notifications when it notices something usual, and you can save what it records to your Ring account.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fcdd26d0-207f-11ec-afff-2ea66d38964e" alt="Amazon Astro" data-uuid="fef8f3a5-e563-32f7-9dbd-45d34201e21a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Naturally, you can issue it all the usual voice commands supported by Alexa. That means you can also use it in conjunction with Amazon&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alexa-together-service-171909617.html">Alexa Together</a> feature, allowing your family members to contact you in case of an emergency. And if you&#39;re the type of person that likes to walk around when you&#39;re on a call, Astro can follow you around the house during video calls.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>So how does Amazon plan to convince you to allow a moving camera into your home? Well, aside from the Wall-E eyes, you can put Astro in a do not disturb mode that limits how much it moves during the day or night. Additionally, the company says you can set out-of-bounds zones to prevent the robot from entering specific rooms or areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3e88d3e0-2080-11ec-b6fb-70ecfb3920fd" alt="Amazon Astro" data-uuid="9ee93b4b-d5e4-37e1-9385-45d243ec7e28"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Astro is one of those projects Amazon has reportedly been working on for years.

Not surprisingly, you can add ingredients to your Alexa shopping list if you discover a recipe you like.</p><p>Halo Fitness will be available through the core Halo app later in 2021. You&#39;ll have to wait until January 2022 to try Halo Nutrition. You&#39;ll get a year&#39;s worth of the Halo subscription service if you buy a Halo View, so it won&#39;t cost much to try beyond purchasing the hardware. The question is whether or not you want to commit that deeply to Amazon&#39;s wearable vision.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon‚Äôs fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-nutrition-164816502.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">04bd1afa-50bf-45c6-b1a6-650f326cd3ed</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:48:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632851736</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T17:55:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/94a7b300-207a-11ec-bdfe-40328ac92345" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/94a7b300-207a-11ec-bdfe-40328ac92345" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Halo Fitness and Halo View activity tracker]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Halo Fitness and Halo View activity tracker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon Glow is a kid-focused video call device with interactive activities]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon&#39;s latest product is about creating more interactive video calling experiences for kids.

The Amazon-owned security company has teamed up with Eero, the Amazon-owned networking firm, to incorporate the latter‚Äôs tech in the former‚Äôs hardware. With the Alarm Pro including an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-eero-6-mesh-wifi-router-173331388.html">Eero router inside</a>, the one module can now sit at the heart of your home‚Äôs internet and security system.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/92aa8150-1d36-11ec-ba7f-e1299e9a8917" alt="Ring Alarm Pro Hardware Image" data-uuid="90e291d5-3086-3662-a140-4e1e506daff3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ring</div></figure><p>In addition, Ring will now sell you additional battery packs which can be used to extend the working life of your Alarm system during power outages up to 24 hours. It‚Äôs worth saying that you can‚Äôt simply shove an Eero router next to your existing Ring Alarm product, however, since many of the new features take advantage of the integrations available to the Pro.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a51b9310-1d36-11ec-9efd-5890289565f9" alt="Image of the Ring Alarm Pro Battery Pack" data-uuid="9c325cf3-8359-3b86-912e-d570af923fc1"><figcaption>You will need to buy four packs to get your base station&#39;s battery life to 24 hours.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ring</div></figure><p>To take advantage of the technology, you‚Äôll need to sign up to Ring‚Äôs new subscription product, dubbed Protect Pro. The package offers cloud video storage, professional monitoring, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=18021383011">Alexa Guard Plus</a>, 24/7 backup internet for your security devices (via an LTE module in the Ring Pro base station) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-27-eero-secure-subscriptions-router.html">Eero‚Äôs cybersecurity subscription product</a> for network protection. This, at least in the US as it launches, will set you back $20 a month, or $200 per year per location up front.</p><p>Ring COO Mike Harris said that the decision to work with Eero was not one foisted down from upon high by Amazon. Instead, Harris said that both companies saw the opportunity to work together to help leverage their individual skills in tandem.</p><p>At the same time, Ring is launching a system dubbed ‚ÄúVirtual Security Guard,‚Äù which connects users to third-party security guards. You‚Äôll need to pay for that separately, but you can hand over access to select Ring camera feeds to those companies who can keep a watch over your property. It is only when motion is detected that an operator can access your feed, and can speak to whoever is there to determine their intentions. Ring adds that third parties can‚Äôt view motion events when the camera is disarmed, and can‚Äôt download, share or save the clips of what‚Äôs going on in your front yard. The first company to sign up for the program is Rapid Response, with others expected to join in the near future.</p><p>Ring also offered up some good news for existing Ring doorbell owners, at least if you‚Äôre rocking the Pro 2 or the 2020-and-newer version of the standard bell. Those devices will soon be able to take advantage of smart alerts that will let you know if a package was delivered to a specially-designated zone on your doorstep. In addition, you can set up your Spotlight Cam Battery to identify an object left in a specific state, such as if you‚Äôve left your garage door open. This should be useful, again, to avoid the curse of the ‚Äúdid I leave X unlocked‚Äù when you‚Äôre miles away from home.</p><p>The Ring Alarm Pro is available to pre-order today for $250, with the Protect Pro package costing you $20 a month. If you want to try Virtual Security Guard, meanwhile, you will need to contact the company and apply for early access</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon‚Äôs fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ring-eero-ring-alarm-pro-base-station-164341341.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">873c172b-31a8-4e75-8512-5d5c24440d41</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:43:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632847424</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T16:43:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7a90eb40-1d36-11ec-adfb-518b57857a18" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7a90eb40-1d36-11ec-adfb-518b57857a18" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ring]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Device family image of the Ring Alarm Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ring Alarm Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon made Disney a 'Hey, Disney!' voice assistant]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon and Disney have just announced a new voice assistant called &quot;<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hey, Disney!" href="https://amzn.to/3AUAHFS">Hey, Disney!</a>&quot; Built on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-is-adding-offline-voice-recognition-to-alexa-devices-171145961.html">Amazon&#39;s Alexa technology</a>, this new Disney assistant will be available on your home Echo as well as in Echo devices located in Walt Disney World Resort hotel rooms.

However, Halo View customers can still take advantage of Live Mode for Tone, which is an in-app membership feature and not dependent on the band. Live Mode for Tone enables you to analyze your tone in real-time.&quot;</p><p>As a refresher, Tone was launched with the original Halo, and, with your permission, used that band&#39;s mics to listen to you throughout the day. It would then detect the way you&#39;re speaking and tell you if you sound stressed, angry, happy, excited and more. The idea was that your tone of voice was a better indicator of your mental health and how much distress you might be experiencing.&nbsp;</p><p>But not only did the idea of Amazon policing the way you speak sound dystopian, in practice it also wasn&#39;t very useful.

Body composition, activity intensity and scores, movement health guides, sleep scores and stages are things you won&#39;t get without paying the fee.</p><p>Amazon is adding more content to its Halo package though, introducing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-fitness-nutrition-164816502.html">Fitness and Nutrition programs today</a> at no extra cost.

As is its modus operandi, Amazon is undercutting Fitbit, since the latter&#39;s Premium is twice as pricey at $10 a month.</p><p>We&#39;re still awaiting more details from Amazon on the Halo View&#39;s specific dimensions, screen size and more, and the device isn&#39;t available for sale at the moment. You can &quot;sign up to be notified when Halo View is available,&quot; the company said. Fitness content will roll out to the Halo app later this year, though, while Nutrition will be available in January 2022. Regardless, the View is available in three colors, green and lavender, though you can also swap the bands out for something you prefer.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon‚Äôs fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-view-price-163738227.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">16f7da3a-955d-45b7-b8cc-4e6e102fe51b</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:37:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632851206</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T17:46:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/50269ed0-207a-11ec-b5f7-3e575d322de7" width="3600" height="2400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/50269ed0-207a-11ec-b5f7-3e575d322de7" width="3600" height="2400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Halo View]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Halo View]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Alexa-enabled Smart Thermostat only costs $60]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is challenging Google&#39;s Nest with a $60 Alexa-enabled <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/how-were-inventing-to-shape-a-sustainable-future">Smart Thermostat</a>. The thermostat is Energy Star certified and allows users to control their home&#39;s temperature and use Alexa to set custom routines for heating and cooling.</p><p>The Smart Thermostat is a first for Amazon, which billed the gadget as part of its larger sustainability efforts. The company said it worked with Resideo, the company that makes Honeywell thermostats, to create the product, which was designed to be compatible with ‚Äúmost‚Äù existing 24V HVAC systems.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So far, Amazon hasn&#39;t said much about the device itself, though it appears to be relatively basic compared to some smart thermostat setups. Though the thermostat can be controlled with Alexa, it requires a separate Echo or other Alexa-enabled device to use. The device is also compatible with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whahElqS5eA">Hunches</a>, an Alexa-powered feature that allows the assistant to act based on your previous actions without the need for a separate command. For example, the thermostat could automatically adjust the temperature if it has a &quot;hunch&quot; that you&#39;ve left the house or gone to bed.</p><p>But at just $60, the price could be a big draw for those who already use Amazon&#39;s smart home products.  Additionally, some people may be eligible for rebates via their utility provider, which could bring the price down to as low as $10, Amazon said. The Smart Thermostat is available now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J4C8871?ref_=ods_surl_sr">for pre-order</a>, and will start shipping November 4th.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon‚Äôs fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-60-dollar-alexa-powered-thermostat-161738943.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b6e897a1-1588-468f-8f60-5744236531e5</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:17:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632851806</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T17:57:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8ab59af0-2076-11ec-bebf-b9b270249d5a" width="8000" height="4500" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8ab59af0-2076-11ec-bebf-b9b270249d5a" width="8000" height="4500" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon's $59 thermostat.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[amazon thermostat]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's $250 Echo Show 15 is a smart display for your wall]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has already released updated versions of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">5, 8 </a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-10-review-130012759.html">10-inch Echo Shows</a> earlier this year, but it‚Äôs not done with smart displays just yet. Today, at its annual fall event, the company announced the Echo Show 15, its largest one to-date. With a 15.6-inch 1080p display, the Echo Show 15 almost looks like a large picture frame. It can be wall-mounted or placed on a stand, in either portrait or landscape orientation. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 15 will retail for $249.99" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MQLDFF6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;language=en_US">Echo Show 15 will retail for $249.99</a>.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="882292db-2b7a-4dce-b47e-ab13c37dd7e6"/><p>Since it has such a large display, Amazon has introduced a redesigned home screen to go along with the Echo Show 15. You can configure it so that part of the screen has the usual rotating array of ambient content like headlines and weather updates (those who already have an Echo Show will be familiar with this), while the rest of it can be customized with various Alexa widgets. Think of the whole thing as a multifunctional family bulletin board.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those widgets include useful applications like a family calendar, a shared shopping list, sticky notes, to-do lists and reminders. There&#39;s also a &quot;What to Eat&quot; widget that houses recipe recommendations from sources like Allrecipes and Epicurious, restaurant delivery choices and more. It even has a Blue Apron option that helps you order meal kits and shows you step-by-step recipe instructions.&nbsp;</p><p>A &quot;smart home favorites&quot; widget helps you view and control your favorite smart home devices. You can also enable picture-in-picture live camera viewing so you can keep an eye on your kids while you‚Äôre cooking dinner. There‚Äôs also a widget to help you track package deliveries.</p><p>According to Amazon, these Alexa widgets will also be available on the other Echo Shows, but you‚Äôll have to swipe the screen to see them. On the Echo Show 15, however, they can be arranged to appear on the home screen, which can‚Äôt be done on smaller-screened Echo Shows. In the event you have guests over and don‚Äôt want them to see all of your calendars and personal information, you can enable a picture frame mode on the Echo Show 15 so that it only shows photos or art work.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61b9f730-202c-11ec-af7b-aaf814de2d79" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="d7b2a9e2-8a20-345e-ac6d-287755815933"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>Additionally, the Echo Show 15 has a new visual ID feature that‚Äôs able to recognize your face, which will prompt it to show you personalized information such as your calendar appointments, reminders and notes. This is potentially useful in a multi-person household, as you can show sticky notes meant only for specific members of the family, for example. Additionally, if you enroll your child in visual ID, the device will show them age-appropriate content.</p><p>For those who have privacy concerns, visual ID is entirely optional, plus all of the computer vision information remains on the device, with nothing going to the cloud. The microphone and camera have power toggles, and there‚Äôs a built-in camera shutter. Plus, you can always view and delete your voice recordings.</p><p>Much like the other Alexa-powered smart displays, the Echo Show 15 has a bevy of entertainment options that include Prime Video, Netflix, Hulu and more. All Echo Shows will soon support TikTok and Sling TV streaming as well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/909de700-202c-11ec-bfac-4e9fc023f898" alt="Amazon Echo Show 15" data-uuid="ca255ef6-bd34-3bc1-b5ee-c9e0420b639e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>The Echo Show 15 is powered by Amazon‚Äôs AZ2 Neural Edge processor, which powers a lot of the device‚Äôs on-board machine learning and computer vision capabilities. It enables the aforementioned visual ID feature, and it also lets you teach Alexa your personal preferences. For example, you can tell Alexa you‚Äôre a vegetarian, and the next time you ask Alexa for recipes, it‚Äôll remember that and only show you vegetarian recipes.</p><p>One particularly intriguing new feature is that you can also teach Alexa to recognize sounds. So for example, if your refrigerator beeps when it‚Äôs open for too long, you can teach Alexa to recognize that sound, and then notify you that you need to close your fridge door. You can teach it to recognize the doorbell, the microwave ding, the washing machine tune and various other household alerts. This sounds potentially very helpful, especially for those who are hard of hearing.</p><p>Amazon says that the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Show 15" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MQLDFF6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;language=en_US">Echo Show 15</a> will be available later this year. Countertop stands and under-cabinet mount accessories will be sold separately at a yet-to-be-determined price.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Amazon‚Äôs fall hardware event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%202021"><em>right here!</em></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-161730394.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">afc53d62-db54-4569-aaf3-3e5c45024b5b</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:17:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632867873</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T22:24:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ca9333d0-202b-11ec-bff3-fa85496c17c4" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ca9333d0-202b-11ec-bff3-fa85496c17c4" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 15]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 15]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adobe adds AI-powered masking tools to Lightroom]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/adobe"><ins>Adobe</ins></a> has <a href="https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/09/28/from-the-acr-team-masking-reimagined.html"><ins>revealed</ins></a> some new masking upgrades that are coming to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/lightroom"><ins>Lightroom</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Lightroom%20Classic"><ins>Lightroom Classic</ins></a> and Adobe Camera Raw (or ACR, Photoshop&#39;s raw photo processing tool). The company calls it the &quot;biggest change to providing control over selectively enhancing photos&quot; since it released Lightroom 2 in 2008.</p><p>The Adobe Research team wanted to bring AI-powered selection tools such as Select Subject and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/photoshop-desktop-ipad-update-artificial-intelligence-130024695.html"><ins>Sky Replacement</ins></a> from Photoshop into Lightroom and ACR, but the image processing engine used in the latter two was incompatible. The team had to make some big changes under the hood, which gave it a chance to change how selections are handled in Lightroom.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="32c1ef7f58ec4127a587ef7bc4bc96d8"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZLVaLkFPPEA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Until now, ACR, Lightroom and Lightroom Classic have only supported vector-based selections (which are recorded as mathematical expressions), but the AI-powered masks need bitmap (or image-based) support. So, to bring the AI-based tools to those apps, Adobe had to make both approaches work together. It&#39;s still able to use vector-based selections for brush, gradients, and range masks to minimize the storage space needed, while the select subject and select sky tools (which can create a mask for a subject or sky with a single click) use bitmaps.</p><p>As it figured out how to make those two kinds of selections work together, Adobe developed new features for ACR, Lightroom and Lightroom Classic across desktops, mobile devices, tablets and the web. One such upgrade is mask groups, which will let you combine any mask tools. For instance, you&#39;ll be able to use a gradient vector-based tool in concert with an AI-powered feature such as select sky. It&#39;ll be possible to separate a mask from another masking tool as well. You&#39;ll be able to invert selections and there&#39;ll be more options for range masks, such as targeting the entire image.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6f8afcb0-2068-11ec-93f9-af436eca08ec" style="height:968;width:968;" alt="Mask features in Adobe Lightroom" data-uuid="f1a9591b-9672-36c2-bcb5-5f9658b7c2ee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Adobe</div></figure><p>A new masking panel should help you keep these masks organized. If you&#39;re using one of the desktop apps, you can move the panel around. In addition, you can name each mask to help keep track of what you&#39;re doing. You&#39;ll be able to preview masks in a variety of different ways with the help of overlay visualizations Adobe brought over from Photoshop.</p><p>Elsewhere, Adobe wanted to ensure the tools were available across apps and devices. It says the AI-powered tools work just as well on mobile devices as they do on desktop, while it&#39;s bringing range masks from ACR and Lightroom Classic to Lightroom&#39;s desktop and mobile apps. The company&#39;s also promising better in-app support to help you get the most out of all these tools, such as a step-by-step tutorial in Lightroom.</p><p>The feature parity means that no matter which device or app you prefer for image editing, you should have access to the same tools. These masking upgrades will be available in ACR, Lightroom and Lightroom Classic starting on October 26th. Adobe says its Research and Design Research teams are working on more AI-powered tools and other improvements it plans to announce in the near future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/adobe-camera-raw-lightroom-classic-mask-features-ai-160056644.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49b39819-5d37-41e1-8cc9-6cce127f788a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 16:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632840280</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T14:44:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bcedf10-2068-11ec-afd7-f6730c12cb32" width="1507" height="1004" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6bcedf10-2068-11ec-afd7-f6730c12cb32" width="1507" height="1004" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adobe]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mask features in Adobe Lightroom]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mask features in Adobe Lightroom]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's 'New World' MMORPG is finally here]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After four <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-new-world-mmo-delay-september-28-203855352.html">delays</a> spanning nearly a year and a half of missed release dates, <em>New World</em> is finally here.

DICE and EA have <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-briefing-progression-and-cosmetics?isLocalized=true">revealed</a> the open beta for the massive-scale team shooter will take place between October 8th and October 9th.

It might give you a feel for the game, though, and could help you decide whether or not it&#39;s worth $60 (on PC and older consoles) or $70 (PS5 and Xbox Series X/S). If nothing else, this suggests the developers are confident enough in the game to give everyone a brief sample.</p><div id="062cb0e394ce4aaf8d3f2ea145bb18f7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdA6V5PIEFw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-open-beta-date-155043441.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52beba4b-5bf1-4843-80e3-8345eba7ca9a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 28 Sep 2021 15:50:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1632854574</ingested><modified>2021-09-28T18:42:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9e57e870-2070-11ec-b46f-8efa57f5c42d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9e57e870-2070-11ec-b46f-8efa57f5c42d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DICE/EA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Battlefield 2042' Orbital map from open beta]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Battlefield 2042' Orbital map from open beta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix's latest mobile games have nothing to do with its shows]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix"><ins>Netflix</ins></a> is expanding its library of mobile games, but they&#39;re still only available in a few countries for now.
