He added that YouTube removes almost 10 million videos each quarter, “the majority of which don’t even reach 10 views.”</p><p>Facebook recently made a similar argument about content on its platform. The social network published a report last week that claimed that the most popular posts are memes and other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html"><ins>non-political</ins></a> content. And, faced with criticism over its handling of COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vaccine-misinformation-policies-170012241.html"><ins>vaccine misinformation</ins></a>, the company has argued that vaccine misinformation isn’t representative of the kind of content most users see.</p><p>Both Facebook and YouTube have come under particular scrutiny for their policies around health misinformation during the pandemic. Both platforms have well over a billion users, which means that even a small fraction of content can have a far-reaching impact. And both platforms have so far declined to disclose details about how vaccine and health misinformation spreads or how many users are encountering it. Mahon also said that removing misinformation is only one aspect of the company’s approach. YouTube is also working on “ratcheting up information from trusted sources and reducing the spread of videos with harmful misinformation.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-covid-19-misinformation-takedowns-201041091.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7d891337-3285-46ce-932f-4f90933639f9</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 20:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629921949</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T20:06:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b414f570-05d8-11ec-9bf9-59be78420f14" width="4751" height="3167" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b414f570-05d8-11ec-9bf9-59be78420f14" width="4751" height="3167" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The YouTube video app is seen on various digital devices on 28 March, 2017.

Chaos theory presents classic moments from the film franchise, but with a twist, playing out &quot;what if&quot; scenarios.

This won&#39;t suddenly drag the game into the next-gen console era, but the improved frame rate should make it that much easier to dodge charging robots and line up bow shots.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-release-date-193911645.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d38aaedb-d832-4f22-9853-30e33ed1b628</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:39:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629920354</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T19:39:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e7d327a0-05d9-11ec-97fb-18993fcd6f6d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e7d327a0-05d9-11ec-97fb-18993fcd6f6d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Guerilla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aloy in 'Horizon Forbidden West']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aloy in 'Horizon Forbidden West']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Portal shooter 'Splitgate' launches Season 0, a bigger, better beta]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.splitgate.com/"><em>Splitgate</em></a><em>, </em>an FPS that combines the best of classic Quake multiplayer and <em>Portal</em>, is an unlikely shooter success story. It reached an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-10-million-downloads-100924991.html">astounding 10 million downloads </a>during its open beta last month, when it made its way to consoles and unveiled cross-platform play. And to celebrate that success, today developer 1047 Games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-10-million-downloads-100924991.html">launched its next beta phase</a>: Season 0.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;In the span of a month, our servers went from supporting 4,000 players at once to 175,000 players!&quot; <em>Splitgate </em>creator and 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx wrote on the PlayStation blog. &quot;All in all, our servers had some growing pains, so we had to implement short-term solutions to prevent back-end crashes.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7d8355b3defe486dbb30122f5ee506f3"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5XKcTM_NM8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Given the influx of new users, Proulx says he chose to delay the game&#39;s official launch and extend the beta phase. Existing players can expect a slew of new content in Season 0, including Karman Station, a new map, as well as a new Infection gameplay mode. There&#39;s also a Season 0 Battle Pass and plenty of new gear to pick up. They have to support a free-to-play game somehow, right?&nbsp;</p><p>After spending more than 10 hours in the previous <em>Splitgate</em> beta, it&#39;s easy to see why the game has caught on so quickly. It combines solid shooter mechanics with something entirely new: The ability to place portals around the map, which you can use to teleport or take out enemies. If anything, it&#39;s a welcome respite from the flood of Battle Royale titles on the market.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Splitgate</em> doesn&#39;t have an official launch date yet, the beta is pretty stable in my experience. Proulx says 1047 Games is also work on a map editor, as well as additional maps, weapons and other items in the future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-season-0-beta-launch-193849912.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">51b65339-73b8-4ffa-a32e-fdf23c158624</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:38:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629920373</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T19:39:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/42c24f50-05db-11ec-bbff-3267338bd3bf" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/42c24f50-05db-11ec-bbff-3267338bd3bf" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Portal shooter &#39;Splitgate&#39; launches Season 0, a bigger, better beta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga' will arrive in spring 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We haven&#39;t heard much about <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em> since TT Games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-delayed-indefinitely-162934202.html">delayed it indefinitely</a> back in April.

XCOM developer Firaxis has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz8Vw5tOf5M">unveiled</a><em>Marvel&#39;s Midnight Suns</em>, a turn-based role-playing game based on the Midnight Sons team from 1990s crossover issues.

Game lead Jake Solomon told <em>Polygon</em> in an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22641096/marvels-midnight-suns-is-the-next-game-from-the-xcom-team">interview</a> that <em>Midnight Suns</em> shares &quot;zero mechanics&quot; with the XCOM series. You&#39;ll play missions with up to three other heroes as you develop The Hunter&#39;s powers. When you&#39;re not in combat, an open-world area will help you form bonds with fellow heroes. And instead of the paranoia and fear that drive XCOM, you&#39;re rolling into battle with confidence — there&#39;s no permanent character death, for starters.</p><p>This is something of a gamble when many Marvel appearances have involved more conventional brawlers and fighting games. Firaxis has a strong track record, however, and dipping into the Midnight Sons catalog draw in both long-time Marvel fans as well as those who don&#39;t want to rehash the brand&#39;s most familiar stories.</p><div id="a32014456cdc4f7faf5a27abdc444838"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wz8Vw5tOf5M?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvels-midnight-suns-release-date-trailer-191236120.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6392f10-b089-45cf-bbb2-2f01e98a9acf</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:12:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629918775</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T19:13:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2772f8c0-05d2-11ec-9f3f-dd0b89da79f8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2772f8c0-05d2-11ec-9f3f-dd0b89da79f8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Firaxis Games/2K]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Marvel's Midnight Suns' from Firaxis]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Marvel's Midnight Suns' from Firaxis]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Special-edition 'Halo Infinite' Xbox Series X and controller arrive on November 15th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-december-8th-launch-date-134031534.html"><em>Halo Infinite </em>release date</a>, Microsoft made a couple of other Halo-related announcements at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-how-to-watch-geoff-keighley-152019558.html">Gamescom&#39;s Opening Night Live event</a>.

In its place is<em> Saints Row</em>, a reboot of the series with a back-to-basics focus on ground-level crime and violence. In the seven years since <em>Gat out of Hell</em> was released (we’re not counting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agents_of_Mayhem"><em>Agents of Mayhem</em></a>), the world has moved on, and so too must <em>Saints Row</em>.</p><h3><strong>Welcome to the Weird West</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/32a73e80-05ba-11ec-baff-fc981a5d30ae" alt="Image from Saints Row (2022)" data-uuid="ca96d74e-accd-3240-b6cb-51ae30f05a20"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>The new game is called Saints Row (which we&#39;re told has no subtitle, despite the repeated use of the &quot;Self Made&quot; tagline even on the box art), and is set in Santo Ileso (Spanish speakers, does that pun work for you?), a stand in for America’s Four Corners region which the developers are calling the “weird west.” There are Route 66 signs scattered across the landscape and the desert that surrounds the city, with its patchy grass and tall mesas, looks a lot like Arizona. The neon-strewn casino district (El Dorado) seems to be inspired by those found in Albuquerque. And the financial area, at least from the trailers (and to my British eyes) seems to have been pulled from downtown Santa Fe.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Santo Ileso is made up of nine individual districts with each one designed to use a different traversal method. Running and driving will work best in some regions, while players are encouraged to fly a wingsuit off the top of the financial district’s skyscrapers to cover long distances. Or you can steal a VTOL-equipped craft and just make merry havoc all over the city as you go. The game was built in a brand new, as-yet unannounced engine and these new environments are designed to take advantage of the power that next-gen consoles — if we can still call them that — can offer.</p><p>The developers say that <em>Saints Row’s</em> focus is, at least early in the game, going to focus on the material concerns of its young crew. These disaffected millennials turn to crime to, for instance, put food on their table, feel part of a community and pay off their student loans. Chief creative officer Jim Boone says that it’s, broadly, a “contemporary” millennial “power fantasy.” It’s only later that the game’s focus switches to the sort of empire-building that, in the previous series, eventually saw your character <em>becoming president</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/485eac30-05bb-11ec-bfdf-20830d57473c" alt="Cover art for Saints Row (2022)" data-uuid="5b2b708f-2827-3cd4-a906-44321341455f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>As the game progresses, players can buy property and businesses which opens up new game modes and levels. You can choose where to put those businesses, too, like putting a garbage collection site in the middle of the financial district. The choices you make here will, for instance, engender resistance if you start putting toxic waste next to wherever the one percenters live and work. And, as you take over more of the city, the bigger your power base will grow.</p><p>The storyline sees your ragtag quartet encounter three distinct gangs, each of which owns a chunk of Santo Ileso. The Panteros, for instance, are a bunch of muscle-car enthusiasts who try to use their superior strength to defeat you in combat. Marshall Defense Industries, meanwhile, is a local weapons developer with its own mercenary army equipped with a range of sci-fi weapons and superior marksmanship. Then there are the Idols, a group of Kawaii Cyberpunk Anarchists wearing light-up cat ear helmets who overwhelm you with numbers in a fight.</p><h3><strong>Meet the new boss</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/89d72630-05b9-11ec-bfb4-fcbcdb6e022e" alt="Images of the Saints Row cast" data-uuid="92355e48-326b-3052-ad3b-9c6ec26e7265"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>As far as we know, references to Steelport, the 3rd Street Saints, Johnny Gat, Kenzie and anything else from the prior series are gone. Or, at least, will be relegated to the odd, deeply buried easter egg for die-hard fans to root out while they’re immersed in this new world. In their place is a trio of characters that work to support your player’s unnamed and customizable protagonist.</p><p>There’s Eli (pictured, 2nd from right), an MBA student who works as the team’s planner, speaking in the language of startups, investment and business. Then there’s Neenah (pictured, right), the team’s driver, who had aspirations of becoming an anthropologist but got sucked into working as a mechanic for Los Panteros. Rounding out the quartet (of which you are the fourth member) is Kevin (pictured, left), a topless thrill-seeking DJ who, like his fellow Idols, loves wearing a Kawaii Cyberpunk helmet and wreaking havoc.</p><p>The player character is, as before, infinitely customizable — although it’s not clear how broad those options are. Deep Silver says that you’ll have access to the “most advanced suite” of customization tools ever seen in an open-world game.</p><p>One of the questions raised in the roundtable with the game’s developers was that of cultural appropriation. The six people made available for interview were all middle-aged white men, creating a game set in a region where a significant proportion of the population is Latinx or Hispanic. Creative director Jim Boone said that diversity was important, and there was an explicit focus on making the team producing the game as diverse as the characters in it.</p><h3><strong>Inspiration</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/587066a0-05ba-11ec-bfed-4bb40da54c18" alt="Images taken from promotional material for &#39;Saints Row&#39; (2022)" data-uuid="8d94ecf7-6fdc-3074-bed5-34db4561a49b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>In terms of what we can expect from the new title, Boone said that some of the major inspirations for this film came from the cinema. He cited three titles: <em>John Wick</em>, <em>Baby Driver </em>and <em>Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbes and Shaw </em>as key influences. From the first, you will be able to spot some of the brutality in the combat and some of the melee takedown moves are cribbed from the film’s action sequences. The experience of driving has been pulled from the second, while the third’s penchant for over-the-top action helped provide a baseline for how stunts would work in the new game.</p><p>There will also be a broad degree of <em>Fast and Furious</em>-inspired vehicle customization in which every playable ride can be fixed up. The desert that surrounds Santo Ileso, for instance, has plenty of rough terrain that can be used to crest dunes and chase or evade your enemies. Consequently, players can even jury-rig the game’s garbage truck as a heavy-duty off-road vehicle.</p><h3><strong>Playing together</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/586a9a40-05ba-11ec-bf25-74a1c784a30f" alt="Images taken from promotional material for &#39;Saints Row&#39; (2022)" data-uuid="fa623bcf-3d81-3e1c-bd6c-8522f7861133"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>Saints Row is coming to the PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox One and, for PC gamers, the Epic Games Store. The developers said that cross-platform co-op will be available from the start, and you can play the entire campaign through “untethered co-op play.” One thing that was mentioned was the ability to “prank” your co-op partner, stymying their progress in order to advance your own.</p><h3><strong>The elephant in the room</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/58968c40-05ba-11ec-9bdf-8b76406855fe" alt="Images taken from promotional material for &#39;Saints Row&#39; (2022)" data-uuid="9b78a593-3cd0-3bbf-991b-495764b67891"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>There are more than a few reasons why Volition chose to make <em>Saints Row</em>, rather than <em>Saints Row V</em>. Boone said that the classic series of games were very much “of [their] time,” with tastes and attitudes having moved on. And it can’t have helped that the company’s last attempt at a reboot,<em> Agents of Mayhem</em>, received lukewarm reviews and poor sales, forcing Volition to make layoffs in its wake.</p><p>Lead mission designer Jeremy Bernstein added that the original story, by the end of <em>Gat out of Hell</em>, had burned through all of its narrative runway. When your player protagonist has conquered Earth, ascended to Godhood and escaped hell, there’s not much you can do to top it. Bernstein compared the problem to the James Bond movies circa <em>Moonraker,</em> saying that once you’ve done <em>James Bond In Space</em>, the gritty realism of <em>For Your Eyes Only</em> is one hell of a tonal shift.</p><h3><strong>But is it still fun?</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5893cd20-05ba-11ec-90bb-553c5c64ecfb" alt="Images taken from promotional material for &#39;Saints Row&#39; (2022)" data-uuid="f5f299f0-caee-3fa7-bdcd-6c1cedc4be12"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>The team wanted to assure us that while the juvenilia that marked the previous series was gone, the irreverence would remain. Bernstein said that it would be pretty much impossible to make a “grimdark Saints Row game” for obvious reasons. And while the developers didn’t elaborate much on silly weapons, like the Penetrator (<em>Saints Row The Third’s</em> infamous Dildo Lance) and the Dubstep Gun (from <em>Saints Row IV</em>), they said one or two had made their way into the title. You’ll also, once again, be able to ragdoll yourself into traffic under the auspices of committing insurance fraud.</p><p>If I have a concern, it’s that I always found Saints Row a more enjoyable franchise than<em> GTA</em> because of the emphasis on fun. The challenges soon became repetitive, but the breadth of ways in which you could complete a mission (and the fun weapons) helped smooth the edges. The emphasis here, so far, has been on the difference between the new game and its predecessors, with less discussion on how fun it all is. Maybe that’s just savvy marketing, and the new title will be just as fun and silly as franchise diehards are hoping. But it’s something that I’d like to see more of, or else I’d get the feeling that the title may lose the one thing people are so desperate for it to have.</p><p><em>Saints Row</em> is scheduled to launch on February 25th, 2022 for current and next-generation consoles.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/saints-row-reboot-2022-200040315.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">38a3152e-137f-4198-a5af-bc3ed1ab9596</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 18:06:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629914776</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T18:06:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fe5d78b0-05b9-11ec-a9d8-7a1bc4f38fb4" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fe5d78b0-05b9-11ec-a9d8-7a1bc4f38fb4" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Deep Silver / Volition]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of combat taken from Saints Row (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Saints Row' (2022) Combat ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marvel’s ‘What If…?’ turns grim in its third episode with mixed results]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains major spoilers for episode three of What If…?</em></p><p>After two fun, zippy stories that focused on the idea of swapping one character for another, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/what%20if"><em>What If…?</em></a> pivots to a darker outcome in its third installment. This time, the entire Avengers slate is wiped clean, with Nick Fury left to sort out the mess. It’s a nod to the animated series’ comic inspiration, plus a sign that the show isn’t willing to settle into a routine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The original comic book, also called <em>What If?</em>, often see-sawed between silly and serious scenarios, like what would happen if Spider-Man had joined the Fantastic Four, Gwen Stacy had lived or if Dazzler became Galactus’ herald. With no need to follow continuity, the creative teams of each issue in the anthology were free to take the story wherever they wanted, often in dark turns that ultimately illustrated why the original timeline was the best.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ce9a9ff0-05cc-11ec-bbff-5bf0580484cf" alt="Marvel&#39;s What If?" data-uuid="820e02b6-31a2-38ca-bf87-f77038f9e091"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>However, the <em>What If…?</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/P0ab6Y">Disney+</a> series has taken the opposite tack, showcasing one scenario where things are largely the same level of good and bad (for Captain Carter) and another where events went decidedly better (unless you’re Peter Quill). It’s likely the creators didn’t want to immediately scare away casual viewers with anything too grim, keeping the stories as light and breezy as their cinematic inspirations.</p><p>The third episode doesn’t just change this course by featuring a more pessimistic scenario, however, it also steps away from telling us upfront why things are like this. The first two episodes had Uatu explicitly pointing out the moment of divergence. This time around, we know something is different — the prospective Avengers are being murdered — but exactly how and why is a mystery.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/94fb6610-facf-11eb-9fff-ce21547852b7" alt="The Watcher" data-uuid="bf0431ba-f891-3cc4-8f70-433799625d62"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>It actually makes for a more interesting show because rather than playing a half-hour game of “spot the difference,” we become engaged in speculation about why this is happening. We know things would be vastly altered if Tony Stark or Bruce Banner dies, but now we get to play detective, plumbing our knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for suspects and motives. Instead of a straight-up adventure tale, this episode was a murder mystery.</p><p>Whether it’s a <em>successful</em> mystery, I’m not entirely sure. Hank Pym is not someone I had considered as a suspect, even with his distaste for SHIELD and the Starks in the main timeline. The point of divergence turns out to be Hope Pym joining SHIELD and being killed on a mission, which leaves Hank alone and bitter. Why he chooses to kill five uninvolved strangers in an attempt to hurt Nick Fury is murky at best. I’d originally pegged the murder of the Avengers as a Hydra plot, which would have actually help shore up the retcon from <em>Captain America and the Winter Soldier</em> of SHIELD being taken over by Hydra — it’s rarely explored why Hydra let the Avengers get as far as they did in the main timeline, rather than strangling that potential opposition in its cradle.</p><div id="ed0e84c664ad4df39cf088d0e8ba58e6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wzjQsZ_Wr50?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Ultimately, the point of the episode is to set the viewer up for even darker stories to come — at least one future story is focused on zombies, a nod to the rather successful line of “Marvel Zombies” comics from over a decade ago. It also does some tidying up for the main continuity as well, reminding the viewers that three of the early <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel%20cinematic%20universe">MCU</a> films took place in the same week, and that Loki is <em>still</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/loki-disney-plus-premiere-review-160028040.html">a jerk</a>.

But it turns out Google didn&#39;t appreciate its ability to rip music out of YouTube. The company has sent a cease and desist letter to Groovy Bot&#39;s owners, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure"><em>The Verge reports</em></a>, asking them to shut down within seven days. They&#39;re not putting up a fight: Groovy Bot will officially go offline on August 30th.</p><p>A YouTube spokesperson noted that Groovy Bot violated its terms of service, particularly because it modified the way YouTube worked and charge for the privilege. If Groovy Bot were merely free, it may have been able to live on. But it also offers a premium subscription starting at $3.99 a month, which unlocks a slew of useful features.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The bot is currently installed on over 16 million Discord servers and has reportedly amassed <a href="https://tinelund.dk/groovy-bot-the-best-music-bot-for-discord-groovy-15/">more than 250 million users</a>. Groovy Bot owner Nik Ammerlaan tells <em>The Verge</em> that around 98 percent of played tracks came through YouTube (naturally, because it&#39;s free). With one bot down, there&#39;s a good chance Google is also targeting the more popular Rhythm music bot. While the owner of that service claims it&#39;s not shutting down, its days are clearly numbered.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/groovy-bot-discord-youtube-music-145236619.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0f924253-cbec-41bd-a997-43aed51096fa</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 14:52:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629914949</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T18:09:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/43be4240-f516-11eb-a7e3-a5fa5a79637e" width="2846" height="1792" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/43be4240-f516-11eb-a7e3-a5fa5a79637e" width="2846" height="1792" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sabrina Bracher via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Young man wearing headset and play computer video games online - Home isolated for coronavirus outbreak]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Young man wearing headset and play computer video games online - Home isolated for coronavirus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[President Biden is meeting with Apple, Google and Microsoft on cybersecurity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US has suffered a flurry of major cyberattacks targeting everyone from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solarwinds-hackers-targeted-federal-prosecutors-160655082.html">federal prosecutors</a> through to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jbs-cyberattack-meat-factories-usa-canada-australia-171823530.html">meat suppliers</a>, and the White House hopes some discussions with key companies will produce some long-term security solutions. The <em>Washington Post</em><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/25/white-house-cybersecurity-summit-apple-amazon/">reports</a> that President Biden, certain cabinet members and relevant security officials are <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2021/08/25/background-press-call-by-senior-administration-officials-on-the-presidents-upcoming-cybersecurity-meeting/">holding</a> talks on August 25th with tech giants ADP, Amazon, Apple, Google, IBM and Microsoft to see how they can help bolster cybersecurity.</p><p>While the spate of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/colonial-pipeline-restarts-operations-060635370.html">ransomware attacks</a> will be on the agenda, a senior Biden administration official said the White House wanted to tackle the &quot;root causes&quot; of cybersecurity issues. This included addressing a wide range of vulnerabilities, instituting &quot;good operational practices&quot; and hiring more security workers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The conversations will also involve financial and insurance giants (including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Travelers) as well as educational organizations like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-28-code-org-frozen-starwars-courses.html">Code.org</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-10-gm-and-girls-who-code-partner-for-after-school-stem-program.html">Girls Who Code</a>. While the Biden meeting is at the center of the discussions, the chats with cabinet members and officials are billed as &quot;informal&quot; sessions that will help establish definitive solutions.</p><p>The White House said the meetups were a recognition that the US needed a &quot;whole-of-nation&quot; cybersecurity strategy involving both the government and private sector. It also promised this wouldn&#39;t be the &quot;last engagement&quot; with companies on security issues. This comes soon after Biden took multiple steps in a bid to improve digital security for vital infrastructure, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/white-house-eo-network-security-010757835.html">issuing an executive order</a> meant to bolster federal security standards and coordination.</p><p>The question, as always, is whether or not the discussions will lead to meaningful action. The meeting with tech firms might help with top-down decision-making, but that won&#39;t matter much unless the other talks also lead to tangible strategy changes. This could be little more than a public relations exercise if the companies don&#39;t (or can&#39;t) commit to specific cybersecurity improvements.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/presdient-biden-cybersecurity-talks-apple-google-microsoft-143505316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02250465-129f-4e0c-ac42-6c6f8fd3c283</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 14:35:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629902107</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T14:35:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7cca0260-057c-11ec-9e2f-6353e32b766f" width="8359" height="5573" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7cca0260-057c-11ec-9e2f-6353e32b766f" width="8359" height="5573" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Drew Angerer via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - AUGUST 24: U.S. President Joe Biden speaks about the situation in Afghanistan in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on August 24, 2021 in Washington, DC.

Users will also be able to send cash to friends as a “birthday gift” with Facebook Pay, which is essentially like any other person-to-person payment in Messenger but adds some new celebratory animations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The app is also adding a new type of mini game to chats with “poll games.” The feature allows friends in group threads to weigh in on lighthearted polls that ask which member of the chat is “most likely” to do something like miss a flight or fight zombies. Both the new birthday effects, poll games, and birthday gifting are rolling out now. Messenger also previewed a new “word effects” feature coming “in the near future” that allows users to pair an emoji with a specific word or phrase in order to trigger an in-chat animation similar to iMessage’s special effects.</p><p>The updates underscore just how much Messenger has changed in its first decade of existence. Originally launched in 2011, the app evolved from a basic chat app to one so bloated with features it’s been redesigned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-facebook-rebuilt-messenger-for-cross-app-chat.html">at least</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-app-redesign-140445037.html">three</a> times in the last two years. It’s been home to many of Facebook’s more ambitious — though not always <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-08-facebook-m-ai-assistant-closure.html">successful</a> — features over the years.</p><p>More recently, Facebook has been weaving Messenger more tightly into its other services by pushing users to link their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-chat-across-instagram-and-messenger-120049504.html">Instagram DMs</a> with their Messenger account. Facebook wants to bring this same kind of “cross-app communication” <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/18/facebook-testing-interoperability-whatsapp/">to WhatsApp</a> as well, though the company hasn’t said much about how or when it could happen. Likewise, it’s still not clear when Messenger will turn on end-to-end encryption as a <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-messenger-end-to-end-encryption-default/">default setting</a>.</p><p>During a call with reporters, Facebook’s Messenger chief Stan Chudnovsky said that the rollout of encryption as a default is moving slowly in part due to the sheer number of features in the messaging app. “We need to rebuild all these features in [an] end-to-end encrypted environment, and make them fully capable,” he said, noting that Messenger is still continuously adding new features. “It&#39;s almost like we are constantly trying to catch up with ourselves.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-10th-anniversary-features-133027577.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">823d19eb-b460-42be-881e-2e9d6537771f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:30:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629914976</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T18:09:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1544f070-0543-11ec-819b-39561b4f9fb1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1544f070-0543-11ec-819b-39561b4f9fb1" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Messenger is 10.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[facebook messenger 10 years]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[OnlyFans has 'suspended' its ban on sexually explicit content]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OnlyFans&#39; upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/onlyfans-sexually-explicit-content-ban-184819350.html">ban on sexually explicit material</a> appears to be over before it even began.

There’s no doubt the popularity of Apple’s AirPods helped make these headphones a mainstay, but companies’ ability to offer reliable connectivity, great sound and active noise cancellation (ANC) in an increasingly smaller form factor has hastened widespread adoption. You can also get features that used to be reserved for premium models on mid-range devices. Of course, the popularity means that new earbuds are popping up all the time and the list of options is longer than ever. To help, we’ve compiled the best wireless earbuds you can buy right now, including noteworthy features for each selection.</p><h2>Best overall: Sony WF-1000XM4</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/e946df82-c85a-11eb-be66-b32ed77c6949" alt="Sony totally overhauled its true wireless earbuds with a new design, more powerful noise cancellation, improved battery life and more. However, the choice to change to foam tips leads to an awkward fit that could be an issue for some people. The M4 is also more expensive than its predecessor, which wouldn&#x002019;t be a big deal if fit wasn&#x002019;t a concern.

The company’s app gives you the ability to let the M4s do a lot of the adjustments for you based on activity and location.

The company also added ANC via a firmware update in 2020, so these don’t seem outdated by any means.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ge2N6Q" id="dc289929ec3e4d96aadb7812eb119975" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Jabra Elite 75t at Amazon - $150</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/yRmbqv" id="51c0bb97046a4609aabff6bfb521b657" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Jabra Elite 75t at Best Buy - $150</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">52299dcd-39b7-3f30-8524-2c7d79d13daa</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:20:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629897997</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T13:26:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[truewirelessearbuds]]></category><category><![CDATA[anker]]></category><category><![CDATA[sennheiser]]></category><category><![CDATA[airpodspro]]></category><category><![CDATA[earbuds]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[google]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[pixelbuds]]></category><category><![CDATA[soundcore]]></category><category><![CDATA[apple]]></category><category><![CDATA[sony]]></category><category><![CDATA[samsung]]></category><category><![CDATA[wf-1000xm3]]></category><category><![CDATA[elite75t]]></category><category><![CDATA[momentumtruewireless2]]></category><category><![CDATA[feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[jabra]]></category><category><![CDATA[galaxybuds+]]></category><category><![CDATA[truewireless]]></category><category><![CDATA[galaxybudsplus]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[spiritdot2]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8fb896d0-05a3-11ec-bbf5-0b8afea9e12e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8fb896d0-05a3-11ec-bbf5-0b8afea9e12e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The best wireless earbuds you can buy right now]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lucid is offering two variants of its Air Dream Edition luxury EV]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/lucid%20air">Lucid</a> is giving prospective owners of its $169,000 luxury electric sedan the choice between two variants. The<a href="https://www.engadget.com/for-lucids-air-ev-sedan-performance-and-prestige-come-at-a-price-230047964.html"> Air Dream Edition</a> will be available in a &quot;Performance&quot; or &quot;Range&quot; version that ultimately leaves you to decide between speed and real-world driving range. The former promises 1,111 horsepower, which rivals the Tesla Model S Plaid, and can hit 0-60 mph in 2.5 seconds.</p><p>The Dream Edition Range, meanwhile, will deliver 933 horsepower and take 0.2 seconds longer to go from 0-60 mph. Both have a top speed of 168 mph, cost $169,000 (before factoring in federal tax credits or other incentives) and are expected to ship later this year. You&#39;ll be able to identify each variant with the &quot;P&quot; or &quot;R&quot; letter on their respective badges. The company previously revealed that it only planned to build about 500 units of the Dream Edition.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Notably, Lucid is still in the process of confirming the cars&#39; official range with the US Environmental Protection Agency. In real-world tests, the company says a pair of Dream Edition Range models travelled 445 miles on a single charge. The journey saw the cars venture from LA to San Francisco at highway speeds via central California, and then back across the San Francisco Bay to Lucid’s global headquarters. Upon arrival, Lucid claims the the cars displayed 30 miles and 72 miles of charge remaining (for totals of 475 and 517 miles).&nbsp;</p><p>The EV maker is currently reaching out to those who put down $7,500 to reserve the Air Dream Edition to confirm their chosen configuration. Lucid <a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/23/lucid-10000-reservations-air-electric-luxury-sedan-not-bad/">said</a> in June that it had received over 10,000 reservations across all Air models, which — along with the top-of-the-range Dream Edition — includes the base edition, the Air Touring and Air Grand Touring.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-dream-edition-variants-131507797.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8617ebc1-e8ae-44ee-9b7b-1c9c5f190548</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:15:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629915022</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T18:10:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/50937f80-05a1-11ec-b7bd-4e5de0413928" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/50937f80-05a1-11ec-b7bd-4e5de0413928" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lucid Motors]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Lucid Air]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Lucid Air]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fitbit’s Charge 5 packs an ECG and stress response sensor]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The trickle-down of features from Fitbit’s higher-end wearables to its everyday fitness trackers continues with the Charge 5. This new edition of the device is packing both ECG and EDA sensors, both of which were first found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-review-eda-stress-blood-oxygen-specs-price-130048259.html">higher-end Sense</a>, to better help you monitor your heart health and stress. Charge 5 also gets a few quality-of-life improvements <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-4-review-120052713.html">compared to its predecessor</a>, including a new body that’s 10 percent thinner and a new color AMOLED display with an always-on option.</p><p>But the real point of this new tech is to integrate the Fitbit into your daily health routines as something more than just a tracker. The ECG sensor will, naturally, help you check your heart’s electrical activity and check for signs of atrial fibrillation. The EDA, or Electrodermal Activity sensor (itself a fancier term for Galvanic Skin Response) is designed to measure the perspiration of your hands, which can be a marker for stress. As with the Sense, users can then be coached through a stress-reduction session if their stats get too aggressive.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fa9df64fb38647148bf043b8e114523a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ozWbsAayGEE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Fitbit is also looking to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-deepak-chopra-mindful-method-available-now-140036885.html">bolster</a> its $10-per-month <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-28-fitbit-premium.html">Premium offering</a> to encourage more of its hardware users to sign up to a monthly subscription. That includes a new Daily Readiness Score, which sounds a lot like Garmin’s Body Battery calculation, which will examine how ready you are to work out. It’ll do that by looking at your heart rate variability, recent sleep schedule and activity to judge if you should hit the treadmill or the couch that day.</p><p>Premium will also get a new collection of workouts from Les Mills to help coach you through the workout du jour. In addition, Fitbit is partnering with Calm, and Premium users will get access to “30 pieces of Calm content in seven languages,” with users able to run an EDA scan at the same time as listening to a Calm-created mindfulness session. Or they will be, since the material is expected to arrive at some point in September.</p><p>The <a href="https://bit.ly/3B5T0Yc">Fitbit Charge 5</a> is available to pre-order today, and will cost $179.95 complete with six months of Fitbit Premium thrown in.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-ecg-eda-sensors-heart-stress-i-h-130058156.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff0f76d5-7a74-408d-b887-9841ab0df203</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:00:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629896062</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T12:54:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a621b330-05a2-11ec-b73b-46d210701afd" width="1050" height="700" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a621b330-05a2-11ec-b73b-46d210701afd" width="1050" height="700" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fitbit]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the new Fitbit Charge 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fitbit Charge 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Zoom's latest update includes gesture-activated reactions on iPad]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-delays-hq-office-return-until-2022-amid-covid-19-surge-055819058.html">businesses</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-delays-office-reopening-plans-211711342.html">delay</a> the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-return-to-office-092520216.html"> return</a> to the office, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Zoom">Zoom</a> looks set to keep thriving in a hybrid work setup. To build on that momentum, the communications platform is introducing a raft of new updates that span meetings, chat and even phone calls.</p><p>The neatest new feature rolling out today are gesture-activated reactions for iPad. Now, when you raise your hand or give a thumbs up during a meeting it will automatically show the corresponding icon in your video panel. The broader &quot;non-verbal feedback&quot; function needs to be activated first.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For now, &quot;Raise Hand&quot; and &quot;Thumbs Up&quot; are the only gesture-supported reactions, though that could change in the future. The others are &quot;slow down,&quot; &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no,&quot; while the standard emoji also include clapping hands, heart, tears of joy, open mouth and party popper (celebration). The gist of non-verbal feedback is to allow participants to communicate with the host while maintaining the flow of a meeting. Using physical gestures may help novice Zoomers to express themselves without the fear of mishaps.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5160a00-0591-11ec-bf77-4b7a378f8eff" style="height:4365;width:5310;" alt="Zoom" data-uuid="934bb30f-855c-37aa-8c74-57a4e28b30f7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zoom</div></figure><p>As mentioned, this latest update is a biggie, but how much of it you notice depends on the parts of Zoom you actually use. For Meetings, there&#39;s a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zooms-new-focus-mode-is-designed-to-block-student-distractions-082533097.html">Focus Mode</a> that only shows participants the host and the content they are sharing. As its name implies, the feature is designed to cut out distractions. You can now also seamlessly transition a meeting from mobile to desktop and vice versa. Plus, admins can limit screen sharing when a guest joins a meeting.</p><p>In addition, Zoom is making the chat sidebar easier to navigate with public and private channel markers. Now, the display will generally show fewer chats and channels per group, but you&#39;ll be able to expand it to see more activity. Zoom is also once again moving the search function to the left side. Lastly, you can try out the new admin experience — which puts a bunch of management controls in one place — before it becomes the default in October.</p><p>As for calls, Zoom Phone users are getting more usage metrics, group call monitoring privileges and a privacy feature that prevents others from accessing shared line calls.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zooms-update-gesture-reactions-130053956.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fd926609-65d7-4103-89ee-6d644044fe60</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:00:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629888850</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T10:56:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/798e04b0-0591-11ec-9e9b-8b3f295fc1fc" width="1819" height="1360" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/798e04b0-0591-11ec-9e9b-8b3f295fc1fc" width="1819" height="1360" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Otter's transcription tech now supports Microsoft Teams, Google Meet and Webex]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Otter has a solution for that pile-up of virtual meetings in your calendar.
