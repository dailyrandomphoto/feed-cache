Engineers reactivated the Advanced Camera for Surveys on November 7th, but they&#39;ll need to verify the device&#39;s output this week before they enable any other affected components.</p><p>The problems began October 23rd, when NASA noticed that instruments weren&#39;t receiving sync messages from Hubble&#39;s control unit. Those communication problems continued for two days, prompting the emergency shutdowns. The space agency can&#39;t revive Hubble quickly — rapid power and temperature changes risk shortening the telescope&#39;s lifespan.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The failure is the second in 2021 to prompt an extended shutdown (the June payload flaw prompted NASA to invoke a month-long &quot;coma&quot; in July), and that&#39;s on top of previous problems. NASA had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-24-nasa-hubble-gyroscope-fix.html">restart Hubble&#39;s gyroscopes</a> in 2018, for instance. The mounting problems suggest the 31-year-old observer is running out of time, and there&#39;s no Space Shuttle available if a hardware replacement is necessary.</p><p>Astronomers might not be too worried. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-james-webb-space-telescope-launch-date-145148575.html">James Webb Space Telescope</a> is due to launch December 18th and may serve as a spiritual successor to Hubble, even if it&#39;s not focusing on the same wavelengths. Hubble is also contributing to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-dead-early-galaxies-210407505.html">significant discoveries</a> to this day. In that sense, Hubble is effectively signalling that it&#39;s ready to pass the torch.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hubble-telescope-recovering-from-system-failure-151249317.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">abe5580f-be6b-48f4-bfe3-d9213c3d298b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 15:12:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636557734</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T15:22:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5bdef860-4232-11ec-b7ef-b800825176dd" width="3069" height="2039" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5bdef860-4232-11ec-b7ef-b800825176dd" width="3069" height="2039" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ho New / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A wide view of the Hubble Space Telescope, locked down in the cargo bay, is seen in this NASA handout image taken May 14, 2009 from inside the Earth-orbiting Space Shuttle Atlantis.

We review smart speakers, robotic vacuums and Instant Pots all year long, and for the holiday season we’ve compiled a list of our recent favorites in the home tech space that will make excellent gifts. And your giftee doesn’t have to be tech savvy to use all of them either — plenty of our recommendations amount to baby steps into the smart home world for those who would rather start off slow.</p><h2>Instant Pot Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/68d5ed00-422b-11ec-9ffa-1cb9873c1aac" alt="Instant Pot Pro for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.

Designed for avid cook, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Instant Pot Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3FxXPN7">Instant Pot Pro</a> brings several key upgrades over previous models. The inner pot has an extra thick bottom that lets you heat it on the stove, plus handles that make it easier to lift. It has 28 customizable programs for different foods, and there are five favorite buttons that you can assign to frequently cooked meals. It also has steam release reminder alerts with 5- and 10-minute pre-sets.

It’s a luxury purchase, for sure, but it’s well worth the price for serious home cooks.

It’s a great gift for both homeowners and renters, as you don’t need to hardwire it. Battery life is anywhere from one to six months depending on how active it is (it’s shorter if you live on a busy street, for example). The Doorbell notifies them whenever there’s a person, animal or vehicle near the front door. It can also let them know when a package has been placed, which is great for pre-empting theft. In addition, it offers three hours of event video history for free, with the option to purchase more space through a Nest Aware subscription.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/vnjvkO" id="b485f059051746e195fea7a0cf3d32e5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Nest Doorbell Battery at Best Buy - $180</a><h2>Google Nest Hub (2nd gen)</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/68cf0f30-422b-11ec-be6e-34dc44ff22f2" alt="Nest Hub (2nd gen) for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.

The two are designed to work together: anytime someone rings the doorbell, the camera view of who’s at the front door will show up on the Nest Hub’s screen. Even without the doorbell, however, the smart display is a great device to have around the home — especially if your loved one already uses the Google Assistant. It works as a digital photo frame and they can use it to watch YouTube and Netflix. It can also make calls via Google Duo and offers recipe videos along with step-by-step cooking instructions.

It’s a problem that <a href="https://www.omorpho.fit/">Omorpho</a> is looking to tackle with its new Gravity Sportswear, which spreads the weight across the garment. The rationale for this, and the use of what it’s calling MicroLoad Spheres which are dotted all over like Michael B.

He is joined by a group of former Nike employees which have worked to build the clothes and finesse this system of weighting clothes. The process of developing the garments has reportedly taken more than three years, and uses premium fabrics in the construction. And there are a number of big-name athletes pitching the clothes, including Julio Jones and Annie Kunz.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The entire collection, which includes long and short-sleeve tops, vests and leggings, is available to buy from <a href="https://www.omorpho.fit/">Omorpho&#39;s</a> website today.

Today the company is massively updating how you block another user on its platform, giving you the ability to do so yourself for the first time. Before now, you had to contact customer service to get the job done, but now you can complete the task on Spotify app from a desktop or mobile device.&nbsp;</p><p>Users have been clamoring for a way to directly block others for quite some time. In 2018, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-18-spotify-slowly-warms-up-to-user-blocking-feature.html">designated a block feature</a> as a &quot;good idea,&quot; although it wasn&#39;t officially on a product roadmap and no timeline for arrival was given. In 2019, Spotify began allowing users to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-22-spotify-dont-play-artist-feature-ios-android.html">block artists</a> they never wanted to hear with a &quot;Don&#39;t play this artist&quot; option.

As you might expect, there&#39;s an &quot;Unblock&quot; option should you ever change your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Spotify says the introduction of a direct blocking feature is part of its ongoing mission to give users the best experience it can while fostering a safe environment for them to listen to music and podcasts.

Since the litter is so efficient at keeping odor away, we’ve found that we actually use less litter than before, which helps reduce waste. Plus, our cat seems to like it too.

Back then, the commission decided after a lengthy investigation that the tech giant favored its own comparison shopping services and unfairly directed users to its own products over those of its rivals&#39;. That $2.8 billion fine is just a tiny fraction of Alphabet&#39;s (Google&#39;s parent company) <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-08/alphabet-hits-2-trillion-market-value-after-71-rally-this-year?sref=10lNAhZ9">$2 trillion valuation</a>, but it was the biggest financial penalty the commission has ever handed out.</p><p>&nbsp;The court said in a statement:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;The General Court finds that, by favoring its own comparison shopping service on its general results pages through more favorable display and positioning, while relegating the results from competing comparison services in those pages by means of ranking algorithms, Google departed from competition on the merits.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>While the General Court mostly <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/google-loses-battle-with-eu-as-court-upholds-2017-order.html">sided</a> with the commission&#39;s findings that Google&#39;s actions had harmful effects on comparison shopping, it disagreed with one element of the EU&#39;s case. As <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-loses-eu-shopping-ads-case-appeal-11636539480"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> noted, it said that regulators weren&#39;t able to prove that the company&#39;s conduct harmed competition among general search engines.</p><p>Back when it appealed the EU&#39;s decision, Google argued that the commission ignored the competition it faces in the e-commerce sector from Amazon. The company could appeal the General Court&#39;s decision yet again by taking the case to the EU&#39;s highest court, the European Court of Justice. A spokesperson told <em>The Journal</em>, however, that the company will still have to review the judgment more closely before deciding whether to file another appeal.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-loses-appeal-eu-antitrust-comparison-shopping-125544574.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e1fcef97-c741-4ff7-96d1-548568599aa2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:55:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636548973</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T12:56:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5fb002c0-4220-11ec-b8fc-34d845d91de2" width="5417" height="2928" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5fb002c0-4220-11ec-b8fc-34d845d91de2" width="5417" height="2928" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[PierreOlivierClementMantion via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dublin, Ireland - February 12, 2019: Architectural detail of the Irish headquarters building of the multinational Google on a winter day]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Architectural detail of the Irish headquarters building of the multinational Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Peloton reveals its smart camera for strength training]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You can’t keep a fitness company down.

That changes today with iRobot&#39;s latest Alexa Skill, which taps into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-genius-home-intelligence-bravaa-040110893.html">company&#39;s Genius software platform</a> to deliver smarter and more conversational voice commands.</p><p>You&#39;ll be able to tell Wi-Fi connected Roombas to clean around specific objects, and you can schedule cleaning jobs without sounding like you&#39;re inputting a computer program. As iRobot CEO Colin Angle tells us, the Alexa Skill is one of the most complex ever created. You can even tie a bunch of commands together, even across iRobots vacuums and Bravaa mop. For example, you can shout &quot;Alexa, tell Roomba to clean my dining room every Sunday at 4PM <em>and</em> then run Bravaa.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Additionally, iRobot&#39;s devices will also be able to use Alexa speakers to send announcements about cleaning jobs. Sure, the company&#39;s app already sends you phone notifications, but it&#39;s easy to miss those if you&#39;re cleaning up the house while Roomba works. iRobot devices can also tap into Alexa&#39;s AI-driven Hunches to start cleaning jobs if it thinks you aren&#39;t home. (Hopefully, there&#39;ll be plenty of control about how exactly that feature works.)</p><p>According to Angle, iRobot has a fundamental belief that you&#39;re supposed to be able to talk to your robots, and &quot;do so in a natural and sophisticated fashion.&quot; When Amazon was first developing Alexa, he says, one of the earliest concepts discussed was being able to use voice commands to control Roombas. Given iRobot&#39;s push towards making its device smarter — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">latest Roomba </a>has enough cameras and processing smarts to detect objects, even dog poop — it was only a matter of time until it focused more on voice support.</p><p>While iRobot&#39;s software platform taps into the maps Roombas create around your floorplans, Angle says the company isn&#39;t sharing any data with Amazon. Similarly, he claims iRobot isn&#39;t learning anything from Amazon either. Still, the two companies had to work together to ensure that a complex string of voice commands could work properly with Alexa. And looking ahead, iRobot plans to add even more features, like the ability to set a Do Not Disturb time for cleaning jobs.</p><p>It&#39;ll be interesting to see how much Roomba customers will actually want to talk with their robots. I&#39;ve used the company&#39;s original Alexa skill since it launched, but I still end up starting cleaning jobs from my phone most of the time. I&#39;m also hoping we&#39;ll eventually see these voice smarts on platforms other than Amazon&#39;s. Angle says the company is working with Google about optimizing its Home skill, but Apple hasn&#39;t been as receptive (at least you can get some <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/01/18/irobot-roomba-siri-control/">Siri support with IFTTT</a>).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-smarter-alexa-skill-voice-commands-120027590.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c75892be-df92-4503-bcf6-babcbd047dc6</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 12:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636518171</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T04:23:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9161d080-41dc-11ec-b7f5-e86006f2e3d9" width="2048" height="1536" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9161d080-41dc-11ec-b7f5-e86006f2e3d9" width="2048" height="1536" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roomba j7+ with Alexa]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roomba j7+ with Alexa]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iOS 15.2 beta introduces nearby AirTag searches and Legacy Contacts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is introducing another way to ensure its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> won&#39;t be used for stalking when iOS 15.2 comes out. According to <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/ios-15-2-airtag-scan/"><em>MacRumors</em></a>, the beta version of the mobile platform that has just come out has a new feature that will let users scan for AirTags that may be tracking their location. At the moment, users can find the feature under the Items tab in the Find My‌ app — all they need to do is tap the &quot;Items That Can Track Me&quot; option to do a scan.&nbsp;</p><p>Any trackable item nearby that belongs to someone else will be detected and show up as an unknown item. Apple will then point users to a set of instructions on how to disable the device that&#39;s being used to track them. While it could put people&#39;s mind at ease, the new feature could also be a double-edged sword. For users that hide AirTags in bikes, other items thieves could steal and even their pets&#39; collars, this could prevent them from catching the culprit and retrieving their property. The feature might work a lot differently, however, by the time iOS 15.2 is ready for wider rollout.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To note, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-privacy-update-193102233.html">updated</a> AirTags to address stalking concerns back in June. It adjusted the time period after which the device would play a sound when separated from its owner from three days to a random time between 8 and 24 hours. This experimental feature is an additional privacy measure.&nbsp;</p><p>Another interesting feature that showed up with the beta version of iOS 15.2 is <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/09/new-features-in-ios-15-beta-2/">Digital Legacy</a>. It will allow users to designate people as Legacy Contacts, who&#39;ll be able to access their account and digital information when they pass away. In the current iteration of the mobile OS, Legacy Contact lives inside Password and Security within the Settings app.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-2-beta-nearby-airtag-scan-legacy-contacts-112524218.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a5c5e486-921d-4765-bbcd-8e21bd19fcfa</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 11:25:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636542840</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T11:14:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/23e93a00-4210-11ec-b5fc-cd87fa0a6ede" width="1600" height="1039" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/23e93a00-4210-11ec-b5fc-cd87fa0a6ede" width="1600" height="1039" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MacRumors]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iOS 15.2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iOS 15.2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK Supreme Court rules in favor of Google in iPhone tracking case]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has escaped the risk of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-30-google-sued-in-the-uk-for-illegal-data-collection.html">lawsuit</a> after violating the privacy of around 5.4 million iPhone users in the UK. The UK’s Supreme Court has ruled that it cannot allow a US-style Class Action suit to be lobbed at the search giant after it deliberately created a workaround to track Safari users. The <a href="https://www.supremecourt.uk/cases/docs/uksc-2019-0213-judgment.pdf">judgment</a>, read by Lord Leggatt, was focused on procedural matters, like the intersection between Google, based in the US, and the UK’s data protection laws. More importantly, however, was the issue of “damage,” and the fact that the claimants — led by consumer rights champion Richard Lloyd — had not established that any material harm had been caused by Google’s workaround.</p><p>The story begins in 2017 with Lloyd, and many others, formed a group called “Google You Owe Us” to attempt to sue the company. It alleged that Google had illegally collected data on iPhone users between June 2011 and February 2012 in violation of UK law. The matter hinged on the fact that Google had deliberately created a workaround to get access to data it was not otherwise entitled to. Lloyd and crew <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-08-google-safari-workaround-uk-lawsuit-dismissed.html">lost at the High Court</a>, but this initial decision was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-02-google-safari-privacy-lawsuit-to-continue.html">overturned by the UK’s Court of Appeal</a>, saying that it was quite proper for Google to face a courtroom after the intentional misuse of personal data without consent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>US-style Class Action lawsuits are not common, or even <em>really a thing</em> in UK law, although it is possible for a large group of litigants to bring a joint action. Lloyd and his cohort were trying to establish that Google’s tracking was, in and of itself, harmful, and by extension a standard level of compensation could be calculated. This was the fact that the Supreme Court rejected most clearly — saying that a set figure (reportedly pegged around £750 (around $1,000) per affected user) was not fair redress.</p><p>David Barker of <a href="https://www.pinsentmasons.com/out-law/analysis/lloyd-v-google-supreme-court-representative-action">Pinsent Masons</a> — the firm Google hired to fight this case — wrote that the decision upholds the notion that compensation can only be asked for where real harm has been caused. And that, put simply, Google’s aggregation of personal data was insufficient to cause any real-world harm or mental distress. Richard Lloyd, who brought the action, told <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/mass-legal-action-against-google-blocked-by-supreme-court-12465082"><em>Sky News</em></a> that he was “bitterly disappointed” that the court had “failed to do enough to protect the public from Google and other Big Tech firms who break the law.” And that this ruling, in effect, is the writing of a blank check for large technology companies to keep misusing user data without fear of censure. He added that it is time for government leaders to step in and craft laws to better clamp down on the misuse of personal data.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-supreme-court-blocks-google-safari-privacy-lawsuit-104432598.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">76c693ae-0b96-4ba5-9d1c-083eb1d45d8d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 10:44:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636541075</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T10:44:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80ca2a20-4212-11ec-bdfe-7ed9bb8171fc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/80ca2a20-4212-11ec-bdfe-7ed9bb8171fc" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - 2019/08/23: The exterior view of the entrance to the global internet search company Google office in London.

The agency is now aiming to land the first woman and next American man on the lunar surface in 2025 at the earliest, NASA administrator Bill Nelson has announced. NASA was originally targeting a 2028 launch date for its return to the Moon, but the Trump administration moved that date up by four years back in 2017. In a conference call with reporters, Nelson said &quot;the Trump administration&#39;s target of 2024 human landing was not grounded in technical feasibility.&quot;</p><p>In addition to the unrealistic deadline, Nelson blamed Blue Origin&#39;s lawsuit against the agency for the delay.  It had to put its contract with SpaceX <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-spacex-lunar-lander-on-hold-blue-origin-lawsuit-120527376.html">on hold</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lunar-lander-gao-223702744.html">pause work</a> on the lunar lander that&#39;s meant to take astronauts to the surface of the Moon for a couple of times. NASA lost almost seven months of work on the lander as a result, which had cast doubts on the 2024 landing even before Nelson made his announcement.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you&#39;ll recall, NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">awarded</a> SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract to develop a Starship-based lunar landing system back in April. The agency historically works with more than one contractor for each mission, but in this instance, it inked a deal with Elon Musk&#39;s company alone. Jeff Bezos&#39;s Blue Origin sued NASA over that decision, arguing that it wasn&#39;t given the chance to revise its bid for the project.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on legal documents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22689729/blue-origin-moon-lunar-lander-price-nasa-hls-foia"><em>The Verge</em></a> obtained in September, however, NASA felt that Blue Origin &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-on-blue-origin-lawsuit-151130133.html">gambled</a>&quot; with its proposed $5.9 billion lunar lander bid. The company allegedly set the price higher than necessary, because it assumed that NASA would award it a contract but negotiate for a lower price. The Federal Court of Claims ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-loses-nasa-lawsuit-over-spacex-151101253.html">ruled against Blue Origin</a> a few days ago, dismissing its claims that NASA ignored &quot;key flight safety requirements&quot; when it awarded SpaceX the lunar lander contract.</p><p>Nelson&#39;s announcement comes shortly after NASA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-artemis-i-sls-launch-date-163749274.html">moved</a> the uncrewed Artemis I flight test launch from this year to February 2022. That&#39;s assuming everything will go as planned — the Orion capsule and Space Launch System that will be used for the mission will still have to go through a battery of tests before NASA can schedule it for blastoff.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-pushes-back-crewed-moon-landing-to-2025-083617472.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b292e4bc-2717-4aa6-866c-dd77bd1a01bf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 08:36:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636533405</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T08:36:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1656d640-41f7-11ec-bedf-282cf1a3e77c" width="1600" height="1004" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1656d640-41f7-11ec-bedf-282cf1a3e77c" width="1600" height="1004" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SpaceX]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA moon landing]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA moon landing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Court rules that Apple can't push back ordered App Store payment changes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-10/apple-can-t-delay-costly-court-ordered-app-store-change?sref=10lNAhZ9">failed</a> to convince US District c to delay the App Store change she ordered back in September.

Now, Rogers has rejected the company&#39;s appeal for a stay and called the motion &quot;fundamentally flawed.&quot;</p><p>She wrote in the <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cand.364265/gov.uscourts.cand.364265.830.0_8.pdf">order</a> (PDF, via <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/apple-cant-delay-app-store-payment-changes-judge-says-in-epic-case.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>):</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;...Apple&#39;s motion is based on a selective reading of this Court&#39;s findings and ignores all of the findings which supported the injunction, namely incipient antitrust conduct including supercompetitive commission rates resulting in extraordinarily high operating margins and which have not been correlated to the value of its intellectual property.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Apple argued that it needed more time to establish new guidelines to protect users, developers and itself if it allows alternative payment methods. It also previously said that following the court order and allowing developers to link out to other payment methods by December 9th &quot;would be a poor use of resources&quot; due to the &quot;near-inevitable litigation&quot; from Epic regarding the scope of its compliance. In addition, it&#39;s still appealing this aspect of the case, and the Court of Appeals could take more than a year to come to a decision.</p><p>In her ruling, Rogers said that the party that would benefit most from a stay would be Apple, and that the court can &quot;envision numerous avenues&quot; for the tech giant to comply while still protecting its users. &quot;Other than, perhaps, needing time to establish Guidelines, Apple has provided no credible reason for the Court to believe that the injunction would cause the professed devastation,&quot; she added. Despite the court&#39;s decision, Apple hasn&#39;t given up: It will ask San Francisco&#39;s federal appeals court to put Rogers&#39;s order on hold.</p><p>As <em>CNBC</em> has noted, allowing developers to link out to external payment methods doesn&#39;t mean Apple won&#39;t be taking a percentage of their earnings. Google, for instance, recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-alternate-payment-south-korea-134255092.html">announced</a> that it will now allow the use of alternative payment systems for Play Store apps in South Korea to comply with local laws. While it lowered its commission by four percent for developers using their own payment processors, they will still have to pay the company a cut nonetheless.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-alternative-payment-stay-injunction-062133997.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2fc428fb-a9ad-445b-84be-87d330792c15</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 06:21:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636543869</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T11:31:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/65e95190-e9db-11e9-a7fb-fd7ac0382413" width="4952" height="3185" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/65e95190-e9db-11e9-a7fb-fd7ac0382413" width="4952" height="3185" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nikada via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Hong Kong, China - October 20, 2011: People in the Apple Store at International Finance Center, Central Hong Kong, opened on the September 24, 2011.

If you’re a film buff, you need no introduction to Weta. It’s the VFX house Peter Jackson co-founded in 1993. It has worked on movies like the <em>Fellowship of the Ring</em>, <em>Avatar </em>and <em>Black Widow</em>. Under the $1.625 billion deal, Unity is obtaining the company’s technology division, including its artist tools and engineering talent. Weta’s VFX and animation teams will form a separate entity known as WetaFX, which Peter Jackson will continue to hold a majority stake in. The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, pending regulatory approval.</p><p>Weta’s technology suite includes tools for facial animation, creating virtual cityscapes and modeling the deformation of objects, among many other applications. Unity’s plan is to not only integrate those programs into the Unity Engine but to also eventually offer them as part of cloud-based subscription offering. At some point, many of the assets Weta Digital has created over the years will make their way to the engine as well, allowing anyone with access to Unity to use them.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company didn’t say exactly when those things will happen, but the vision here is to put Unity at the forefront of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a> since whatever it entails will likely need a lot of 3D models. “The unified tools and the incredible scientists and technologists of Weta Digital will accelerate our mission to give content creators easy to use and high performance tools to bring their visions to life,” Unity said in a <a href="https://blog.unity.com/news/welcome-weta-digital">blog post</a>. “Whatever the metaverse is or will be, we believe it will be built by content creators, just like you.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/unity-weta-digital-acquisition-231256259.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9e149f9a-55cc-41c3-b98f-6854e77b35cb</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 23:12:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636550238</ingested><modified>2021-11-10T13:17:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b6eeec0-4228-11ec-bfbf-3fac3ea8d7b1" width="990" height="519" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b6eeec0-4228-11ec-bfbf-3fac3ea8d7b1" width="990" height="519" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Unity Technologies]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A CGI ape overlaid with the Unity and Weta Digital logos.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Unity Technologies / Weta Digital ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta will restrict ad targeting based on thousands of sensitive topics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta will crack down further on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-limit-targeted-ads-teens-130055774.html">potentially harmful ads</a>. <em>The New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/09/technology/meta-facebook-ad-targeting.html">reports</a> Meta is <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/removing-certain-ad-targeting-options-and-expanding-our-ad-controls">removing</a> detailed ad targeting options for &quot;thousands&quot; of sensitive topics on Facebook, Instagram and other services starting January 19th, 2022. The move will bar ads based on interactions with content related to ethnicity, health, political beliefs, religion and sexual orientation, among other hot-button issues.</p><p>It&#39;s a drastic move, and Meta was aware this could hurt some businesses and positive ad uses. However, VP Graham Mudd said the outgoing options could lead to &quot;negative experiences for people in underrepresented groups.&quot; The internet giant believed it could refine its ad platform to serve everyone without hurting business connections.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is also giving you more control over the ads you see.

The company says it wants to work with the Oversight Board to “improve the recommendation process,” though it’s not yet clear what those changes might entail. But it suggests Facebook is looking to shake up the way it deals with the independent body it created to oversee its content policies.</p><p>In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Meta-Q2-and-Q3-2021-Quarterly-Update-on-the-Oversight-Board.pdf"><ins>new report </ins></a>detailing Facebook’s dealings with the Oversight Board, the company notes that it’s made significant changes as the result of the Oversight Board’s recommendations. These changes include updates to how it handles <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-hate-speech-194501894.html"><ins>hate speech</ins></a> and nudity, as well as how it determines “newsworthy” content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But Facebook is now suggesting it wants to change up the recommendation process. “While we have made these important changes as a result of the board’s recommendations, we believe the current design of the recommendation process may not be the best way to bring about the long-term, structural changes the board is pushing us to undertake,” the company writes in its report. “We are working with the board and our internal teams to explore other ways to potentially improve the recommendation process.”</p><p>Again, it’s not clear exactly what this means for the Oversight Board or Facebook’s relationship with the group. The Oversight Board didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and during a call with reporters on Tuesday, Facebook’s Monika Bickert declined to elaborate on specific changes the company was hoping to make.</p><p>In its report, Facebook writes that “the pace and volume of the recommendations do not allow us adequate time to initially assess and implement the recommendations.” According to Facebook, most of the board’s recommendations “require over a dozen people to assess feasibility, which we cannot easily complete in 30 days.” the company added that it can take considerable time to determine how to integrate the policy suggestions into its existing product development.</p><p>But while it’s not yet clear what will change as a result of Facebook’s proposed “potential changes,” the fact that the company is already trying to make major changes to how it deals with the board is significant. Since its inception, Facebook critics have blasted the Oversight Board as little more than a PR stunt. And while the company has said it will abide by individual content decisions made by the board, its broader policy recommendations are where it could have the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-responds-oversight-board-recommendations-210841361.html"><ins>greatest influence</ins></a> over the company. For example, the board criticized Facebook’s decision to impose an “indefinite suspension” on former President Donald Trump, and told the company it needed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-trump-influence-203741183.html"><ins>better define</ins></a> its rules for politicians.</p><p>Facebook has even suggested that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-other-companies-202448589.html"><ins>other platforms</ins></a> should use the Oversight Board to monitor their content policies as well. That the company is now claiming it’s too difficult to keep up with the process its executives and policy officials designed could potentially undermine the influence the board is able to wield.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-wants-to-change-the-oversight-boards-recommendation-process-212528909.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f5c3ab0-9ea9-4d65-bcf8-6ddadb7e451f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 21:25:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636493129</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T21:25:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff04e120-41a2-11ec-8ed1-4b04c9c94203" width="6074" height="4216" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ff04e120-41a2-11ec-8ed1-4b04c9c94203" width="6074" height="4216" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 07: Oversight Board logo is seen on a smart phone in Ankara, Turkey on May 07, 2020.

Additionally, platforms that continue to use recommendation algorithms need to have a notification that informs people those recommendations are based on inferences generated by their personal data.

The new numbers, released with the company’s latest quarterly transparency reports, come as Meta faces increasing scrutiny over its ability to protect users and enforce its policies adequately around the world.</p><p>Its latest report marks the first time the company has shared &quot;prevalence&quot; metrics around <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/how-meta-addresses-bullying-harassment/">bullying and harassment</a> on its platform. &quot;Prevalence&quot; is a statistic Facebook uses to track violating content that slips through its detection systems. &quot;It represents the amount of violating content that people actually view that actually shows up on someone&#39;s screen,&quot; the company&#39;s VP of Integrity Guy Rosen told reporters during a briefing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the company, the prevalence of bullying content was between 0.14% -0.15% on Facebook and between 0.05%-0.06% on Instagram. “This means bullying and harassment content was seen between 14 and 15 times per every 10,000 views of content on Facebook and between 5 and 6 times per 10,000 views of content on Instagram,” the company explains in a statement. Instagram in particular has faced questions about its ability to deal with bullying and harassment. The company introduced several new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-new-antibullying-features-and-photo-map-040107581.html">anti-bullying</a> measures earlier this year after several UK football players detailed their experience with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-cracks-down-harassment-direct-messages-185441529.html">racist abuse</a> on the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Importantly, the company notes that this “prevalence” metric only accounts for content Facebook and Instagram removes without a user report. That means the statistic is only capturing a subset of all bullying content, since bullying and harassment is not always easy for an automated system to identify.</p><p>That distinction has been underscored by revelations in the Facebook Papers, a trove of documents made public by former employee turned whistleblower Frances Haugen. According to documents she shared, Facebook’s own researchers <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/10/25/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-whistleblower/">estimate</a> that the company is only able to address around three to five percent of hate speech on its platform, meaning the vast majority goes undetected and is allowed to pollute users’ News Feeds.</p><p>Facebook has repeatedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-hate-speech-prevalence-170144850.html">pushed back</a> on these claims, and has pointed to the “prevalence” stats it shares in its transparency reports. But as researchers have <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/facebooks-deceptive-math-when-it-comes-to-hate-speech/">pointed out</a>, the company’s own accounting of “prevalence” can mask the true amount of violating content on the platform. That’s because Facebook’s automated systems are not always reliable, especially at detecting content in languages <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ai-enforce-rules-engineers-doubtful-artificial-intelligence-11634338184">other than English</a>. The revelations have fueled allegations that Facebook puts profits ahead of user safety.</p><p>“We have absolutely no incentive, whether it&#39;s commercial or otherwise, to do anything other than make sure people have a positive experience,” Rosen said Tuesday. “I think it&#39;s also just not true that our algorithms are just optimized to squeeze out engagement. We&#39;re constantly refining how we do ranking in order to tackle these problems.”</p><p>In its latest report, Facebook reported that hate speech had declined for the fourth straight quarter, with prevalence declining from 0.05% last quarter to 0.03% this quarter. The company also reported prevalence of hate speech on Instagram for the first time, saying hate speech was at 0.02% or around 2 out of every 10,000 pieces of content viewed on its platform.</p><p>However, it’s worth noting that even the most optimistic take on these numbers — 0.03% and 0.02% for Facebook and Instagram, respectively — can still mean millions of people are encountering hate speech every day, given the vast number of users and pieces of content posted to the platforms each day.&nbsp;</p><p>Separately, Facebook also said<a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/the-shift-to-generalized-ai-to-better-identify-violating-content"> its researchers</a> are working on &quot;a relatively new area of AI research called &#39;few-shot&#39; or &#39;zero-shot&#39; learning,&quot; which would enable them to train AI models much more rapidly. Instead of relying on massive datasets to manually train models for, say identifying hate speech, it would enable models that can &quot;learn to recognize something from just a small number of training examples, or even just a single example,&quot; the company wrote. Facebook didn&#39;t say how long it might take to put this research into action, but it suggests the company is still pursuing AI advancements to address major content issues.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metas-latest-transparency-report-details-bullying-and-harassment-on-facebook-and-instagram-182854231.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2cc2ce7d-f079-4133-b8a4-b711a52cc572</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 18:28:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636486339</ingested><modified>2021-11-09T19:32:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/031e5fd0-4189-11ec-bbbd-6725d3f4bdef" width="5900" height="3758" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/031e5fd0-4189-11ec-bbbd-6725d3f4bdef" width="5900" height="3758" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - OCTOBER 29: In this photo illustration logo of Meta is displayed on a mobile phone screen and apps icons on a computer screen in Ankara, Turkey on October 29, 2021.

The company is rolling out a string of sleep-related improvements to Nest screens that include a catalog of Calm &quot;Sleep Stories.&quot; As of December, you can ask Google to &quot;start a meditation&quot; and your smart display will play audio to wind you down. You&#39;ll only have access to several tracks for free, but you can unlock the full library if you have a Calm Premium membership.</p><p>Other upgrades provide more detail for the tracking itself.

You&#39;ll know how long any interruptions might have lasted, too. The Hub&#39;s sound detection also now focuses only on coughs and snores inside your designated sleeping area, so you&#39;ll know how much a partner (or noisy pet) is affecting your rest. All sounds beyond that area are lumped into an &quot;other sounds&quot; section.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The tracking features start reaching users today.
