Hulu has become the exclusive streaming partner for Lollapalooza 2021, and <a href="https://www.hulu.com/lollapalooza">will stream</a> the Chicago event to on-demand subscribers between July 29th and August 1st starting at 2PM Eastern (1PM Central). Yes, that means what you think it does — Lollapalooza won&#39;t be streaming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-31-youtube-lollapalooza-2019-live-stream.html">on YouTube</a> like it has in recent years.</p><p>There&#39;s no extra charge, and you can watch if you sign up for a free trial. The Lollapalooza 2021 lineup includes plenty of big names, including Illenium (July 29th), Tyler, the Creator (July 30th), Post Malone (July 31st) and Foo Fighters (August 1st).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Hulu has streamed concerts before, including a Black History Month show in February and a <em>Summer of Soul</em> tribute on Juneteenth. However, this is the service&#39;s first exclusive live event. It&#39;s a big bet that livestreams like this can translate to more customers, not to mention draw attention away from free services like YouTube.</p><p>Whether or not music fans follow is another matter. YouTube is still a go-to destination for live festivals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-livestream-coachella-2022-063025456.html">like Coachella</a>, and that may be what virtual concertgoers are expecting. There&#39;s a real possibility that many would-be viewers will just skip Lollapalooza altogether rather than sign up for Hulu, no matter how easily they can cancel service afterward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lollapalooza-2021-live-stream-hulu-140043962.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dd38225c-7c6b-4ef0-ad5e-ae8e4e23e15e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627480847</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T14:00:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2002ca10-efa8-11eb-9d43-e80c882c0e9b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2002ca10-efa8-11eb-9d43-e80c882c0e9b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gabriella Angotti-Jones / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tyler, the Creator performs during Governors Ball Music Festival at Randall's Island Park in New York, U.S. May 31, 2019.

As the name suggests, the latest member of the family is a true wireless set (and the company’s first model without a wired option). As you might expect, Nura’s flagship automatic hearing test (for sound tailored to your hearing) is here, along with many other features the company has already made synonymous with its brand. But with a smaller form factor, are compromises inevitable?</p><p>The Nuratrue ($199/£199) is a simplified version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-03-nura-nuraphones-review.html"><ins>Nuraphone </ins></a>over-ears and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nuraloop-wireless-headphones-review-120007318.html"><ins>Nuraloop </ins></a>wireless (but tethered) sports buds. As mentioned, the audio customization feature is present, as is the “ambient” mode — which Nura calls “social mode.” There’s even Active Noise Cancelling and “immersion” mode, which simulates the feeling of being at a live event. The last two are a little simplified compared to their bigger siblings, though.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The original Nuraphone’s immersion mode delivers tactile bass with transducers creating a sensation of volume and presence similar to being in front of a large speaker. On the Nuratrue, it feels more like a bass “boost” feature you might find on an equalizer. Active Noise Cancellation on the Nuratrue works pretty well, but is tied to the social mode feature which means they are activated as a pair. This makes no real functional difference, but something to bear in mind. Battery life is estimated at six hours here and seems accurate, which can be extended to around 24 hours via the charging case.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eef58e40-ef7e-11eb-b5bd-586bc02fc4c2" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Nuratrue hands-on." data-uuid="d4f3ebed-4ee4-3437-b2f0-8057b61ab44e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>If you were a fan of the Nuraloop, you might have expected the Nuratrue to be broadly the same, minus the connecting cable. But you’d be wrong. The new buds barely share any visual or physical DNA with their cabled sibling. Instead the Nuratrue has a much larger, circular body which sorta looks like you’re wearing “plugs,” but in the middle of your ear. This extra size might sound like a negative, but it makes them easier to touch (for controls) and likely helps keep them wirelessly connected to each other.</p><p>That “touchability” is important, as, like most TWS earphones, it’s how you’ll interact with them — in particular, for activating things like immersion or social mode. (ANC can only be toggled via the app it seems, and as mentioned disables social mode with it). In my testing with them the touch was more responsive than most other TWS headphones I’ve tried, especially the tricky double-tap which I find often requires a few attempts to register correctly. As with all Nura headphones you can easily assign different tasks to either side for both single and double taps, making it easy to have the controls you use the most at hand (or finger, technically).</p><p>Obviously, the main selling point here is Nura’s proprietary audio personalization. The ability to create personal hearing profiles is kinda Nura’s whole <em>thing</em>. It’s a feature you see on other brands, too, but Nura’s is the simplest and, in my experience, the most reliable. Mostly, because it doesn’t involve any subjectivity. Just pop the buds in your ears, walk through the profile creation process in the app and the headphones do everything else. Most other similar “tests” require you to tell the app how well/if you heard something. As someone who’s done more than their fair share of hearing tests, I always start imagining phantom sounds and worry that affects my results.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2be14240-ef7f-11eb-95ef-2ac45793c076" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Nuratrue hands-on." data-uuid="9c5efb9d-4837-31e9-bbbb-00680b14a3fc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Cool features are… cool and all, but you probably just want to know how they sound? I guess the smart answer is, that will depend on your ears. The slightly more helpful answer is that, for me, the personalized audio definitely puts the Nuratrue above most of the TWS headphones I have tried. It’s not that they have better bass or polished treble, although those would be fair statements, it’s more that they feel neutral and balanced.</p><p>Whereas “unpersonalized” buds may be technically balanced on a graph, I know that my hearing isn’t perfect and thus might be slightly worse at certain frequencies. With Nura’s personalized tuning, it’s hard to know what frequency curve I am getting, or even if that’s what my hearing really “needs” but what I do know is that I like it!</p><p>Now, I guess I should also say that I am never sure just how effective Nura’s hearing test really is. The company claims that it uses <a href="https://www.asha.org/public/hearing/otoacoustic-emissions/">otoacoustic emissions</a> to determine the characteristics of your hearing. The same test is sometimes used to determine cochlear hearing loss in newborns. That said, every time I’ve been to an audiologist (which is more times than I would like) I have asked them about using OAE tests for headphones, and all of them have been skeptical it can be done on hardware at this price. When I asked Nura about this, they gave the following reply:</p><p>“The OAE signal produced by a person&#39;s ears is indeed faint - much like the signals of GPS satellites are faint by the time they reach the Earth&#39;s surface. That&#39;s why GPS-enabled devices of 20-15 years ago were much larger, less accurate, and took longer to acquire a signal than today&#39;s smartphones or even smartwatches. Similar advances in signal processing have enabled the huge improvement in GPS device performance and the quick &amp; reliable measurements of OAEs in devices as small as Nuratrue.”</p><p>In short, the company claims that advances in technology have allowed for the test to be practical in small, consumer devices.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/50366800-ef7f-11eb-8cff-18d24091138f" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Nuratrue hands-on." data-uuid="eeccb67b-bcbe-36cc-ab90-d6e5bd5ecdb4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Back to the physical design briefly. It might not be for everyone, but it feels very much in keeping with Nura’s apparent mission to do things a little bit differently. I’ve never really found a TWS design that I think has fully cracked it (although <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html"><ins>Jabra’s Elite 75t</ins></a> comes close?), and that’s true here. But, as mentioned earlier, I do appreciate the large surface area for controlling playback or activating/deactivating the extra features. Extended wear remains comfortable, and the fit works well for my ears.</p><p>If I had one minor gripe, it’d be the maximum volume. It’s not low. In fact, for me, it’s more or less ideal for comfortable, extended use. It’s just that, “comfortable” is the maximum, so when a song comes on that I really love and I decide that, heck, I can crank this one up a bit before going back to normal levels… there’s nowhere to go. Again, this might not be an issue for you. I’ll be the first to admit I probably haven’t done my ears any favors over the years, but it was something I noticed fairly quickly in my time with the Nuratrue.</p><p>In an ocean of true wireless headphones, it’s hard to stand out. But Nura’s personalized audio is certainly enough to do just that. Of all the “customizable” headphones I’ve tried, Nura’s are still the ones to beat. And with the Nuratrue priced at least $80 cheaper than the flagship models from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html"><ins>Sony</ins></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-19-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review.html"><ins>Sennheiser </ins></a>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-quietcomfort-earbuds-review-144502194.html"><ins>Bose</ins></a>, that’s just another easy way for the company to garner attention.</p><p>The Nuratrue is available starting today.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nuratrue-true-wireless-headphones-140003973.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">296e041f-cc23-40c6-a533-1b50a3a95285</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 14:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627465321</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T09:42:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8a0e8490-eee9-11eb-bbff-5bcf24e5afe0" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8a0e8490-eee9-11eb-bbff-5bcf24e5afe0" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nuratrue review.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nuratrue review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Archived WhatsApp chats will no longer come back to haunt you]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Your archived <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whats-app-lets-you-use-different-wallpapers-for-individual-chats-080121431.html">WhatsApp chats</a> will no longer resurrect themselves — unless you let them.

In the last year, I’ve seen fellow Engadget employees buy a Nintendo Switch just before the OLED model broke cover, take the plunge with the iPhone SE just before the iPhone 12 mini was unveiled and make several more shopping missteps. Now, I might have done the same.</p><p>I picked up Sony’s vlogging camera, the ZV-1, earlier this month. I was looking for an agile video setup for the occasional time I have to record footage at Engadget without a skilled member of our video team. It’s very easy to make it work, with great face tracking capabilities and even a product showcase mode that helps me really show off whatever gadget I’m handling and I was happy with it.&nbsp;</p><p>For a couple of weeks.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a768330-eeec-11eb-9fbf-1ce709229319" alt="Sony mirrorless ZV-E10" data-uuid="d59cdf73-35f2-3b40-b640-c90d4d3fd498"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure><p>Then I heard the rumors that Sony was about to expand its vlogging camera family, and my heart sank. Here it is, then. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-expands-its-vlogging-lineup-with-the-zv-e-10-mirrorless-camera-142731045.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">ZV E-10</a>, a new vlogging camera that fuses the tiny frame of the ZV-1 with interchangeable lenses.&nbsp;</p><p>The two major improvements seem to be a larger 24-megapixel sensor and an interchangeable mirrorless mount. The latter means you can use one of the 60-plus E-mount lenses, while that larger sensor should offer improved light sensitivity and a shallower depth of field. The ZV-E10 will launch by the end of August and will cost $700 for the body or $800 in a bundle with one of Sony&#39;s power zoom lens. The price is roughly level with how much I paid for the ZV-1 earlier this month. It’s probably too late to ask for a refund, right?&nbsp;</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-q2-2021-earnings-210238898.html%20https://www.engadget.com/..."><br>iPhone sales were up 50 percent year over year</a></h2><h3>Another record-breaking quarter for Apple.</h3><h3></h3><p>Despite the pandemic, Apple has spent most of the last two years relentlessly upgrading its product lineup, and its moves are definitely paying off.

Today, the audio giant was proved right, as new signups fell to nine million new users in the <a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-2021/default.aspx">most recent quarter</a>. That said, slower growth isn’t always a bad thing. Of that nine million figure, seven million users signed up for Premium, versus just two million who went ad-supported. It means that Spotify was also able to announce a second successive quarter of profitability after a long period of losses.</p><p>The total number of Spotify users now stands at 365 million, of which 165 million are paying for Premium, while the remaining 210 are ad-supported. Converting more of Spotify’s vast ad-supported user base into Premium users is one way to ensure the company remains profitable. Another, of course, is to boost its growing advertising business, which has been bolstered by Spotify’s numerous podcast offerings. The company said that it saw “triple digit” year-on-year gain in ad-sales for the company’s owned podcast outlets, including The Ringer, Parcast and Gimlet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The last three months has seen Spotify intensify work to push users toward cheaper forms of audio content than music.

No mention this month of how many people are tuning in to listen to former President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen hang out, which was the second biggest podcast on the platform from the start of the year.</p><p>As for the future, Spotify says that it’s hoping to add at least 12 million more users in total, and at least another five million more paying customers. It is still expecting to reach the coveted 400 million user figure by the end of the year, although given the uncertainties still present with COVID-19, you never can be sure.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-q2-2021-premium-users-103530500.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94d0ec5d-6309-4645-801b-9126cab3b915</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 10:35:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627478287</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T13:18:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-02/f937c040-2a0e-11e9-b2b8-b86eee421003" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-02/f937c040-2a0e-11e9-b2b8-b86eee421003" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Coppola via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BROOKLYN, NY - AUGUST 09:  Spotify CEO Daniel Ek speaks onstage during Samsung Unpacked New York City at Barclays Center on August 9, 2018 in Brooklyn City.

But Jeremy Dao, another team member from the lab, said they were able to &quot;reach the limits of the hardware and show what it can do.&quot; The work the team does will help expand the understanding of legged locomotion and could help make bipedal robots become more common in the future.</p><div id="1f74672132fe4a1081acd7d08dcbff43"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FSaSjd_HOaI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/watch-cassie-bipedal-robot-run-5k-093045955.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7482a1ed-7ef7-40b5-ad78-ed266c1be7a9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 09:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627475790</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T12:36:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/62827220-ef6a-11eb-bd36-1a42b00c4d07" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/62827220-ef6a-11eb-bd36-1a42b00c4d07" width="1600" height="1032" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Agility Robotics]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cassie]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cassie]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG will reportedly sell iPhones in its South Korean stores]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rumors swirled <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/07/20/apple-iphones-to-be-sold-lg-stores-korea/">last week</a> that LG would start selling iPhones in some of its South Korean stores, since it has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-mobile-worldwide-shutdown-020959355.html">stopped producing</a> its own smartphones,. Now, LG has confirmed that it will start selling iPhones and other Apple products next month, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/amd-q2-strong-amid-epyc-ryzen-demand"><em>ZDNet</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>LG and Samsung agreed in 2018 to only sell their own smartphones at their respective stores so they wouldn&#39;t compete with smaller phone distributors. As such, when LG started to consider selling iPhones, it reportedly faced resistance from a smartphone reseller trade organization. Now that it has stopped making its own phones, however, that group has reportedly signed a new contract that allows LG to sell phones from other manufacturers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of selling iPhones starting next month, LG will reportedly sell the Watch and other Apple products. The company has 400 stores in South Korea, so the move could provide a significant boost to Apple. It could be to the detriment of Apple&#39;s arch-rival Samsung, though, which has essentially had the local smartphone market to itself since LG dropped out.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple supposedly started negotiating with LG to sell phones in its retail spaces after the Korean company announced it would end production of its own devices. Both Samsung and Apple have been offering to pay LG smartphone owners up to 150,000 won ($135) to trade in their phones.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-will-reportedly-sell-i-phones-in-its-south-korean-stores-081516817.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4133a30-7315-4c75-a05f-66839500264e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 08:15:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627455400</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T06:56:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44e4da40-ef6b-11eb-bdcd-e81c487eef97" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44e4da40-ef6b-11eb-bdcd-e81c487eef97" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG will reportedly sell iPhones in its South Korean stores]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG will reportedly sell iPhones in its South Korean stores]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vivaldi's Accordion tab stacks expand when you need them and hide when you don't]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the start of June, Vivaldi released its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivaldi-browser-update-mail-translation-110321734.html">4.0 update</a>, which added features like a translation tool to the privacy-focused browser. Its new 4.1 update is a smaller release but still adds a handful of handy features, including a new way to organize tabs.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-chrome-tab-groups-feature-164057759.html">Like Chrome</a>, Vivaldi allows you to group multiple tabs to restore some semblance of order to your tab bar. In Vivaldi, those groups are called stacks. Before 4.1, you had two ways of using them. You could opt for either the compact view or the two-level one. In the latter case, the browser adds a bar that displays the tabs you have in that stack. The compact view, by contrast, only hints at the number of websites you have pinned to the same group.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f88249b0-ef12-11eb-8f54-fec49ac3fa84" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="Accordion tab stack setting" data-uuid="467ada23-04d3-3675-bf99-b186637f5922"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivaldi</div></figure><p>The new &quot;Accordion&quot; stacks Vivaldi is introducing today give you a third option that is something of a compromise between its two siblings. The icon that represents the group will automatically expand when you click on it. Instead of on a second bar, you’ll see all the included tabs to the right of that icon. In that way, you can get context about your tabs without them taking up an entire extra element of the interface.</p><p>The other major feature the company is adding with 4.1 is called command chains. In Vivaldi, you can press “F2” (or “Command E” on Mac) to bring up a command-line interface, allowing you to quickly access most features without digging through the menu for the relevant option. Command chains allow you to group multiple actions and assign a name to them. Typing the name of the chain in the command interface will execute the included actions in a sequence. With more than 200 actions available, you have a lot of flexibility. For instance, you can create one that enables both fullscreen and reading modes at the same time. You can also assign the sequences you make to a custom keyboard shortcut or mouse gesture.</p><p>Outside of those features, 4.1 adds a timer in <a href="https://help.vivaldi.com/tutorials/reader-view-in-vivaldi/">reader view</a> that estimates how long it should take you to work your way through an article. Lastly, the browser’s Windows client will now install new features in the background automatically. There’s an option to turn off “silent updates” in the settings menu. You can try Vivaldi 4.1 today.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/vivaldi-accordion-tab-stacks-070000491.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">526f1b02-11ab-4b42-bf17-00c59f397f50</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 07:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627415708</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T19:55:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/83f4c0b0-ef11-11eb-a9ff-cc67090b4e07" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/83f4c0b0-ef11-11eb-a9ff-cc67090b4e07" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vivaldi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Vivaldi Accordion tab stacks]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Vivaldi Accordion tab stacks]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rivian reportedly plans to invest $5 billion in its second US assembly plant]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week, news <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-second-factory-capacity-battery-cells-193825530.html">leaked out</a> that Rivian was planning to build a second US manufacturing plant for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-r1s-suv-delivery-dates-151911858.html">electric vehicles</a> and batteries, and now more details have leaked out. The company plans to invest $5 billion initially in the second plant, dubbed Project Tera, with construction slated to start in the fall of 2021, according to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/exclusive-rivian-ready-invest-5-billion-second-us-assembly-plant-document-2021-07-27/"><em>Reuters</em></a>. The aim is to begin production by the second quarter of 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>The second plant will reportedly include a 50 gigawatt-hour (GWh) battery cell production operation and a product and technology center. There&#39;s no word on where it&#39;ll be built, but the company is reportedly looking at land east of Mesa, Arizona, near Gold Canyon, according to <em>Reuters</em>&#39; sources. Rivian Chief Executive R.J. Scaringe has reportedly spoken with Arizona Governor Doug Ducey about the project.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rivian previously acknowledged that it&#39;s looking to expand. “The company has recognized that future production and product plans will not be fully met by the current capacity at Rivian’s Normal, Illinois facility,” it said in the document seen by <em>Reuters</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>The plant would supposedly support around 10,000 jobs, though many of those could come indirectly. For a startup that has so far not produced a single vehicle, however, the investment and job figures would be impressive. Rivian is backed by Ford, Amazon and other companies and could reportedly soar to a $50 billion value in a possible public listing later this year, according to Reuters&#39; previous story.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rivian-reportedly-plans-to-invest-5-billion-in-a-second-us-assembly-plant-052245738.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">313070a3-2a0e-4482-865e-ad259130fe7e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jul 2021 05:22:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627449822</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T05:23:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/7ee95050-93b7-11eb-9e7f-a226a0880ebc" width="6415" height="4277" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/7ee95050-93b7-11eb-9e7f-a226a0880ebc" width="6415" height="4277" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rivian introduces R1T all-electric pickup truck at Los Angeles Auto Show in Los Angeles, California, U.S. November 27, 2018.

The company just announced financial results for its fiscal year third quarter (for normal humans, the months of April through June), and the company made a shocking amount of money. All of its product segments (the iPhone, Mac, iPad, services, and wearables/home/accessories) increased in revenue year-over-year, leading to total revenue of $81.4 billion. As has often been the case, iPhone revenue of $39.6 billion made up almost half of that figure.&nbsp;</p><p>Quarterly revenue was up 36 percent year-over-year, and as such profit grew in a big way, too — in fact, it nearly doubled. Apple reported $21.7 billion in net income, up 93 percent compared to a year ago.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As already mentioned, all of Apple&#39;s product categories grew last quarter, but the biggest winner was the iPhone. Revenue grew 50 percent year-over-year, making it pretty clear the iPhone 12 lineup is a major success for the company. Apple&#39;s services division continues to explode; $17.5 billion in revenue represented 33 percent growth, and the category makes more than double the money of any other division in Apple, with the obvious exception of the iPhone.</p><p>The company&#39;s &quot;wearables, home and accessories&quot; group lumps the Apple Watch in with devices like the HomePod mini and the new AirTags. It grew 36 percent and made $8.8 billion in revenue. The Mac and iPad had more modest gains, with Mac revenue increasing 16 percent year over year to $8.2 billion and iPad revenue climbing 12 percent to $7.4 billion. While the Mac number isn&#39;t an eye-popper like services, it&#39;s worth nothing that just a few years ago, Mac revenue was pretty flat, sitting in the $4 billion range for a while — but it seems like the M1 Mac move has helped spur some big increases.</p><p>As usual, Apple CEO Tim Cook is holding a call with investors — we&#39;ll update this story with anything we learn.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-q2-2021-earnings-210238898.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc8b7e84-d0a3-450e-8dc2-1c99bbb12648</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 21:02:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627420001</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T21:06:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e6b6c310-e417-11eb-bb99-2be7f7ad1e4f" width="5719" height="3805" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e6b6c310-e417-11eb-bb99-2be7f7ad1e4f" width="5719" height="3805" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ANGELA WEISS via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[People walk past an Apple retail store on July 13, 2021 in New York City. - Stock markets were slightly softer on news of the biggest jump in US inflation in more than two decades and disappointment in results from US investment banks.

In its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2021-Q4/press-release-webcast">Q4 earnings report today</a>, the company reported a 21 percent increase in revenues compared to last year, reaching $46.2 billion. But even more impressive, its profits jumped by 47 percent to reach $16.5 billion. Microsoft&#39;s success is practically a broken record by this point — last quarter it saw <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-q3-2021-earnings-report-pandemic-204921611.html">a 44 percent increase in profit</a>, and before that it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-earnings-q2-2021-214039752.html">grew by 33 percent</a> — but it&#39;s still managing to <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-q4-earnings-2021-205140685.html">beat the expectations of Wall Street analysts</a>.</p><p>The key to Microsoft&#39;s growth is the same as it has been for the past several years. Its Intelligent Cloud business is seemingly unstoppable, growing by 30 percent compared to last year. And it&#39;s still seeing plenty of growth with Office, Linkedin and its other business apps, which together have increased revenues by 25 percent. Even its More Personal Computing group, which includes Windows and Xbox, saw its business improve by 9 percent.

The company reported an overall revenue increase of 18 percent for 2021 ($168.1 billion), as well as a 38 percent jump in profit for the year ($61.3 billion).

That&#39;s a jump of 62 percent from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-alphabet-q1-2020-earnings-210401873.html">same period last year</a>, when the organization&#39;s revenue dipped due to the onset of the pandemic. Last quarter, Alphabet posted $55.3 billion in revenue. Clearly, the company has long recovered from the slump it faced from the pandemic last year. Like chief financial officer Ruth Porat said on an earnings call, its results are &quot;lapping the impact of COVID on our business.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Like it did last quarter, Alphabet&#39;s net income rose significantly, from about $7 billion in Q2 2020 to $18.5 billion in the same period this year. Most of its money continues to come from advertising and search, while Google Cloud and its &quot;Other Bets&quot; division saw modest revenue growth as well.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement that &quot;a rising tide of online activity in many parts of the world&quot; and &quot;long-term investments in AI and Google Cloud&quot; drove the results. Pichai also said on the company&#39;s earnings call that it set &quot;a number of records this quarter.&quot; Publisher partners earned more than ever from Google&#39;s network, he said, and Alphabet has paid more to its YouTube creators and partners than any quarter in history.</p><p>Pichai also shouted out recent developments in AI across Google&#39;s portfolio, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-hands-on-181528378.html">upcoming Android 12</a>, updated <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/">conversation technology LaMDA </a>and more. He also emphasized Google Cloud, detailing developments in security solutions and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-workspace-open-everyone-free-spaces-100004157.html">Workspace</a>, including the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-smart-canvas-productivity-app-172323639.html">Smart Canvas that it showed off</a> at Google I/O.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, Pichai said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-available-globally-161554248.html">YouTube Shorts</a> (its TikTok-like feature) broke a new record by surpassing 15 billion daily views. YouTube subscriptions across things like Premium and Music also continue to grow. He also gave an update on self-driving vehicle company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-213249367.html">Waymo</a>, which first launched its services to the public in October 2020. Since then, it&#39;s &quot;served thousands of rides without a human driver,&quot; he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, since the bulk of Alphabet&#39;s money comes from advertising, much of the earnings call dwelled on how retailers used Google&#39;s product to market their services to consumers. Chief business officer Philipp Schindler also spent some time talking about YouTube&#39;s reach, and how it&#39;s able to reach an audience that traditional TV and broadcast networks don&#39;t.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the company&#39;s Other Bets division, which covers its hardware products, cost a lot more money than it made this quarter, it&#39;s possible some of those investments will pay off in the months to come, since Google typically launches new phones in the fall. Porat closed the call with some statements on outlook, saying, &quot;We believe it&#39;s still too early to forecast the longer term trends as markets reopen, especially given the recent increase in COVID cases globally.&quot; While it&#39;s not guaranteed to continue posting super strong results for the quarters to come, we&#39;re sure Alphabet is going to be okay.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-google-earnings-q2-2021-202832294.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aac89cdd-9d8a-4b35-bd2a-a7d786283bee</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 20:28:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627419479</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T20:58:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95d5ff40-eef5-11eb-bfcd-dec53336397b" width="4388" height="2926" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95d5ff40-eef5-11eb-bfcd-dec53336397b" width="4388" height="2926" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shannon Stapleton / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The outside of Google headquarters is seen in New York City, U.S., June 17, 2021.

He was later convicted on securities fraud and securities fraud conspiracy charges and sentenced to seven years in prison. A forfeiture judgment of about $7.4 million was also made against Shkreli, and the government later seized assets to satisfy the judgment — including the album.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All of which brings us to today. <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/united-states-sells-unique-wu-tang-clan-album-forfeited-convicted-hedge-fund-manager"><ins>The government has sold</ins></a><em>Once Upon a Time In Shaolin</em>. Prosecutors didn&#39;t say who bought the album or how much they paid, but the sale covers the outstanding balance Shkreli owed the government.</p><p>So, after three years of being locked in a federal vault, and almost four years of being owned by the weaselly Shkreli (who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-06-martin-shkreli-wu-tang-clan-ebay.html"><ins>tried to sell it on eBay</ins></a> before he was incarcerated), the album is once again in private ownership.

It&#39;s unclear whether that stipulation is still in place, but Shkreli was allowed to play it at listening parties. Maybe the new proprietor of <em>Once Upon a Time In Shaolin </em>will feel generous enough to play it for Wu-Tang fans somewhere.

According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-employees-plan-walkout-wednesday-to-1847362030"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, at least 50 employees will protest the company&#39;s recent actions in person and call on it to improve working conditions for women by at least temporarily leaving their posts on Wednesday, July 28th.

According to a <a href="https://tech.fb.com/community-letter/"><ins>blog post</ins></a> from Andrew Bosworth, head of Facebook’s Reality Labs, “a very small percentage” of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Quest 2</a> owners have experienced some amount of skin irritation after using the removable foam face insert that comes with every Quest 2 headset and Fit Pack.</p><p>Bosworth says Facebook conducted a review of its manufacturing process and found no unexpected or hazardous contaminants in the insert. Still, out of a desire to create  “safe and unbelievable experiences for all,” the company is introducing a new silicone cover that fits over the component. Whether you’ve had issues with the insert or not, you can request that Facebook send you the silicone cover for free. To do so, go to the “My Devices” section of your <a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/removable-facial-interface-alert/"><ins>account page</ins></a> and click the dedicated button that’s there.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook is also halting sales of the Oculus Quest temporarily while it works with distributors to add the silicone cover to every Quest 2 package. The company anticipates the headset will be back on store shelves by August 24th. As part of today’s recall, Facebook is also introducing a new 128GB variant of the Oculus Quest 2. It will replace the existing 64GB model, and feature the same $299 price tag as its predecessor. The 128GB model will go on sale on August 24th, the same day the company plans to restart Quest 2 sales.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/quest-2-foam-facial-interface-recall-163432642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2aac1db1-10fc-40be-8020-69c05893639b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:34:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627403677</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T16:34:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0c308010-eef7-11eb-bf95-d05c8071270a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0c308010-eef7-11eb-bf95-d05c8071270a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2 foam insert]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oculus Quest 2 foam insert]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix turned a Twitter account into an animated show]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yet another <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitter"><ins>Twitter</ins></a> account has been turned into a TV show. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/netflix"><ins>Netflix</ins></a> has adapted Chicago Party Aunt (<a href="https://twitter.com/ChiPartyAunt"><ins>@ChiPartyAunt</ins></a>) into an adult animated series of the same name.</p><p>Actor Chris Witaske, who&#39;s perhaps best known for his role in Netflix series <em>Love</em>, is behind the account.

Last week, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-tv-update-features-from-google-tv-160004195.html">Android TV</a> exported some of Google TV&#39;s best features including a watchlist, recommended tuning and detail pages. Now, it&#39;s the turn of the Google TV app on Android, formerly Play Movies &amp; TV, an all-round entertainment hub for streaming, buying and renting movies and TV shows. Courtesy of a new update, the app is getting a fresh design and a raft of new reality, global and live TV programming.</p><p>As if the branding wasn&#39;t convoluted enough, to make things more complicated the service is only available in the US. For everyone else, there&#39;s the Play Movies &amp; TV app, which is limited to digital downloads.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With that out of the way, let&#39;s take a closer look at the new stuff. In terms of new content, Google is adding programming from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/discovery-plus-now-available-roku-amazon-fire-181032400.html">Discovery+</a> and Rakuten&#39;s Asian drama streamer Viki, along with kids&#39; shows from Cartoon Network, PBS kids, and Boomerang and live TV from YouTube TV, Philo and fuboTV.&nbsp;</p><p>A new design, meanwhile, should make deciding what to watch that tad bit easier. Google is emphasising movie and TV shows with 16:9 widescreen posters, below which you can find Rotten Tomatoes scores. The company has also improved its discovery algorithm that matches movie and shows to your tastes. You can put it to the test by scouring the new rows of personalized recommendations, including new sub-genres like sci-fi thrillers and summer blockbusters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-tv-update-android-160044153.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6d9c9772-7944-4476-bd5d-4b91c46200ab</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 16:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627382415</ingested><modified>2021-07-27T10:40:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/672bbde0-eec5-11eb-98fe-2fbf74880168" width="2880" height="1800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/672bbde0-eec5-11eb-98fe-2fbf74880168" width="2880" height="1800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pinterest is giving creators ways to make money on the platform]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Pinterest influencers might soon be able to make a living directly from the platform.

Influencers who create content on behalf of a company can tag the brand in Idea Pins. Once the brand gives the tag the green light, the label will appear. The aim is to improve transparency and make it easier for creators to disclose paid partnerships.</p><p>“Pinterest is the place where creators with inspiring and actionable ideas get discovered,&quot; Aya Kanai, Pinterest head of content and creator partnerships, said in a statement. &quot;With this latest update, we’re empowering Creators to reach millions of shoppers on the platform and monetize their work. Creators deserve to be rewarded for the inspiration they deliver to their followers, and the sales they drive for brands.&quot;</p><p>Product tagging on Idea Pins will initially be available on business accounts in the US and UK. The feature will hit other markets in the coming months. As for paid partnerships, select Pinterest users in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Sweden, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Peru now have access.</p><p>Other visually focused platforms are focusing on ways to help influencers earn a living (and, crucially, to dissuade them from moving elsewhere).
