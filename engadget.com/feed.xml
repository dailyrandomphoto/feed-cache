But if you want to make your home office a more functional space, you should try to keep it neat and clutter-free as well. Here are a few recommendations from our staff that will help you organize your desk and hopefully be more productive as a result.</p><h2>Monitor risers</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8cd206a0-80e6-11eb-b37d-4bf60fd3a691" alt="Amazon Basics monitor riser" data-uuid="43d3cc21-616b-36c1-8de9-8f2abb89dfb4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure><p>We suggested getting an external monitor in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/work-from-home-essentials-irl-124500348.html" target="_self">previous WFH guide</a>, too, and for good reason. It seriously increases your screen real estate and is oftentimes easier on the eyes. However, not all monitors are height adjustable and they do take up quite a bit of desk space. A monitor stand or riser is a way to resolve that. A simple yet effective one is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3uNcFdc" target="_self">Amazon Basics model</a>, which has stackable legs for your desired height (up to 4-⅞ inches) plus an 11-inch wide storage space underneath to store your laptop or other knick knacks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If, on the other hand, you want something a little more stylish, this <a href="https://amzn.to/3rgoaYz" target="_self">bamboo monitor stand</a> from Stellar Importers is a particularly attractive one. It comes with compartments designed to fit your phone, coffee mug, stationary, notepads and more. There are also well-placed cut-outs to help manage your cords and cables. The legs attach together magnetically so it’s super easy to assemble. We should note that the height isn’t adjustable, but in my experience its 3.5-inch range was enough to raise our monitor to eye level. This particular model also works well as a laptop stand thanks to three holes designed for optimal heat ventilation.</p><p>If you really don’t want a monitor on your desk at all, consider a monitor arm. This is an especially good choice if you’re restless and need to change your monitor position frequently. One of our favorites is the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fjarvis-monitor-arm.html%3F&amp;xcust=CCT-SC-WFH-Fully" target="_self">Jarvis monitor arm by Fully</a>, which features a 360-degree swivel. It has a removable VESA plate and a clamp mount, plus the option of mounting the arm to grommet holes if your desk has them. It accommodates 13- to 32-inch monitors and can support a max weight of 19.8 pounds.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3uNcFdc" target="_self">Buy Amazon Basics monitor riser at Amazon - $23</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3rgoaYz" target="_self">Buy bamboo monitor riser at Amazon - $25</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fjarvis-monitor-arm.html%3F&amp;xcust=CCT-SC-WFH-Fully" target="_self">Buy Jarvis monitor arm at Fully - $99</a></p><h2>Laptop stands</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/f1943ef0-80e6-11eb-bddb-1d2ef0e830ca" alt="Rain Design iLevel2 Stand" data-uuid="03a772b6-4f77-3b14-a456-2567e49c2f84"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography</div></figure><p>If you’re using your laptop as-is on your desk or on your lap, you’re doing it wrong. Hunching your shoulders to look at your screen is harmful for your posture, which can lead to back, neck and arm pain if you’re not careful. Instead, you’ll want your screen to be at eye level, and if you don’t have an external monitor, that means elevating your laptop with a stand. This has the added benefit of giving you more desk space as well.</p><p>We particularly recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bfNeJK" target="_self">Rain Design iLevel2</a>. The height is easily adjustable thanks to a front slider, and its tilted design is also great for keeping your laptop cool. A slightly more affordable option is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bVjTDq" target="_self">Amazon Basics Laptop Stand</a>, and though it has a fixed height, there’s a cable organizer in the back that helps keep wires tucked away.</p><p>If you do own an external monitor but don’t have a lot of extra space, we recommend a vertical stand. <a href="https://amzn.to/3qdvJOh" target="_self">This one from Omoton</a> can hold your closed laptop upright, which goes a long way in keeping your desk organized. It has an adjustable width varying from 0.55 to 2.71 inches, which should fit most laptops. The stand itself is made from scratch-resistant anodized aluminum alloy and has a wide, heavy base that will prevent your laptop from tipping over.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3bfNeJK" target="_self">Buy Rain Design iLevel 2 at Amazon $51</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3bVjTDq" target="_self">Buy Amazon Basics laptop stand at Amazon - $22</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qdvJOh" target="_self">Buy Omoton vertical stand at Amazon - $22</a></p><h2>Laptop dock</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/43e405f0-80e7-11eb-bf46-9dfddd10fa68" alt="CalDigit TS3 Plus" data-uuid="e1677c6f-6abe-3d80-9ec3-86c242b64574"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CalDigit</div></figure><p>Most laptops only have a limited number of ports, which could mean juggling multiple cables and cords. With a dedicated laptop docking station like the <a href="https://amzn.to/3sM0BHq" target="_self">CalDigit TS3 Plus</a>, however, you might never have to do that again. By attaching your laptop to the TS3 Plus, one Thunderbolt 3 port can turn into 15. That includes six USB ports (one USB-A and one USB-C), Gigabit Ethernet, an SD card slot, optical audio, a 3.5mm jack, a DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 3 port. It offers up to 87 watts of power to charge your laptop and you can connect up to two 4K monitors via DisplayPort and Thunderbolt 3. It can be positioned vertically or horizontally so it will likely fit in most desk setups.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3sM0BHq" target="_self">Buy CalDigit TS3 Plus at Amazon - $250</a></p><h2>Phone chargers</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a749cc70-80f0-11eb-b3fc-5dad1aa33886" alt="Mophie 3-in-1 charger" data-uuid="b55cd0ed-37e1-344c-a899-9b9acc0306c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mophie</div></figure><p>A dedicated phone stand is a great way to keep your desk clutter-free while charging your handset at the same time. If you have a phone without wireless charging, we recommend the <a href="https://amzn.to/3bWqk9g" target="_self">Lamicall stand</a>, as it has a feeder hole for the charger cord on the back. The stand is made from a high-quality aluminum alloy and the cradle can be tilted back and forth for different viewing angles. If you like, you can position your phone horizontally to watch videos.</p><p>If you do have a phone with wireless charging, we strongly recommend using a wireless charger so you don’t have to mess around with pesky cords. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3kKuTHD" target="_self">Anker PowerWave Stand</a> is a good option as it supports 10W high-speed charging with the latest Samsung Galaxy handsets and 5W charging with the iPhone 12. We especially like how affordable it is ($16 as of this writing), though keep in mind that you need to supply your own power brick.</p><p>If you want to charge an iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch all at once, consider a multi-device charger. One of our favorites is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3qeKIrh" target="_self">Mophie 3-in-1 wireless charging stand</a>, thanks to its compact form factor. We like that it has a small divot that was designed perfectly to hold an AirPods case so that there’s no risk of misalignment. Another excellent choice is the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fchargers%2Fpowered-wireless-charging-3-in-1-dock.950-000015.html&amp;xcust=CCT-SW-WFH-Logi" target="_self">Logitech Powered 3-in-1 Dock</a>, which could potentially be great for couples or those of you who own two handsets. That’s because the flat surface area for the AirPods case can also be used to charge a second phone.</p><p>One way to really save some space is to get a lamp with a wireless charger built into the base. The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fhektar-work-lamp-w-charging-led-bulb-dark-gray-20416239%2F&amp;xcust=CCT-SC-WFH-Ikea" target="_self">IKEA Hektar</a> has a classic look with a 5W induction charger, plus an extra USB port so you can charge two devices at once. For a more futuristic design, the <a href="https://amzn.to/3uWmh5F" target="_self">Taotronics LED desk lamp’s</a> slim style might be more your speed. It supports fast charging up to 7.5 watts (for iPhones) or 10 watts (for Samsung Galaxy phones) an extra USB port on the side; five different color temperatures; and an option for a one-hour dimmable desk lamp timer that’ll turn off when you go to bed.</p><p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3bWqk9g" target="_self">Buy Lamicall stand at Amazon - $14</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3kKuTHD" target="_self">Buy Anker PowerWave Stand at Amazon - $19</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qeKIrh" target="_self">Buy Mophie 3-in-1 stand at Amazon - $106</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fchargers%2Fpowered-wireless-charging-3-in-1-dock.950-000015.html&amp;xcust=CCT-SW-WFH-Logi" target="_self">Buy 3-in-1 dock at Logitech - $100</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=72705X1521812&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fhektar-work-lamp-w-charging-led-bulb-dark-gray-20416239%2F&amp;xcust=CCT-SC-WFH-Ikea" target="_self">Buy Hektar at IKEA - $65</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3uWmh5F" target="_self">Buy Taotronics LED lamp at Amazon - $60</a></p><h2>Standing desk converter</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/accd0390-80f2-11eb-bf7c-d2bc223bd9ae" alt="Cora from Fully" data-uuid="087a4a57-837f-3153-ad75-9d01e13e873b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fully</div></figure><p>For those who want to get into standing desks but don’t have the money or space, a standing desk converter is a great alternative.

A simple way to overcome that is with a few simple cable management tools. The easiest would be to use either twist ties or <a href="https://amzn.to/3bfpa9A" target="_self">Velcro wrap ties like these</a>, which are strong, reusable and affordable. Another option is to use a cord management organizer like <a href="https://amzn.to/3qoZU5r" target="_self">these cable clips</a>. They let you organize seven cables with a single clip, which you can then attach to your desk or wall with a self-adhesive backing.

The trademark all-white earbuds boast excellent true wireless sound, courtesy of active noise cancellation (ANC) and silicone tips that come in three sizes to help &quot;seal&quot; in sound. For those locked into Apple&#39;s ecosystem, there&#39;s the added benefit of quick pairing that lets you connect rapidly and switch easily between your MacBook, iPhone and iPad. Plus, their IPX4 rating means they are sweat and water resistant, making them a good fit for the gym or home workouts.</p><p>In terms of the design, Apple shortened the stem on the Pro earbuds to make them more compact compared to the entry-level <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-03-apple-airpods-review-2019-more-of-the-same.html" target="_self">AirPods</a>. It also widened and shortened the case that gives you about an hour of use with five minutes of charging. Overall, the battery life lasts five hours, but drops to 4.5 hours of listening or 3.5 hours of talk time when you turn on ANC.&nbsp;</p><p>While <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-next-gen-airpods-pro-smaller-design-121846608.html" target="_self">reports</a> have started to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-generation-leak-205121774.html" target="_self">emerge</a> of refreshed AirPods slated for this year, those will inevitably cost more at the outset. So, if you need a replacement pair of earbuds now, or you&#39;re ready to upgrade from the original AirPods, the Pros are still your best bet.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals" target="_self"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-sale-woot-130642507.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c33b31d6-9344-4954-a57d-1264200da558</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 13:06:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615381626</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T13:07:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/33c6d030-81a0-11eb-b8fe-257a84809209" width="674" height="450" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/33c6d030-81a0-11eb-b8fe-257a84809209" width="674" height="450" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok adds new comment controls to discourage bullying]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TikTok is introducing new features meant to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/new-tools-to-promote-kindness" target="_self"><ins>reduce bullying</ins></a> and harassment on its platform: new comment controls and in-app prompts to discourage nasty comments.</p><p>The app is expanding its comment filtering tools to give users the ability to approve all new comments before they can appear underneath their clips.

The latest series is dubbed ROG Phone 5 (skipping the &quot;4&quot; due to tetraphobia; you obviously don&#39;t want to associate gaming with death), and while it may appear to merely don some minor cosmetic changes, the innards have been completely revamped for better heat dissipation, weight distribution and audio performance. As a bonus, there&#39;s also a Pro model plus a limited edition ROG Phone 5 Ultimate, with the latter boasting a whopping 18GB of RAM.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="5cbdb8c8-a208-4c23-a783-942e56d8bd66"/><p>Let&#39;s get the basics out of the way first. In addition to the processor, all three models share the same 6.78-inch Samsung E4 AMOLED display, which packs the same 144Hz refresh rate as before (so Nubia wins this round with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nubia-red-magic-6-pro-165hz-display-internal-fan-18gb-ram-071339839.html" target="_self">165Hz</a>), but with a slightly taller 2,448 x 1,080 resolution and a slightly faster 300Hz touch sampling rate — giving you an edge over other gamers in terms of responsiveness and accuracy. For those who are wondering, ASUS says there are now <a href="https://zentalk.asus.com/en/discussion/36042/rog-phone-3-list-of-games-supporting-above-60-fps-gameplay" target="_self">over 200 games</a> that support 144Hz refresh rate, with titles including <em>Rockman X Dive</em>, <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Shadowgun Legends</em> and more.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>ASUS claims this panel is also 23 percent brighter (up to 800 nits across the entire panel), while pushing the dimmest setting to 5 nits with minimal distortion — the latter making a notable difference in the dark areas in videos. It&#39;s also rated with a wide 111-percent DCI-P3 gamut, 150.89-percent sRGB gamut, Delta-E of &lt;1 accuracy and HDR10+ support. And yes, there&#39;s still an optical in-display fingerprint reader here.</p><p>As much as I enjoy the display improvements, it wasn&#39;t until I started a game of <em>PUBG</em> that I noticed this screen has rounder corners than before, which cut off some info and buttons. Luckily, I could go into the game&#39;s graphics settings and tweak the &quot;non-standard screens&quot; parameter, but this may become a problem for other titles that lack such option.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb3dc9b0-8190-11eb-9ffd-3ecb282bec63" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="758531ad-4105-3d5c-a453-8e3a9e3c526b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Another less obvious but notable upgrade applied to the ROG Phone 5 is the ultrasonic shoulder trigger feature. The new AirTrigger 5 buttons pack more sensors (nine instead of seven) into the same space for improved sensitivity and accuracy, and they are now placed closer to the edges to accommodate smaller hands. Like before, each AirTrigger support swipe gestures, slide gestures (both horizontal and vertical), continuous trigger (long press to simulate multiple clicks) and dual partitioning, giving you a wide range of customizable options. Though personally, I find that the good old default mode is already sufficient for my first-person shooters.</p><p>While most smartphones feature an L-shaped logic board with the processor placed near the top, ASUS found a way to place the Snapdragon 888 right in the middle of the ROG Phone 5 — far away from both hands when in landscape mode. This is mainly thanks to MMT (Middle Middle Tab) battery technology which features a higher energy density, thus allowing for a split cell design without sacrificing the generous 6,000mAh total battery capacity. As a bonus, the two cells also offer better weight distribution and thermal control — up to 7 degrees Celsius lower battery temperature when using 30W charging, and up to 3 degrees Celsius lower when using 65W (as bundled with the ROG Phone 5), according to ASUS.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb278290-8190-11eb-9feb-1059fbbb859a" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="f6794b74-f611-3290-9391-c9df87690fd5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>This new internal layout, along with the taller body, thinner display panel, new side-mounted port and lack of an external 5G modem (thanks to the Snapdragon 888), allowed ASUS to squeeze extra space into the ROG Phone 5&#39;s front-facing stereo speakers. These have the same 1.2cc chamber space each, thus allowing for a symmetrical audio performance as well as improved richness (the ROG Phone 3 actually had a smaller speaker chamber on one side). On top of that, the new Cirrus Logic CS35L45 mono amp driving each 7-magnet 12x16mm speaker is apparently 21-percent more powerful than before. (It&#39;s also worth noting that the ROG Phone 5 still has quad-mic noise cancellation.)</p><p>Hardware alone doesn&#39;t complete the puzzle, though. Following the impressive results on the ROG Phone 3, ASUS continued its partnership with Dirac for audio tuning on the ROG Phone 5. The Swedish audio specialist has since come up with a dedicated solution for smartphones, which apparently resulted in more accurate calibrations for dampening distortion, enhancing the perceived bass, widening the soundstage and more on this new gaming phone. ASUS even tapped into Dirac&#39;s MIMO (Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output) technologies — previously reserved for luxury cars only — to co-optimize both speakers as one system for a better overall acoustical response.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb278291-8190-11eb-bbdd-100eb11ddfb6" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 3 vs ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="591cc7de-aa8f-3c4a-bdb7-48234c46e9e2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>In a quick comparison with the ROG Phone 3 and the ROG Phone 5, the audio improvement was noticeable. In the rainy Tokyo scene where Natasha found Hawkeye in <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, everything sounded shallower on the older phone, with the tinny rainfall noise dominating the dialog and music. The ROG Phone 5, on the other hand, sounded louder, richer and deeper. The difference was rather surprising, given how impressed I already was with the ROG Phone 3. Then I realized I could enable a &quot;cinema&quot; option in the AudioWizard&#39;s new &quot;scenario effect&quot; setting, which further boosted the perceived bass.</p><p>ASUS hasn&#39;t forgotten headphone users who still prefer the good old 3.5mm jack. The ROG Phone 5 has gained an ESS Sabre ES9280AC Pro Quad DAC, which can apparently deliver a &quot;best-in-class&quot; signal-to-noise ratio of 130 dB, and can also drive headphones with slightly higher impedance (over 50 ohm) using 2Vrms output. This should pair well with the newly released ROG Cetra II Core earbuds, which offer a seemingly impressive 20Hz-40kHz range. But if you want a wireless option, ASUS is also releasing the ROG Strix Go BT II today, which offers up to 45 hours of battery life along with AI noise cancellation.</p><p>On the photography side, you&#39;ll also find the same set of cameras across the ROG Phone 5 series. In fact, the four shooters are identical to the ones on the ROG Phone 3. The rear trio include a 64MP f/1.8 main camera (Sony IMX686 sensor), a 13MP f/2.4 125-degree ultra-wide camera and a 5MP f/2.0 macro camera, whereas the front side feature a 24MP f/2.45 selfie cam.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb465530-8190-11eb-b97b-6ad487fee250" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="a6b90d66-1b63-3556-b5c1-9117de94e449"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>Things get a little more interesting with the ROG Phone 5 Pro and limited ROG Phone 5 Ultimate. The first thing you&#39;ll notice is the small &quot;ROG Vision&quot; PMOLED color screen on the rear side, which lets you display customizable graphics for incoming calls, charging, gaming and other scenarios. With the Ultimate edition, ASUS picked a bold move by equipping it with a monochrome rear screen to go with its matte white finish. Furthermore, both models offer two additional capacitive touch areas on the rear panel, in case you still need more mappable buttons for your hardcore gaming.</p><p>Speaking of, it&#39;s worth pointing out that the updated Game Genie app here offers an &quot;Esports Mode,&quot; which enables &quot;do not disturb&quot; but disables all key mapping, macros, quick controls and more (so no AirTriggers and no rear touch panels). This may come in handy for tournament organizers who want more control over a fair game. Game Genie also now offers audio haptics to select games (namely <em>PUBG</em>), which automatically maps specific sounds like, say, shooting, to haptic feedback, and different weapons provide different feel to make the game more immersive. But again, Esports Mode disables audio haptics.</p><p>Much like the Nubia <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nubia-red-magic-6-pro-165hz-display-internal-fan-18gb-ram-071339839.html" target="_self">Red Magic 6 Pro</a> &quot;Dao&quot; edition, the ROG Phone 5 Ultimate even offers a generous 18GB of LPDDR5 RAM (supplied by SK Hynix), though it shares the same 512GB UFS 3.1 storage as the 5 Pro, which packs 16GB of RAM. The Ultimate edition will also come with a gift box containing a baseball cap, a towel, a deck of playing cards, badges, stickers, mask cover and more.</p><p>ASUS rarely failed us when it came to the range of accessories for the ROG Phone series, but with the ROG Phone 5, it finally decided to retire the dual-screen TwinView Dock and Mobile Desktop Dock. ASUS admitted that these two devices were simply too pricey, which was probably a hint at weak adoption.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb3dc9b4-8190-11eb-9b7f-e6c43d247ae2" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="fd31d2cd-c1db-37f2-b6d2-43e72d2229ad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>On the other hand, ASUS made a new AeroActive Cooler 5 which now blows directly at the hot spot, thanks to the repositioning of the processor. The company claims that this clip-on fan, with assistance from the vapor cooling chamber and graphite sheets on the inside, delivers up to 10 degrees Celsius lower CPU temperature, as well as up to 15 degrees Celsius lower surface temperature. On top of that, not only does this attachment still double as a kickstand, it adds two physical buttons as well. In other words, this means with the AeroActive Cooler 5, you get a total of four mappable buttons on the rear side of the Pro and Ultimate editions. Alas, if you&#39;re getting the regular ROG Phone 5, you&#39;ll have to buy this fan separately.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb2f4ac0-8190-11eb-babe-fc38cc24f7e1" alt="ASUS ROG Phone 5" data-uuid="8795f407-29a1-3248-a3d6-639898dcb665"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Richard Lai/Engadget</div></figure><p>The ROG Phone 5 series also supports the Switch-like Kunai 3 Gamepad, so long as you have the updated version which comes with a bumper that fits the slightly longer body. Other optional accessories include the ROG Gaming Clip for attaching console controllers (for Xbox, PlayStation and Stadia), the new ROG Lighting Armor Case 3 (which utilizes the pogo pins on the redesigned side-mounted port) and the ASUS Professional Dock (for HDMI and USB expansion).</p><p>It appears that ASUS has once again delivered a well-thought-out package for mobile gamers, thanks to its engineering focus on audio performance, buttons, and cooling, with the Pro and Ultimate editions&#39; ROG Vision screen serving as the cherry on the cake. We&#39;re waiting for confirmation on a US launch for the ROG Phone 5 series, but for now, we do know that the regular version is launching this month, ranging from 799 euros (8GB RAM and 128GB storage) to 999 euros (16GB+256GB) in Europe. The Pro edition will launch in April for 1,199 euros (16GB RAM+512GB), followed by the Ultimate edition in May with a 1,299 euros price tag (18GB+512GB).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-5-gaming-phone-112327496.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4862f7b-db59-40f8-93e6-f18523a268b0</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 10 Mar 2021 11:23:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615375743</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T11:29:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb118990-8190-11eb-a7cb-0209a9b20bc6" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cb118990-8190-11eb-a7cb-0209a9b20bc6" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Richard Lai/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Phone 5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS ROG Phone 5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram Lite reboot squeezes the app into a 2MB package]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is today relaunching Instagram Lite, a stripped-down version of the image-sharing app designed for users in emerging markets. Developed by Facebook’s team in Tel Aviv, the birthplace of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-08-facebook-lite-app-update.html" target="_self">Facebook Lite</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-04-28-facebooks-messenger-lite-expands-to-132-more-countries.html" target="_self">Messenger Lite</a>, the app’s package size is just 2MB. The team said that the focus, like with the other launches, was on users whose smartphones lack storage capacity, processing power and reliable data. In order to reach that size, the app focuses on images, video and messaging, ditching other features and flourishes that fade into the background on the full-fat version of the app.</p><p>Instagram Lite still has the main feed, as well as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-08-instagram-camera.html" target="_self">Stories</a> — the ephemeral messaging feature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-10-instagram-added-snapchat-features-at-zuckerberg-request.html" target="_self">cribbed</a> from Snapchat — but not IG Live or Shopping. Engineering manager Gal Zellermayer said that, as well as live filters and other AR effects that wouldn’t work on low-power devices, animations have been edited down. He cited the example of the cube animation seen when swiping between different users’ Stories, a very processor and data-intensive transition that didn’t work well on older devices, which has been removed. Zellermayer added that a lot of extra compression work is handled on the server side to relieve the burden off the device itself.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Michelle Lourie, product manager, explained that there were a number of additional UI tweaks to better suit “new digital users.” This included ditching a trash can to represent a delete icon, in favor of an X, which testers found made more sense.

The 30,000-square-meter facility will be home to the iPhone maker&#39;s expanding cellular division, which is tasked with building 5G and future wireless technologies such as modems. Apple says the building in Munich&#39;s city center will run on 100 percent renewable energy, like its other global offices. It is preparing to move into the new European site in 2022, with plans to spend the €1 billion over the next three years, according to a <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/newsroom/2021/03/apple-to-invest-over-1-billion-euros-in-germany-with-new-munich-campus/" target="_self">blog post</a>.</p><p>Munich is Apple&#39;s largest engineering hub in Europe, so the expansion makes sense, with roughly 4,000 employees and some 1,500 engineers from 40 countries working on power management design and application processors.

It&#39;s IP67-rated, protecting it from dust and from being submerged in water for up to 30 minutes. Inside are two Class-H amplifiers, one mid-woofer and one tweeter, and the Roam supports adjustable EQ using the companion app. You&#39;ll be able to pair two Roam speakers together for stereo sound and connect the new speaker to existing Sonos devices you may have around your home.</p><p>But similarly to the Move, the Roam can play music via Bluetooth or WiFi and it supports a plethora of streaming apps including Spotify, Apple Music and others. You&#39;re also able to use Apple AirPlay 2 with it and control the device using either Amazon&#39;s Alexa or the Google Assistant. The Roam uses Sonos&#39; Automatic Trueplay tuning to adapt sound to your environment, and it&#39;ll be able to use the company&#39;s new Sound Swap feature. This lets you press and hold the play/pause button to swap the music to the closest Sonos speaker to you, making it easier to move sound with you from room to room.</p><p>When it comes to power, the Roam charges via USB-C or via any Qi-compatible wireless charging pad. The speaker comes with a charging cable, but Sonos will also sell a separate, wireless dock for $49. The company promises up to 10 hours of playback on a single charge, or 10 days of life when in sleep mode.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-sonos-roam-portable-speaker-pricing-availability-210216248.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fb66edf2-e999-49a2-8a16-16925f077427</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 21:02:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615324229</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T21:10:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/bd29b7a0-811b-11eb-af76-c93781e37de7" width="1336" height="848" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/bd29b7a0-811b-11eb-af76-c93781e37de7" width="1336" height="848" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sonos]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Sonos Roam speaker on a plain grey background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sonos Roam]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Roam is Sonos' cheapest and most portable speaker yet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div><iframe src="https://delivery.vidible.tv/htmlembed/pid=58658323cb65d3130116cded/5514392d09eab105804dc00c.html?vid=6047f6e8d129535d963095aa&amp;m.playback=autoplay&amp;m.disable_moat=1" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Today, Sonos revealed its least expensive, most portable speaker yet, the Roam. It’s a follow-up of sorts to the Move, the company’s first portable speaker which debuted in 2019. That speaker may have Bluetooth and a battery, but its relatively large size and heavy weight meant it wasn’t exactly a grab-and-go device. The Roam, on the other hand, is made with portability first in mind, putting it in competition with speakers like the <a href="https://amzn.to/3rJ4Of3" target="_self">UE Boom 3</a> and the <a href="https://amzn.to/3vbx2ko" target="_self">JBL Flip 5</a>.</p><p>My first impression of the Roam is that it’s a portable speaker first that can also be used at home. The Move, on the other hand, is a larger speaker built for the home that you can also take with you. It’s a subtle but important difference in how the Roam was conceived. <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/roam.html" target="_self">The $169 Roam</a> is a full-fledged Sonos device, which means when you’re home and connected to WiFi, it works just like any other Sonos speaker. You can group it with other Sonos devices; stream audio from dozens of services; take two Roams and pair them in stereo; use Google Assistant or Alexa for voice control; and stream from Apple devices using AirPlay 2.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8325e120-80f6-11eb-86bf-36e3e363721f" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="218e7d04-1210-3600-b2bc-a98c1202f5d0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>But like the Move, the Roam also has Bluetooth on board, which means you can pair a device and stream music to it when you’re away from a WiFi network. Its built-in battery is rated for 10 hours of playback, and it automatically goes into a low-power sleep mode when it’s not in use. It should last about 10 days in sleep mode.</p><p>Obviously, being able to link the Roam into a system of Sonos products is a plus for people already in the Sonos ecosystem, but it also has a lot of clever features that further separate it from other portables. For example, the Roam can automatically switch between Bluetooth and WiFi. Once you’ve paired it with your phone, it’ll remember that pairing and be set to go when you take it out of the home. Likewise, when you return it’ll rejoin your WiFi network without prompting. This is an improvement over the Move, which required manual switching between Bluetooth and WiFi.</p><section data-eng-breakout="beae9b3d00af40d498cae1071b28bfe2" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/9d6c1b30-80f6-11eb-b9fb-a0ddd48d59e4" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="0839bc68-ac90-36fa-98cb-63f356b61730"></section><p>This speaks to the philosophy Sonos has for the Roam, which is making it simple to use both at and away from home. The Bluetooth-only speaker market is already pretty crowded,” Maxime Bouvat-Merlin, the company’s senior VP of hardware development,” said in an interview ahead of the company’s launch event. “For us, going into this specific market, we had to do more than just put Bluetooth and great sound into these products. We thought really hard about how to bring the Sonos experience from in the home to outside the home.”</p><p>That’s the inspiration behind things like the new “Sound Swap” feature. If you’re playing music on the Roam and want to bounce it to another Sonos speaker, pressing and holding the play button will search for the nearest speaker and send the music to it. The idea is to keep the music flowing from away from home into the home.</p><p>Sound Swap makes use of some intriguing technology. “Pressing and holding play/pause signals the other players to emit an ultra high frequency sound that only Roam can hear,&quot; Hadley Simmons, a product marketing manager at Sonos, explained to Engadget. “Roam can pick up those chirps with its microphones and detect the nearest speaker. It’s basically an easier way to move music throughout your home without having to go back to the Sonos app and sort through your different rooms.” In the same vein, if the Roam is playing music via Bluetooth, you can hold the play button and it’ll automatically stream that music to other Sonos speakers — effectively turning the Roam into a Bluetooth line-in to the rest of your system.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/1538bf10-80f7-11eb-affd-772df6bfe86e" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="b64e72bb-d8a1-38da-b2b0-15fcc2f96dea"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>The technology for Sound Swap came out of the Sonos advanced technology group, a team that came together in the last few years. “In the past, we’d try and innovate in the product development process, but that’s the worst place to try and do it when you have a specific schedule and deadlines in front of you,” Bouvat-Merlin said. “So I created a special, standalone group that works on things for two, three, four years down the road.”</p><p>All these features are meaningless if people don’t want to take the Roam with them, which means its physical design is probably more important here than with standard home speakers. Based on what we’ve seen so far, the Roam looks compact and easy to move. It weighs less than a pound, and Sonos described it as about the same size as a water bottle. The idea is for it to be small and light enough that you don’t need to think about taking it with you; it just becomes a habit. I haven’t used it yet, but I could definitely imagine it being the kind of thing I’d toss in a bag when I leave the house, whether for a quick trip or a cross-country flight (when that’s doable, anyway).</p><p>As usual, there are some smart Sonos flourishes here. The speaker can be used in vertical or horizontal orientation. It detects which way it’s positioned and adjusts the sound accordingly. It’s compatible with all Qi wireless chargers, or you can simply use the included USB-C cable. Sonos is making its own magnetic wireless charger, but unfortunately it’s a $50 extra rather than something included in the box.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/cfbb4980-80f6-11eb-bff9-ab189a68b42d" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="d4c92a9a-b41e-32e4-8354-dff56cdf7ee3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>The Roam is also rated IP67 for dust and water resistance. In fact, it can be submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and still work. The Move has superior resistance to temperature fluctuations, but it can’t be dunked in water. Given other companies have speakers that can even float in a pool, the fact that the Roam can survive a trip underwater is crucial.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Roam needs to sound good — no small feat, given its diminutive size. I haven’t listened to it, but. Simmons said users should expect sound quality comparable to the larger Sonos One speaker, albeit without the same max volume. But the bass presence is said to be much larger than you’d expect out of a speaker that small. Of course, we’ll need to wait to hear it for ourselves, but given what companies like Amazon, Google and Apple have done with their own relatively small speakers, I’m hopefully Sonos has worked its magic on the tiny Roam.</p><p>As usual for Sonos, the Roam features a number of custom internal components, like the so-called “racetrack” mid-woofer. Since a traditional circular design wouldn’t work in the slim, tall Roam, Sonos went with this oval shape to maximize its size. It also has a dedicated tweeter and two class-H amplifiers. Fitting both a tweeter and mid-woofer into the Roam rather than using one all-purpose driver should make a significant difference in audio quality.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/d65cde60-80f7-11eb-b7f5-34f88a25170b" alt="Sonos Roam" data-uuid="770d0e5a-280a-34ed-8ae7-6874cfa78ddb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>Sonos also included the “Auto Trueplay” speaker-tuning technology it first built into the Move. This means the speaker will use its built-in microphone array to listen to its output and optimize the sound for wherever it’s placed. Trueplay has been available for Sonos speakers since 2015, but they require an iOS device to use to manually tune the device. Not so for the Move and the Roam, and the Roam takes things a step further this time. It’ll be able to tune itself even when you’re not on WiFi, using profiles built directly into the speaker hardware itself.</p><p>The Roam is entering a crowded market, but it’s priced competitively, even if it’s still more expensive than many Bluetooth-only devices. It does offer a load of features if you’re already a Sonos user — but its low price also makes it a gateway drug to the Sonos ecosystem if you’ve never tried their products. We’ll need to take a listen before we can judge if Sonos hit the mark, but from what we know so far it’s looking like a compelling option in the ultraportable speaker category. Pre-orders for the Roam are open now on the Sonos website, and the speaker will be available on April 20th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonos-roam-portable-bluetooth-wifi-speaker-specs-price-release-date-210042690.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">148da868-4e1a-4a10-ad25-910e70211e64</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 21:00:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615381847</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T13:11:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/f235b170-811a-11eb-b7fd-5081ce7ba36c" width="2000" height="1249" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/f235b170-811a-11eb-b7fd-5081ce7ba36c" width="2000" height="1249" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sonos]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman lays on a blanket in the park, with a phone in one hand and the Sonos Roam speaker in the other.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sonos Roam]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile will start automatically enrolling customers in an ad targeting program]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a T-Mobile subscriber, you’ll soon be automatically enrolled in a program that will see your online and device usage data sold to advertisers. In a <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/privacy-center/our-practices/privacy-policy" target="_self">privacy policy update</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-to-step-up-ad-targeting-of-cellphone-customers-11615285803" target="_self"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the carrier said it would start sharing that information with marketing agencies starting April 26th unless customers opt out. “We’ve heard many say they prefer more relevant ads so we’re defaulting to this setting,” a spokesperson for T-Mobile told the <em>WSJ</em>. The new policy will include everyone who came over to T-Mobile through the carrier’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-t-mobile-completes-sprint-merger.html" target="_self">2020 merger with Sprint</a>. That’s notable because Sprint previously allowed its customers to opt into sharing their data with advertisers.</p><p>T-Mobile’s decision to enroll as many of its customers as possible in a program that sells their data to advertisers runs counter to what we’ve seen from tech giants like Google and Apple recently. It was only earlier this month the former said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ads-user-data-tracking-cookies-144445173.html" target="_self">stop selling ads</a> that rely on a person’s browsing history, and not build any cross app tracking tools in the future. Apple, meanwhile, will soon require developers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-privacy-updates-wwdc-2020-181218381.html" target="_self">explicitly obtain a person’s permission</a> before they track them across websites and applications. It’s even a step beyond the data collection AT&amp;T and Verizon (Engadget’s parent company) currently run. While both carriers automatically enroll their subscribers in programs that pool them into shared interest groups, as an AT&amp;T or Verizon customer, you don’t have to go out of your way to prevent your wireless provider from sharing more detailed information on you.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can opt out of the advertising program by opening the T-Mobile app on your phone, tapping the “More” tab and then going into the “Advertising &amp; Analytics” section. Switch the toggle next to the “Use my data to make ads more relevant to me” option to off.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-ad-targeting-program-205736695.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">506555d7-9662-43c6-9173-6232d4650795</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 20:57:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615323710</ingested><modified>2021-03-09T21:02:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/4147b9f0-8118-11eb-8beb-73745f3cd64e" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/4147b9f0-8118-11eb-8beb-73745f3cd64e" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[helen89 via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[New York, July 19, 2018: People walking by a T Mobile store in Manhattan.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[People walking by a T Mobile store in Manhattan.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram starts rolling out an auto-caption sticker for Stories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-live-rooms-160002273.html" target="_self">Instagram</a> is taking a step forward for accessibility with the rollout of automatic captions on Stories.

Iron Gate’s Viking survival sim rocketed up the charts, hitting <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3055101388621224471" target="_self">5 million copies sold</a> after just one month in Early Access and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2021/02/22/valheim-500000-concurrent-players-steam-record/" target="_self">surpassing huge titles</a> like <em>Dota 2</em> in terms of concurrent active players.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/892970/Valheim/#app_reviews_hash" target="_self">Steam reviews</a> for <em>Valheim</em> exude a palpable sense of awe and relief. Players regularly compare the feeling to the first time they played <em>Minecraft</em>, marveling at the game’s scope, depth and atmosphere, and questioning how a team of just five developers managed to pack such an engrossing experience into a 1GB download. <em>Valheim</em> sets players loose in an original realm of Viking purgatory, a vast, procedurally generated world filled with mythical Norse beasts, high seas, hunting and crafting. It’s dense yet forgiving; action-packed yet peaceful.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To date, Iron Gate has sold more than 5.7 million copies of <em>Valheim</em>. There are still only five people on the development team.</p><p>“We’re doing our best,” Iron Gate co-founder Henrik Tornqvist told Engadget. “It has become pretty hectic around here since launch.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e53bdcd0-8104-11eb-9f79-d2f0cb5fc299" alt="Valheim" data-uuid="c97e21fa-e57a-336d-95a5-49f25d2506f1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Iron Gate</div></figure><p>Tornqvist and studio co-founder Richard Svensson are looking to hire a few more people, including a QA manager to handle the influx of bug reports from millions of new beta testers. Otherwise, it’s getting support from Coffee Stain Publishing — the folks responsible for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-06-goats-are-jerks-goat-simulator-proves-it.html" target="_self"><em>Goat Simulator</em></a>,<em></em>a veritable granddaddy of viral video games.</p><p>Svensson began working on <em>Valheim </em>in 2017, as a side hustle. By day, he and Tornqvist were colleagues at Swedish studio Pieces Interactive, but by early 2018, Svensson had left to focus fully on <em>Valheim</em>.</p><p>“At the end of 2018 I also left to join forces with him,” Tornqvist said. “We founded the company Iron Gate in April 2019, and by then we pretty much knew where we wanted to take <em>Valheim</em>.”</p><section data-eng-breakout="f0f6346669604e0b8a3c9473a04d8db3" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/1c708d90-8105-11eb-bfde-d503c15c8518" alt="Valheim" data-uuid="38a78a3d-c6d3-3c29-8fbe-0830f69667da"></section><p>Despite their faith in the core ideas behind <em>Valheim</em>, neither Svensson nor Tornqvist expected the game to explode in popularity the way it has. This is clear in <a href="http://irongatestudio.se/news/2020/01/01/goodbye-2019-hello-2020/" target="_self">an Iron Gate blog post</a> published on January 1st, 2020, a full year before <em>Valheim</em>’s Early Access launch. In the entry, Svensson recaps the game’s development progress, officially welcomes Tornqvist to the team, and celebrates the birth of his son. It’s soaked in optimism from the first line (edited for clarity):</p><blockquote><p>It’s Jan 1st, 2020, and I’m a bit hungover =). I will try to write a quick summary of this year’s happenings related to me and <em>Valheim</em>. It’s been an eventful year for sure. Crazy eventful to be honest. I have probably aged like 10 years this year. So here we go =). ...We quickly registered a new limited liability company and in the last minute I came up with the name Iron Gate! I like the idea that our logo is a gateway to other worlds. What lies beyond the iron gate?</p></blockquote><p>Truly, Svensson and Tornqvist had no idea.</p><p>“We did feel modestly confident in that we had a game that would see some success and provide the means for us to continue development through the Early Access-period, but nothing on the scale of the success we’ve actually had,” Tornqvist said. “It is a bit crazy actually, a once-in-a-lifetime hit, I think.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/e569f1b0-8104-11eb-87f2-1501775fc25e" alt="Valheim" data-uuid="0507262c-72da-36f8-9ce6-c808e6407c87"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Iron Gate</div></figure><p>Tornqvist said he’s particularly enjoying all of the community-created content that’s spawned out of <em>Valheim</em>, including the memes, which he called “delicious.” Svensson and Tornqvist are hurrying to hire some more hands, and Iron Gate developers are focused on squashing bugs and continuing to support <em>Valheim</em> through Early Access, promising plenty of new content in 2021.</p><p>“Not to sound too corny, but we’re just very happy that so many people are enjoying the game really,” Tornqvist said. “So a big thank you to all the people who have taken the game to heart.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/valheim-five-weeks-interview-steam-early-access-indie-184539795.html]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d2d991d9-21aa-41c3-b7e8-d5b900f812d1</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 09 Mar 2021 18:45:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1615315543</ingested><modified>2021-03-10T01:59:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8c8327b0-8104-11eb-967d-d153066430d0" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8c8327b0-8104-11eb-967d-d153066430d0" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Iron Gate]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Valheim]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Valheim]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
