Like, <em>really</em>.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/aliens-fireteam-cold-iron-announcement-online-shooter-150024353.html"><em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is an online, co-op, third-person survival shooter from Cold Iron Studios, and it’s been in development for the past six years. Cold Iron was actually bought and sold four times starting in 2018, bringing its mysterious Alien-based game along for the ride. In the end, Cold Iron has cut a deal with 20th Century Studios to self-publish <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>, and it’s due to hit Steam, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles on August 24th, priced at $40.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d7b5d30-e9a6-11eb-b556-e013e611f324" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite" data-uuid="d24fe6dd-afdf-30d2-ad05-ad97cd1ee80b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">20th Century Studios</div></figure><p>I had the chance to play a preview build of <em>Fireteam Elite</em> that included access to two of the four campaigns, and four of the five character classes: gunner, technician, demolisher and doc (the final class is recon). Each campaign consists of three missions filled with AI-powered Xenomorph hordes, with three difficulty levels unlocked from the start. Every mission requires three players, and empty team slots are filled by bots named Alpha and Beta, which honestly end up functioning more like mobile turrets than actual teammates.</p><p>So, after playing hours of the preview with friends and bots alike, here’s my conclusion: <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em> is a generic survival shooter with old-school arcade DNA. <em>Fireteam Elite</em> feels like an online, updated version of light-gun games like <em>Area 51</em> or <em>House of the Dead</em>, complete with repetitive environments and sloppy hit boxes. The game is competent, but not dynamic. To put it simply — man, it’s <em>just </em>a shooting gallery down there.</p><p>To be fair, that’s what survival shooters are all about. Enter a new area, prepare your defenses, kill the swarm, rinse and repeat. The thing is, <em>Fireteam Elite</em> deploys this formula in such a rigid structure that missions quickly become predictable, no matter how many bugs show up. What’s more, the generic sci-fi environments blend together after a few playthroughs, and tricks like falling ceiling panels and sudden bursts of steam lose their effectiveness well before the first mission is over.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6eb7a0c029074a3780b16f9ce49e0a51" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d7a72d1-e9a6-11eb-b791-6b6592190957" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite"></section><p><em>Fireteam Elite</em> fails to build tension. With such a transparent gameplay structure, any feeling of pressure or horror has to come from the xenomorphs themselves, and frankly, they’re often not smart enough to make this happen. The swarms rarely feel unmanageable and the specialized xenomorphs, like spitters or jumpers, routinely behave in non-threatening ways. This unpredictability ends up being more adorable than scary. Plus, I have to note that my game crashed three times in about seven hours of play.</p><p>That’s not to say the AI is trash altogether. Cold Iron says it’s already resolved some of the movement issues the xenomorphs were experiencing in the preview build, and it really is impressive to see dozens of inky black aliens bounding down the hallway, each on its own path but out for blood, and the game is built around these moments. The xenos stumble around corners like dogs on a tile floor, and details like this add much-needed personality to the waves.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a8e4f270-7ae8-11eb-b97f-c1ae18e3ae0b" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite" data-uuid="721e2881-005d-307a-9d13-35e488a4b2a8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">20th Century Studios</div></figure><p>The game’s most exciting moments come at the end of each mission, during the final swarm. These are long standoffs with waves of xenomorphs, including spitters, prowlers, bursters and giants that hunt down a single crew member at a time. I’ve found the technician and doc to be particularly useful in these moments — the technician has a turret that recharges after it’s been destroyed and shock grenades to keep the xenomorphs at bay, while the doc has an incredibly handy healing circle.</p><p>This is where the most strategizing takes place, even if it is mostly just turret talk. There are chests containing consumable weapons, health and on-demand ammo refills at each final battle, meaning your whole team will start off well-equipped and they’re free to spray and pray. This is good, considering the reticles on most of the weapons are generous, and crowd control is the name of the game, not accuracy.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/a8e4f271-7ae8-11eb-bf7f-d3069f06eed0" alt="Aliens: Fireteam Elite" data-uuid="bf2d1cc1-ba96-3faa-9f88-c9d2c8b897e2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">20th Century Studios</div></figure><p>There are a few bright spots in <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>. The soundtrack is a James Horner-inspired orchestral situation and it’s a constant reminder of the game’s cinematic 1980s roots; it does a lot of heavy lifting when it comes to setting the mood. Plus, the game’s RPG elements — including character, loadout and weapon customization, and challenge cards — add a necessary layer of depth to otherwise straightforward missions.</p><p>I wasn’t expecting <em>Fireteam Elite</em> to be as narrative-driven as the films or as moody as <em>Alien: Isolation</em>, but I had hoped for something like Left 4 Dead meets Dead Space, and this ain’t that. Instead, <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite </em>feels like a theme park ride in video game form. The monsters aren’t really threatening, but the crowds certainly are. And, of course, it’s more fun with friends.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/aliens-fireteam-elite-preview-video-140044958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">167c860f-e346-47e6-b9c0-279c72f315c6</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626858691</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T09:11:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d7a72d1-e9a6-11eb-b791-6b6592190957" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3d7ae800-e9a6-11eb-ac17-204554e61094" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[20th Century Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aliens: Fireteam Elite]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aliens: Fireteam Elite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to watch the Tokyo Olympics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p><p>After a year-long delay due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the games of the XXXII Olympiad are scheduled to begin in Tokyo this week.

The sheer amount of action happening every day through the first week of August means you’ll need to plan ahead to catch all of the events you want to see, especially if you’re on the opposite side of the world.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>When do the Olympics start?</strong></h2><p>The official start to the Olympics is the opening ceremony on Friday, July 23rd at 7AM ET, but a few events will actually kick off before that. Softball and Women’s Soccer competition begins Wednesday (Tokyo time), but the first games aired Tuesday night on the east coast. Softball, Men’s Soccer and Rowing are set to take place on Thursday with Rowing, Cycling, Tennis and Women’s Water Polo scheduled after the Opening Ceremony Friday and into Saturday. This weekend is when things really get going though, with a packed slate of events from Saturday onward. The closing ceremony will air at 8PM ET on NBC on Sunday, August 8th.</p><h2><strong>How to watch</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/726fb050-e9a5-11eb-8bad-72b3410bdb23" style="height:2534;width:3801;" alt="Jul 5, 2021; East Hartford, Connecticut, USA; The United States midfielder Sam Mewis (3) in action defended against Mexico midfielder Nancy Antonio (16) during the first half during a USWNT Send-off Series soccer match at Pratt &amp; Whitney Stadium.

The network’s current deal goes through 2032, so you won’t have to look around to find the games on new channels anytime soon. Due to the volume of events, NBC proper isn’t enough to show all of the action, so you can also find live coverage on NBCSN, USA, CNBC, Golf Channel and the Olympic Channel — cable or TV streaming subscription required. Following controversy over tape delays during previous Olympics, NBC began airing events live in 2012 despite the massive time differences. During prime time in the US, the network will show highlights from earlier in the day in addition to any live action.</p><p>At least a portion of the marquee events — including the opening/closing ceremonies, Women’s Soccer Final, Basketball, Track &amp; Field — will air on NBC. A lot of the events that take place in the middle of the night Eastern time (which is the bulk of the action) will be shown on the other networks and <a href="https://fave.co/3cesCla"><ins>NBC’s streaming service Peacock</ins></a>. NBC Sports announced that Peacock will be home to “major events live each morning” including Women’s and Men’s Gymnastics, Track &amp; Field and Basketball. The streaming service will also have six themed channels alongside three highlight shows throughout the day Eastern time along with a spotlight series that focuses on the women of Team USA. Olympics coverage will be available for free on Peacock with the exception of Men’s Basketball. You’ll need a $4.99 subscription to watch those games.</p><p>If you’d rather watch from your computer, phone or tablet, NBC says “every single event” will be available through NBCOlympics.com and the NBC Sports app. Twitch will also serve up Olympics content, but not live events. There, you’ll find interviews, highlights and, of course, competitions. The platform will also host streams and co-streams with Twitch creators during some of the primetime broadcasts.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b709f1d0-e9a5-11eb-b6af-6f73c4de0fea" style="height:3648;width:5472;" alt="Tokyo 2020 Olympics - Table Tennis Training - Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium, Tokyo, Japan - July 20, 2021 General view of athletes during training REUTERS/Thomas Peter" data-uuid="89bcdda6-898a-3b07-a46a-098fc9f8abde"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Thomas Peter / reuters</div></figure><p>Several services and TV providers offer tools to help you keep up with all of the action. YouTube TV, for example, allows you to select which events you’re interested in and the app will automatically record them to its cloud DVR. Here’s to watching Swimming at a normal hour and not staying up until 2AM. YouTube TV has also added a medal table for quick reference and its “Jump To” feature lets you hop around events and specific moments easily. Cable providers <a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-olympic-games-xfinity-customers-x1-flex-and-stream"><ins>like Comcast</ins></a> (owned by NBC’s parent company) are offering Olympics hubs on their services for easy access. There’s a degree of personalization across Xfinity tiers, for example, as well as notifications about “must-see moments” and playlists of highlights.</p><p>For a full schedule, <a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/schedule"><ins>visit NBCOlympics.com</ins></a> to find info on all of the events you’re looking for.</p><p>Fans in the UK don’t have to contend with quite the time difference as those of us in the States, but they’ll still get to watch as much of the action as they want. The BBC is the official broadcaster in the UK and it’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/sport/olympics/57597043"><ins>promising over 350 hours of coverage</ins></a> through early August. BBC One and BBC Two will show live events while an additional livestream will be available on BBC iPlayer. The network will have daily highlights and recap shows in both the morning and evening with anything that airs on BBC One or Two available on-demand via iPlayer. Coverage is also available through BBC Radio 5 Live and The Olympics Daily podcast.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-watch-the-tokyo-olympics-134504180.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1e13f8e2-e5ed-40a8-ba39-6b81126eaff0</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 13:45:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626874275</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T13:31:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Summer Olympics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Olympics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/65c97580-d43c-11eb-beff-966c1caa7050" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/65c97580-d43c-11eb-beff-966c1caa7050" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pawel Kopczynski / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A general view of the Olympic Rings installed on a floating platform with the Rainbow Bridge in the background in preparation for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan June 21, 2021.

Their big promise is powerful graphics performance, which isn&#39;t just limited to games. Video editing and 3D rendering programs can also tap into their GPUs to handle especially demanding tasks. While you can find decent GPUs on some productivity laptops, like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Dell&#39;s XPS 15" href="https://bit.ly/3A4C8Sb">Dell&#39;s XPS 15</a>, you can sometimes find better deals on gaming laptops. My general advice for any new workhorse machine: Get at least 16GB of RAM and the largest solid state drive you can find. Those components are both typically hard to upgrade down the line.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The one big downside to choosing a gaming notebook is portability. For the most part, we&#39;d recommend 15-inch models to get the best balance of size and price. Those typically weigh in around 4.5 pounds, which is a significantly more than three-pound ultraportables. Today&#39;s gaming notebooks are still far lighter than older models, though, so at least you won&#39;t be lugging around a 10-pound brick. Also, if you&#39;re not into LED lights and other gamer-centric bling, keep an eye out for more understated models (or make sure you know how to turn those lights off).</p><h2>Best midrange for most people: ASUS Zephyrus G15</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6c703fb0-ea24-11eb-af5f-663ae06b840e" alt="Back to School - ASUS Zephyrus G15" data-uuid="f5191389-e401-3595-b1a4-f299ff8055c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography / ASUS</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Zephryus G15" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Vy4P0E">Zephryus G15</a> has all the power you&#39;d want in a gaming laptop, at a price that&#39;s more reasonable than higher-end options. It&#39;s a slightly larger follow-up to last year&#39;s favorite for this category (the G14), but there&#39;s still lots to love. The G15 features AMD&#39;s latest Ryzen 5000 processors, along with NVIDIA&#39;s RTX 3000 GPUs. And, judging from our benchmarks, it manages to make good use of all that power. It also has a fast 165Hz 1440p screen, which is ideal for playing games at high framerates. The G15 doesn&#39;t have a webcam, but its solid specs and performance more than make up for that.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Buy Zephyrus G15 at Best Buy - $1,850" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/Vy4P0E">Buy Zephyrus G15 at Best Buy - $1,850</a></p><h2>Best high-end option: Razer Blade 15</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92070d30-ea24-11eb-b79f-af7fe937acf3" alt="Back to School - Razer Blade 15" data-uuid="1c239297-3262-3911-9719-4537d22f412e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>For years, Razer has staked a reputation for building gaming laptops that look as good as MacBooks.

That opens up a near desktop-level of multitasking, since you can have windows spread across both screens. That could be useful for browsing the web and keeping an eye on Twitter at the same time.

Today, the companies <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/07/21/argo-ai-ford-lyft-network.html">announced</a> that Ford&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-10-ford-argo-ai-self-driving.html">Argo AI</a>-powered cars will be available on Lyft&#39;s network later this year in Miami, followed by Austin in 2022. The move will allow passengers to choose a Ford self-driving vehicle with a safety driver in those regions when they book their ride from the app. By 2026, Ford plans to add 1,000 of its driverless vehicles to Lyft&#39;s fleet in multiple markets, a pact that the companies are in the process of finalizing.</p><p>The deployment should provide a shot in the arm for Lyft&#39;s autonomous ride-hailing ambitions.

The decision reflected wider concerns within the industry over the revenue-bleeding nature of autonomous driving. In December, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-atg-sale-aurora-221855364.html">Uber</a> decided to sell its self-driving unit to startup Aurora as a belt-tightening maneuver.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fortunately for Lyft, it&#39;s had close ties with Ford — which is aggressively pursuing its own self-driving goals —since 2017. The partnership between the two companies was forged on the back of Ford&#39;s $1 billion investment in autonomous vehicle startup Argo AI. Since then, the automaker has been testing its driverless vehicle service in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-27-ford-will-test-self-driving-car-service-in-miami.html">Miami</a>, Austin and Washington, D.C.</p><p>“Argo and Ford are currently piloting, mapping and preparing for commercial operations of autonomous vehicles in more cities than any other [autonomous vehicle] collaboration, and this new agreement is a crucial step toward full commercial operations – the addition of Lyft’s world-class transportation network,” said Scott Griffith, CEO, Ford Autonomous Vehicles &amp; Mobility Businesses.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-self-driving-lyft-miami-123529662.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5435d52e-2dac-49d4-ab0f-59e4943101f2</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 12:35:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626870843</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T12:34:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/47130780-ea1e-11eb-975f-19c559780bd9" width="6410" height="4274" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/47130780-ea1e-11eb-975f-19c559780bd9" width="6410" height="4274" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Argo AI, Lyft and Ford]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Argo AI, Lyft and Ford]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['The Last Video Store' is a Blockbuster-inspired game coming to PSVR]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>People are weirdly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-last-blockbuster-in-australia-closing.html">fascinated</a> with Blockbuster, even though (or perhaps because) there&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blockbuster-airbnb-90s-sleepover-nostalgia-september-205924817.html">only one</a> remaining store in the entire world.

To stand out from its bigger rival, the soccer franchise is adopting a new name, <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/eu/en/topics/15974/"><em>eFootball</em></a><em>,</em> and going free-to-play on consoles, PC and mobile.&nbsp;</p><p>Clearly, this isn&#39;t a one-off. Konami has rebuilt the game using Unreal engine as part of the shift to providing a digital service. The biggest change to gameplay is the new &quot;motion matching&quot; technology designed to make player animations more realistic. Gamers will choose from different movements in real-time during matches. Seeing as the original Pro Evo&#39;s gameplay is what helped to distinguish it from FIFA, motion matching could prove a make or break feature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8b20117749394526b10d12d2bd9b615d"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jzd7OpCHCi0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>As you&#39;d expect from an F2P title, <em>eFootball </em>will regularly receive new updates after its launch this fall. Konami will have to tread with care, however. Free-to-play games have attracted the ire of players and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-12-uk-government-loot-boxes-regulation.html">regulators</a> alike due to their exploitative nature, best summed up by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-17-loot-boxes-illegal-gambling-regulators-europe-us.html">loot boxes</a> that cost real money to obtain. The last thing the storied developer wants is to sully Pro Evo&#39;s name. Maybe, that&#39;s why it&#39;s changing it.&nbsp;</p><p>But, the news will probably raise alarm bells for fans. Konami said that only &quot;local matches&quot; featuring FC Barcelona, Juventus, FC Bayern, Manchester United &quot;and others&quot; will be available for free at launch. While, certain game modes will later be sold as optional DLC, &quot;giving players the freedom to build an experience&quot; that matches their interests. It&#39;s a major risk that Konami is banking on to restore the franchise as a regular feature in dorms and living rooms around the world.&nbsp;</p><p>The game will land in early fall with cross-generation matchmaking between current and last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles. Later in the fall, you can expect a managerial-style team building mode, online leagues, and a match pass system that rewards you with items and players. At the same time, cross-platform play will be introduced between consoles and PC. The winter will see the release of mobile controller support, full cross-play including mobile and the launch of professional and amateur eSports tournaments.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pro-evolution-soccer-efootball-104633019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c41fd85-e2a8-43d7-a354-8c4e23f6b04b</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:46:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626864397</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T10:47:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/08b7e2d0-ea0f-11eb-afbf-3e77b8e14559" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/08b7e2d0-ea0f-11eb-afbf-3e77b8e14559" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Konami]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Konami]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Konami]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Study suggests EVs really are cleaner than gas-powered cars over their lifespan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The lifetime emissions of an electric car versus a gasoline vehicle has become an intensely debated topic for governments. A new <a href="https://theicct.org/publications/global-LCA-passenger-cars-jul2021">study</a> that compares the climate impact of passenger cars could play a pivotal role in the argument. The report claims that electric cars produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions &quot;from the cradle to the grave&quot; than their gas-guzzling counterparts. According to the study, the core result is the same globally, even when applied to countries like China and India, where the majority of the electricity to recharge an EV comes from coal.</p><p>The findings are a rebuke for voices in the automotive and oil lobbying industries that still claim that electric cars are no cleaner than gas-powered vehicles. It arrives as governments are trying to cement their environmental policies in line with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-15-countries-reach-deal-to-implement-paris-climate-change-agreement.html">Paris Agreement</a>. Finalized in 2015, the climate change accord saw 143 countries, including the US, agree to limit global temperature increases to less than 2 degrees Celsius. To help meet that target, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/washington-state-gas-car-sales-ban-2030-175652987.html">Washington</a> state and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-to-ban-sale-of-new-gaspowered-cars-by-2035-180313529.html">California</a> have proposed banning the sale of new gasoline cars from 2030 and 2035, respectively.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The study conducted by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) examined the entire life-cycles of EVs and gasoline cars, from extracting raw materials to production to their eventual disposal. Researchers examined the greenhouse gas emissions from the vehicle and fuel types in four territories that together account for 70 percent of new car sales worldwide: the US, the EU, China and India.</p><p>For cars registered in 2021, the report found that lifetime emissions for a medium-sized EV in Europe are between 66 and 69 percent lower compared to that of a gasoline vehicle in the same category. In the US, an EV produces between 60 to 68 percent fewer emissions. In China, an EV results in between 37 to 45 percent fewer emissions. In India, it’s between 19 to 34 percent lower.</p><p>By 2030, the gap between EVs and gas-guzzlers is tipped to increase to 74 percent to 77 percent in Europe, 62 percent to 76 percent in the US, 48 percent to 64 percent in China, and 30 percent to 56 percent in India.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the researchers assume that a vehicle will be on the road for around 18 years. They also state that the gap between the figures reflects the uncertainty around how the energy mix in each region develops, which itself is tied to future policies.</p><p>“One important result of the analysis is to show that life-cycle emissions trends are similar in all four regions, despite the differences among them in vehicle mix, grid mix, and so on. Already for cars registered today, [battery electric vehicles] have better relative [greenhouse gas] emissions performance everywhere than conventional vehicles,” said ICCT deputy director Rachel Muncrief.</p><p>There are still caveats, however.

One of the most useful changes to Maps is the expansion of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-google-maps-public-transit-crowdedness-predictions-delays.html">transit crowdedness predictions</a> to over 10,000 cities in 100 countries.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies are expecting their staff to get back to the office in the near future, and crowdedness prediction can let you know if the train or bus line you&#39;re waiting for has a lot of open seats, or if it&#39;s already crowded. That way, you can decide whether to hop on or wait for the next one in hopes that it isn&#39;t as jam-packed.  Maps can make predictions by combining AI tech with contributions from people using Google Maps, along with historical location trends.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/de222960-ea0c-11eb-975f-6e028f97245a" style="height:897;width:1200;" alt="Google Maps" data-uuid="9fbfc329-04e6-3f2e-9303-596db5bbcac9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>If you&#39;re in New York and Sydney, you can even see a train&#39;s level of crowdedness down to transit car level in real time. Maps will mark the least crowded cars, so you can line up for one of them, thanks to data from transport agencies in the areas. It&#39;s still a pilot at the moment, but Google says the feature will be available in more cities soon.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the tech giant has launched a new Timeline Insights tab for the Maps app. So long as you&#39;re on Android and you have Location History switched on, you&#39;ll be able to view &quot;monthly trends about how you’re navigating the world.&quot; For instance, that&#39;s where you can see how much time you spend at different places, such as shops or airports, and the distance and time for each mode of transportation you&#39;ve taken. The tech giant says it developed the feature after users told the company that they want &quot;to be more intentional about how they spend their time&quot; after living through the pandemic.</p><p>Finally, Trips in the Timeline tab is now available to everyone on Android, so you can relive the vacations you&#39;ve had in the past. In case your favorite travel destination still isn&#39;t welcoming tourists, you can go to the section and virtually visit hotels, restaurants and other places you&#39;ve previously enjoyed.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-maps-features-post-lockdown-life-100004041.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97dd6b88-ba3f-4e2c-b617-0ff883a58244</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 10:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626862681</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T10:18:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/7c707a70-6914-11ea-bbc2-8ad1adea04d7" width="5311" height="3541" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-03/7c707a70-6914-11ea-bbc2-8ad1adea04d7" width="5311" height="3541" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Halfpoint Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman commuter using public transport in summer.

The hardware HW 3.0 update will now cost $1,000 rather than $1,500, a 33 percent drop in price. To get the feature, owners will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-subscription-price-availability-151630041.html">have to pay</a> a monthly subscription fee of up to $199 on top of that, or $10,000 all in one shot.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla <a href="https://www.tesla.com/blog/all-tesla-cars-being-produced-now-have-full-self-driving-hardware">famously said</a> in 2016 that all its EVs produced going forward would have full self-driving hardware. However, it eventually found that a computer update would be needed on older vehicles and started shipping later models with the new HW 3.0 hardware. However, owners of Tesla models produced between late 2016 and mid-2019 were shocked to get hit with a $1,500 hardware upgrade bill on top of the cost of the FSD upgrade.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After telling customers they&#39;d be charged $1,500 for the hardware update, Tesla appears to have lowered that to $1,000. As before, you&#39;ll need to take your car to an authorized Tesla service center to get the update.&nbsp;</p><p>Much like the &quot;Autopilot,&quot; Tesla&#39;s FSD system does not offer full self-driving defined as Level 4 or beyond. Rather, it told California regulators that it conforms to SAE Level 2, much like models from Cadillac, Audi and others. Tesla CEO Elon Musk himself said that &quot;there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid.&quot;  <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-software-lacks-safeguards-a6698414036/"><em>Consumer Reports</em></a>, meanwhile, noted that it&#39;s &quot;concerned that Tesla is still using its existing owners and their vehicles to beta-test new features on public roads.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-reduces-the-price-of-its-full-self-driving-computer-upgrade-by-500-091157676.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc299a10-59da-4621-ac1f-bd23b674272c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 09:11:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626858719</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T09:12:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f3f33d0-e9fa-11eb-bff7-1a51b889584d" width="1400" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f3f33d0-e9fa-11eb-bff7-1a51b889584d" width="1400" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla reduces the price of its 'Full Self-Driving' computer upgrade by $500]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla reduces the price of its 'Full Self-Driving' computer upgrade by $500]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tokyo Olympics staff will be given ear-worn devices to reduce the risk of heatstroke]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Summers in Tokyo are not only hot, they&#39;re also extremely humid — together, those two elements are a recipe for heat-related illness. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/jul/20/tokyo-olympics-fears-athletes-could-face-hottest-games-on-record"><em>The Guardian</em></a>, there are concerns that the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-24-tokyo-olympics-postponed-summer-2021.html">Tokyo Olympics</a> would lead to a rise in heatstroke cases, which is definitely a huge issue when medical services are already stretched too thin due to the pandemic. To help protect Olympics&#39; staff from heat-related illnesses, Alibaba has designed a cloud-based solution to monitor their body temperature and heart rate.&nbsp;</p><p>The Olympics staff will wear an intelligent device in their ear to track their stats and the environment index, which will be monitored through heat stress meters set up across the venues. That data will then be sent to a cloud-based technology that will identify the level of heatstroke risk in real time for each user. Those who are highly at risk of getting a heatstroke will receive alerts on their phones, along with recommended precautionary measures, such as drinking more water as soon as possible.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In 2020, Tokyo <a href="https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/13693478">reported</a> almost 200 heat-related deaths in the metropolis, so athletes and staff members are bracing for what could be the hottest Olympics yet. The city can be so hot and humid in the summer, officials had to move the 1964 games to October. Since that&#39;s not going to happen this time around — the event will begin on July 23rd — precautionary measures like using Alibaba&#39;s anti-heatstroke tech must be taken.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tokyo-olympics-staff-alibaba-anti-heatstroke-074018858.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">db3ebe8c-748b-48da-a879-0800fc9008e2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 07:40:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626858000</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T09:00:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2ac2c2e0-e9ed-11eb-bffb-46b49f970668" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2ac2c2e0-e9ed-11eb-bffb-46b49f970668" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alibaba Group]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mobile app with level of heatstroke risk]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Alibaba]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Elon Musk says Tesla will open its Superchargers to other EVs this year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Owners of non-Tesla EVs may be able to use some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-19-tesla-supercharger-network-for-all.html">Superchargers</a> by the end of 2021.

That&#39;s become a more likely possibility now, after the company brought Pen support to its Galaxy S21 flagships this year.

Starting today, you can watch the pilot episodes of select series, including <em>Game of Throne</em>s, <em>Lovecraft Country</em> and <em>Gossip Girl</em>, <a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-brings-free-episodes-snapchat-new-app-co-viewing-experience">on Snapchat</a> and do so while chatting with up to 63 other people.</p><p>The ability to watch HBO Max content through Snapchat comes courtesy of the Minis functionality <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-mini-apps-174530579.html">Snap introduced last June</a>. The tool allows third-party developers to offer pared-down versions of their apps within Snapchat. So far, some of the more popular developers to offer Minis include Headspace, but HBO Max is the first major streamer to use the feature to let people view its content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can start the HBO Max Mini by tapping on the rocket icon in chat or using the search feature to find it. Before you can see a list of available episodes, the app will ask you to verify your age. You don&#39;t need an HBO Max subscription to watch any of the pilots, but the Mini will prompt users over the age of 18 to sign up for the service. Once a session is underway, up to 63 other people can join one, and you can chat with everyone else watching the episode and share Bitmoji reactions.</p><p>HBO Max isn&#39;t the first streaming service to use another platform to attract users. Before its all too predictable death, Quibi let people watch pilots of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/quibi-originals-available-youtube-173238029.html">originals on YouTube</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-hbo-max-mini-223803217.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8d9c43a9-a7a3-49ee-ac40-f272baf9a7d8</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 22:38:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626819500</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T22:18:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2e764d40-e9a6-11eb-9b8f-bc9ad81e6fca" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2e764d40-e9a6-11eb-9b8f-bc9ad81e6fca" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[WarnerMedia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HBO Max Mini]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HBO Max Mini]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube’s Super Thanks tipping feature rolls out to more beta users]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For years, YouTube streamers have used third-party plugins to allow their fans to donate to them. Starting this week, however, YouTube is taking a step toward making that functionality something that’s built into the platform. While it’s still in beta, the company says its new “Super Thanks” feature is <a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/introducing-newest-member-supers-family-super-thanks/">rolling out to “thousands” of additional creators in 68 countries</a>. By the end of the year, it plans to make it available to everyone in the YouTube Partner Program.</p><p>When you decide to give your favorite creator a Super Thanks, you’ll have four options before you. The amounts will vary by market, but in the US you can donate $2, $5, $10 or $50 at one time. Once you complete the payment process, you’ll see an animated GIF of balloons float across your screen, and YouTube will highlight your comment, as well as the amount of money you sent. As with the other monetization tools YouTube offers to streamers, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-12-youtube-super-chat-comments-are-a-new-way-to-support-livestrea.html"><ins>Super Chat</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-05-youtube-animated-stickers-streamers-twitch-mixer.html"><ins>Super Stickers</ins></a>, the company will take a 30 percent cut of all donations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Adding more ways for creators to earn money is important for YouTube, even if it’s one the company is late to offer. Long gone are the days where it&#39;s the only video platform of note. The company faces competition from Twitch, TikTok and others, particularly as those platforms <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-creator-fund-183231670.html"><ins>look for ways</ins></a> to keep their most prolific creators invested in making content only for their respective apps.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-super-thanks-213222316.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">489087fd-62b9-4bc4-9cc3-001ec97c7f6b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 21:32:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626813815</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T20:43:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c15954d0-e998-11eb-a7eb-67aebffb3cc2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c15954d0-e998-11eb-a7eb-67aebffb3cc2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[YouTube]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YouTube Super Thanks]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[YouTube Super Thanks]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix says its gaming push will begin with mobile]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A report last week hinted at some of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-video-games-expansion-045850254.html">Netflix&#39;s gaming ambitions</a>. In <a href="https://ir.netflix.net/financials/quarterly-earnings/default.aspx">its Q2 2021 earnings report</a>, the company confirmed some things. First, Netflix says it &quot;will be primarily focused&quot; on mobile at first, looking to expand on its interactivity projects like <em>Black Mirror Bandersnatch </em>and its Stranger Things games. The upcoming titles will be available at no additional cost as part of your subscription and the company was clear it will keep up the pace on movies and television.</p><p>&quot;We view gaming as another new content category for us, similar to our expansion into original films, animation and unscripted TV,&quot; the company said in a letter to its shareholders.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>2020 was a big year for Netflix. With everyone stuck at home and movie theaters closed, the streaming service attracted <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2020-204146022.html">16 million new customers in three months</a>. As expected, in 2021 that pace has dramatically slowed and the new customer numbers continue to be a struggle. In its earnings report, the company says it added 1.5 million subscribers in Q2, which was actually a bit better than its forecast mark of one million. However, that&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q1-2021-201731732.html">lower than Q1 2021</a>, which saw the company tack on 3.98 million new customers globally.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix says it forecasts new customer additions to hit 3.5 million in Q3 2021, up from 2.2 million during the same three-month a year ago. If it does so, the company explains that would bring the total new subscriber tally to 54 million over the last two years. The pace may have slowed for Netflix, but overall it&#39;s doing just fine. Revenue was still up 19 percent year-over-year at $7.3 billion for the quarter.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Netflix&#39;s own numbers, <em>Shadow and Bone </em>was a popular series this quarter, streaming to over 55 million &quot;member households&quot; in less than a month. The show has already been renewed for a second season based on those numbers. <em>Sweet Tooth, </em>a series based on a DC comic, was streamed by 60 million households the first month it was available. Unscripted series like <em>Too Hot to Handle </em>and <em>The Circle </em>were popular selections as well, as was true crime docuseries <em>The Sons of Sam. </em>In terms of movies, Zac Snyder&#39;s <em>Army of the Dead </em>hit 75 million households in the first month. Netflix also explained that <em>The Mitchells vs. The Machines </em>is now its biggest animated film to date, streaming to 53 million households.&nbsp;</p><p>Netflix says COVID-related production delays led to a &quot;lighter&quot; first half of 2021 in terms of content, but the pace will pick up throughout the rest of the year. The company&#39;s Q3 lineup includes new seasons of <em>La Casa de Papel</em> (<em>Money Heist</em>), <em>Sex Education</em>, <em>Virgin River</em> and <em>Never Have I Ever</em> in addition to live action films like <em>Sweet Girl</em> (Jason Momoa), <em>Kissing Booth 3 </em>and <em>Kate</em> (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Plus, there&#39;s the animated film <em>Vivo</em>, which will feature new music from Lin-Manuel Miranda.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-q2-2021-earnings-204531144.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8db2f676-b5cb-4171-aaa0-9c979f32642a</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 20:45:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626845857</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T05:38:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/081a1ca0-e995-11eb-b57f-ad1c34547a82" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/081a1ca0-e995-11eb-b57f-ad1c34547a82" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jeff Bezos swung by space and has some thoughts]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Jeffrey Preston Bezos, a 57-year-old dad from New Mexico, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-completes-first-crewed-spaceflight-132937714.html">flew to the edge of space</a> and back again today. He wasn&#39;t the only person aboard the rocket, which was the first-ever crewed flight from private space company Blue Origin, but he&#39;s the one that camera crews flocked to once the 10-minute trip was done. Maybe they were drawn in by his smile. Maybe they thought he was the winner of a sub-orbital Lex Luthor lookalike contest. Maybe his bulbous, pale cowboy hat caught their eye.&nbsp;</p><p>In reality, of course, it was because Bezos is the founder of Blue Origin and Amazon, and considered to be the richest person in the world. This wealth not only gives him the opportunity to build, run and then ride his own rocket ships, but it also makes people really interested in what he has to say, regardless of his relationship to the matter at hand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When Bezos stepped back onto Earth after spinning around in zero-gravity for a few minutes, the cameras descended and his cowboy hat answered a handful of questions about the experience. The world&#39;s richest man shared his thoughts about space, pollution and wage depression, likely just before taking an SUV caravan to his private jet and heading to one of his global luxury estates.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are three of the most centibillionaire things Bezos said <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/jeff-bezos-says-spaceflight-reinforced-commitment-solving-climate-chan-rcna1467">after his Blue Origin flight</a> today:</p><p><strong>“We need to take all heavy industry, all polluting industry, and move it into space. And keep Earth as this beautiful gem of a planet that it is.”</strong> In this same interview, Bezos discussed his plans to expand Blue Origin&#39;s space tourism business over the coming decades, a venture that has the potential to pump <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2021/jul/19/billionaires-space-tourism-environment-emissions">massive amounts of carbon and other chemicals</a> into the atmosphere. Unlike ground-based emitters like cars or coal-powered plants, rocket emissions are expelled directly into the upper atmosphere, where they linger for years. Additionally, Amazon has threatened <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-amazon-employees-protest-climate-communications-policies.html">to fire employees</a> for speaking up about the company&#39;s support of the oil and gas industries.</p><p><strong>&quot;We need unifiers, not vilifiers. When you look out at the planet, there are no borders. There&#39;s nothing. It&#39;s one planet and we share it and it&#39;s fragile.&quot;</strong> As the CEO of Amazon, for years Bezos fought against company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-vote-154741754.html">efforts to unionize</a>, even amid credible reports of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-200-million-prime-subscribers-165713430.html">inhumane, exploitative conditions</a> for Amazon delivery drivers and warehouse workers.&nbsp;</p><div id="8fdead6a8e424ddaa7586aadb74bb974"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">.<a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JeffBezos</a> speaking truth after successful <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlueOrigin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlueOrigin</a> flight: <br><br>“I also want to thank every Amazon employee and every Amazon customer because you guys paid for all of this.” <a href="https://t.co/hMS01eRzMs">https://t.co/hMS01eRzMs</a><a href="https://t.co/3CueAOX9M8">pic.twitter.com/3CueAOX9M8</a></p>— Dan Linden (@DanLinden) <a href="https://twitter.com/DanLinden/status/1417513266050445312?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Bezos, who amassed more than $70 billion in personal wealth last year and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax">regularly pays $0 in federal income taxes</a>, then thanked those same Amazon employees for paying for his trip to space.

As of this week, the game supports up to 18,000 simultaneous logins in that region — up to 750 players per world server. The European data centers are in line for a similar upgrade soon.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yoshida noted the global semiconductor shortage has slowed delivery of servers to some data centers. Travel restrictions related to COVID-19 have prevented the server infrastructure team from visiting data centers too.</p><p>It&#39;s fascinating to see a game that&#39;s been around for eight years have such a massive, sudden increase in popularity, four months out from the next expansion. Still, it once again highlights the impact that streamers have on gaming culture.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-final-fantasy-xiv-servers-plan-193317600.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b7111623-d43e-40ff-b1b6-fa5cb106a36e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 19:33:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626809860</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T19:37:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/5b373080-9cfb-11eb-bf78-3fd9ae35c8c0" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/5b373080-9cfb-11eb-bf78-3fd9ae35c8c0" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dropbox makes automatic camera uploads available to all free users]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dropbox is introducing a variety of <a href="https://blog.dropbox.com/topics/product/new-features-to-keep-you-organized-at-work-and-home"><ins>new features across its product stack</ins></a>. Of all the tweaks the company announced today, the most intriguing ones involve its automatic backup utility for photos you take with your phone. Most notably, starting today that functionality is now available to all Basic users — that is, those who don&#39;t pay for the service.</p><p>The company says it has also made backend changes to make uploads faster and “more reliable.” Additionally, on iOS, you can specify the exact folders you want to back up. That functionality is coming soon to Android as well. Lastly, there’s a new option to tell Dropbox to delete a photo after it has uploaded it to the cloud. Notably, these features come after Google recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-photos-free-unlimited-storage-end-date-133058166.html"><ins>stopped offering unlimited free uploads to its Photos service</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e7c85f10-e986-11eb-9cff-c2828555fcec" style="height:1000;width:1600;" alt="Dropbox interface" data-uuid="528f6895-a43f-39cf-b5f4-a123fe0c1def"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dropbox</div></figure><p>In its web client, meanwhile, Dropbox is introducing several interface tweaks. The most significant of those changes is the addition of a new tool that allows you to convert files to different formats without leaving the client, with JPEGs to PNGs as one example. Elsewhere, Dropbox says a redesigned details pane makes it easier to see important information about your files. The company claims it has also made it faster to jump between different folders with a new side navigation bar.</p><p>As part of today’s update, Dropbox is also introducing a handful of new features to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dropbox-passwords-vault-130030637.html"><ins>password manager</ins></a>. Available to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dropbox-passwords-free-for-all-users-130012723.html"><ins>free users as of earlier this year</ins></a>, the tool can now store debit and credit card information. Dropbox has also added support for password sharing. Oh, and you can now download a free browser extension, making it easier to input and save passwords when you’re browsing the web on your computer. On their own, the changes Dropbox detailed today are small, but when you add them up, they make for a more compelling service.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dropbox-automatic-camera-uploads-free-users-183521936.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">928d03b5-67b2-408b-a3c3-f7d2f32c7524</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jul 2021 18:35:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626805645</ingested><modified>2021-07-20T18:27:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b597dc50-e986-11eb-9b76-a3fb69f6b928" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b597dc50-e986-11eb-9b76-a3fb69f6b928" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dropbox]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dropbox photo uploads]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dropbox photo uploads]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TweetDeck could soon look much more like Twitter’s web app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tweetdeck"><ins>TweetDeck</ins></a> is a secret weapon for Twitter power users.
