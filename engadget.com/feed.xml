Reporter Mark Gurman claims that the next model, which nobody is expecting to be called the iPhone 13 for obvious reasons, will also offer better filters for improving images after shooting.</p><p>Gurman’s sources also suggest that this phone will be more of an evolution compared to the revolution that was the iPhone 12. The design language, display sizes and model line up are likely to stay the same, with only the chip (A15) and screen technology changing. Gurman said that there will be a smaller notch for the FaceID cameras, and that the display will have a faster refresh rate.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some of this lines up with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-2021-always-on-display-223000663.html">leak from February</a>, when leaker Max Weinbach claimed that the new handset would get a low-power, 120Hz LTPO <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-12s-always-on-display-leak-164539339.html">always-on display</a>.

My favorite was <em>Gargoyles</em>. I have a special place in my heart for <em>TaleSpin</em>, but <em>DuckTales</em> was the undisputed king of the lineup. One hundred episodes and a movie with plenty of race cars, lasers, airplanes, robots, super suits, caveducks and, of course, Scrooge’s Lucky Number One Dime.</p><p>Plenty of cartoons from the ‘80s have seen reboots in the past decade, but few have failed to outshine the original or gain a real fandom. So when a <em>DuckTales</em> reboot was announced, I was admittedly a bit wary, though the cast announcement certainly was enough to get my jaded self at least a little excited, with David Tennant as Scrooge McDuck and Beck Bennett as Launchpad McQuack.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d075d6f106c449379cad76113ab9bf4d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zZek9PFMYOw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The show debuted in July 2017 and I have to say they nailed it. It straddled the line between giving fans all the little in-jokes and callbacks to the original show they loved, but also introducing new characters (like tech mogul Mark Beaks) and plotlines to make the show feel fresh and modern. Huey, Dewey and Louie were given different color-coded outfit designs, distinct personalities and separate character arcs. Mrs. Beakley was upgraded from Scrooge’s housekeeper to also being a former secret agent he used to work with. And Webby was aged up and made more adventurous, so she could hold her own on any journey and even make a few friends along the way.</p><p>The show’s biggest strength was how heavily it drew from its source material, not just the original series but the original Carl Barks comics that inspired it in the first place. <em>DuckTales</em> (2017) marks the first animated appearance of Huey, Dewey and Louie’s mother (and Donald’s sister) Della. She was also modernized, made into an adventuring pilot with a short temper, not unlike her brother’s. The show also referenced other Disney Afternoon shows like <em>TaleSpin</em>, <em>Chip ’N’ Dale’s Rescue Rangers</em> and <em>Goof Troop</em>. It was truly a love letter to fans, but one with a solid plot and some wicked humor that today’s kids could still enjoy.</p><div id="1589be216df64eb3b3b8ddc37fda0fca"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-XWCCzD7TTI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The show came to an end earlier this year, with the third season hitting <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/P0ab6Y">Disney+</a> back in March. While the first season dealt with Magica DeSpell and season two was all about the Moon, season three pit Clan McDuck against the evil agency F.O.W.L. The creators knew this would be the last season, so it also pulls double duty on tying up stray plotlines and checking off their bucket list. That included bringing back Darkwing Duck and setting up a possible spinoff show, telling us the story of how Scrooge met Donald and Della, and even giving us a pseudo-sequel to <em>TaleSpin</em>.</p><p>Family was also a constant theme in the last season, with the show delving into Della’s newfound parenthood as well as where Webby ultimately sits within the family. I didn’t quite cry during the finale, but I came close. One thing that kept me going in the end was the knowledge that the story would continue in some form, not just in comics but in a weekly podcast featuring all the original voice actors. Seven episodes of <a href="https://youtu.be/2cDUgXVUpks"><em>This Duckburg Life</em></a> are available (yes, it is a parody of Ira Glass), and a nice thing about the program is that it contains no spoilers for the cartoon so you can check it out even before you binge the show on Disney+. The episodes are fairly short, less than 15 minutes, which is fine because DuckTales has always been good at packing a lot of adventure into its 22-minute runtime.</p><div id="35a997b9f4d04be78621a0b8a4d2c527"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nOxxw8zu-sM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ducktales-2017-reboot-podcast-disney-plus-110100145.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d4812f19-9fde-4f7d-b045-a71c65429268</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 11:01:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628542213</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T20:50:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8ceff200-f94f-11eb-9fb3-78de7ce2f8bf" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8ceff200-f94f-11eb-9fb3-78de7ce2f8bf" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Disney]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DUCKTALES – “The Last Adventure!” – The future of adventuring hangs in the balance as the Duck family uncovers earth-shattering secrets in a final standoff with the Fiendish Organization for World Larceny (F.O.W.L.).

The VPN itself is baked into the Google One app, and the company says it will encrypt and protect you no matter what app you’re using. Plus, if you’re unsure how exactly to get connected, you can schedule a Pro Session for an expert to coach you through the basics.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, Google is reminding folks that the VPN has seen a number of feature upgrades since its launch, including the ability to block internet traffic when the VPN is inactive. You can also bypass the VPN in specific situations or with specific mobile apps, and set timed controls for when you need to be free from its protective embrace. Google added that the VPN has been independently audited and found to be robust enough for most folks to trust it.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-one-vpn-canada-mexico-europe-101525353.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6581eb5e-d017-44a5-83a3-473df32c4d54</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 10:15:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628590132</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T10:09:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/80c1faa0-f9c2-11eb-bfd6-604f36316b0a" width="1000" height="409" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/80c1faa0-f9c2-11eb-bfd6-604f36316b0a" width="1000" height="409" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google’s One Plan VPN is now available outside the US]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google simplifies its Titan security key lineup]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has <a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2021/08/simplifying-titan-security-key-options.html">announced</a> that it is retiring the Bluetooth version of its Titan <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ios-security-keys-advanced-protection-program-170914589.html">security key</a> in order to streamline its security product line. The search giant will now only offer two editions; one with USB-A and USB-C, both of which will pack NFC to enable it to be used by most mobile devices.

Starting September 1st, you&#39;ll be able to contact Amazon directly with a property damage or personal injury claim, and then Amazon will connect you with the seller.

The entry-level package includes access to four classes every 30 days. If you already pay for an in-studio membership, you can buy a $20 add-on that gives you access to the app&#39;s on-demand content.

I could not do both.&quot;</p><blockquote><p>DC had presented me with a three-year renewal of my exclusive contract, with the intent of me working on Batman for the bulk of that time. I was grateful of the offer, but I couldn’t help but look at the success of my original, creator owned titles and wonder if it was the right choice.</p></blockquote><p>Substack first got into comics back in June when it signed Marvel&#39;s <em>Amazing Spider-Man</em> writer Nick Spencer. Spencer reportedly spearheaded the idea and was the liaison between Substack and newly signed creators. On top of comic book stories, they&#39;ll publish, essays, how-to guides and other content on the platform.</p><p>Until recently, Substack has mostly focused on newsletters covering politics, technology and more. Comics, meanwhile, have been around forever on the web, but have largely been funded by ads and merchandise sales. By joining with Substack, creators will be able to engage directly with readers in a model that more closely resembles comic book sales.&nbsp;</p><p>In his Substack <a href="https://jamestynioniv.substack.com/p/a-whole-new-era">launch post</a>, Tynion said that he effectively turned down a three-year renewal of his DC Batman contract when Substack signed him &quot;to create a new slate of original comic book properties directly on their platform, that my co-creators and I would own completely,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I’m going to dedicate my whole brain to building a bunch of really cool stuff on my own terms, without having to get permission from any publisher to make it.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/substack-signs-a-slate-of-big-name-comics-creators-042310705.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8c2076b1-2951-485b-bed3-36bb179b84a8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 04:23:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628569389</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T04:23:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Visual Arts]]></category><category><![CDATA[Books & Publishing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Humanities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ef8e670-f98d-11eb-b7fd-6a26f1e6ec6a" width="1523" height="989" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0ef8e670-f98d-11eb-b7fd-6a26f1e6ec6a" width="1523" height="989" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Michael Avon Oeming]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Substack signs a slate of big-name comics creators]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Substack signs a slate of big-name comics creators]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Parallels 17 promises better M1 Mac performance and Windows 11 support]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Parallels, the company best know for its virtualization software that lets you run Windows and Linux directly on your Mac, has had a busy year. In addition to building a version of Parallels that can <a href="https://www.engadget.com/parallels-chromebook-running-windows-10-170015389.html">run on Chrome OS</a> for the first time, the company also had to figure out how to quickly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/parallels-desktop-m1-mac-native-virtual-machine-144526933.html">make its software work with the new, ARM-based M1 Macs</a> that arrived last fall. Now, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Parallels Desktop 17" href="https://fave.co/3As1rgi">Parallels Desktop 17</a> is being released with improved performance on M1 Macs, as well as full support for the upcoming macOS Monterey and Windows 11 operating systems.&nbsp;</p><p>Before getting into these improvements, though, it&#39;s worth taking a moment to talk compatibility. Apple moving the Mac to ARM architecture means there are now two classes of Macs for Parallels to support. As of today, the only versions of Windows that Parallels can run on an M1 Mac are the Insider Previews for Windows 10 and Windows 11 — because those versions of the OS are able to run on ARM-based hardware. But, Parallels unequivocally says that when the full version of Windows 11 is released to the public, it&#39;ll run on Parallels 17.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On an Intel-baed Mac, however, users can still run a host of virtual machines, including Windows support all the way back to XP and Windows 2000, and macOS all the way back to 2011&#39;s OS X Lion. It can also run eight different Linux distros; M1 Macs can only virtualize four right now, including Ubuntu and Fedora.</p><p>So while Intel Macs still offer the broadest compatibility, Parallels has found that the raw power of the M1 chip means users likely aren&#39;t giving anything up running the Windows 10 or 11 Insider Previews. Microsoft&#39;s built-in emulation for Windows means that Windows 10 Insider Preview can run almost any 32-bit x86 app as well as &quot;many&quot; 64-bit x86 apps, and the M1&#39;s power helps to make up for speed lost due to emulation.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what&#39;s new, Parallels has speed improvements across the board, whether you&#39;re running Intel or M1. Regardless of which system you&#39;re using, Parallels 17 resumes Windows and Linux up to 38 percent faster, while OpenGL graphics run up to six times faster than the previous version. M1-specific speed improvements include 20 percent faster disk performance when using Windows 10 Insider preview, while DirectX graphics should perform up to 28 percent better. These tests are all run by Parallels, and we can&#39;t verify them yet, but improving performance has long been a focus for the company.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a handful of new features on board, as well. Parallels improved its &quot;Coherence&quot; mode, where you can run a Windows app without launching into the full Windows UI. Now, things like shutdowns, updates and sign-in screens are windowed as well, making them easier to pop into the background. The ability to drag and drop between Windows and Mac apps has been improved, as well — for example, you can now highlight and drop text and images between Mac and Windows apps, and it&#39;ll work with the new Quick Note feature coming to macOS Monterey.&nbsp;</p><p>Parallels 17 also contains a virtual TPM (Trusted Platform Module) chip, which lets the system use BitLocker and Secure Boot when running Windows 10 and Windows 11. There&#39;s an added layer of intrigue to this feature: Microsoft originally said that a computer with a TPM chip was a requirement for Windows 11 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-preview-system-requirements-202709366.html">before backtracking</a> (at least for the testing period). It&#39;s not clear yet if the final version of Windows 11 will require a TPM chip, but this virtualization should let Parallels users get around this requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>As with most software these days, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Parallels Desktop 17" href="https://fave.co/3As1rgi">Parallels Desktop 17</a> is being sold as a subscription. The standard edition is $79.99 per year, and the pro edition costs $99.99 per year. If you&#39;re on a subscription, you&#39;ll get Parallels updates as long as the subscription is active. If you prefer, though, you can get a perpetual license of the standard edition Parallels 17 for $99.99; people who have purchased a past perpetual license can upgrade for $49.99.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/parallels-desktop-17-m-1-mac-performance-windows-11-support-040128211.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e066b1b9-9226-4a38-910b-a12c18d77ac1</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 04:01:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628597681</ingested><modified>2021-08-10T12:15:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3096b90-f924-11eb-bdbd-02bc513d6b45" width="4000" height="2400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3096b90-f924-11eb-bdbd-02bc513d6b45" width="4000" height="2400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Parallels]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop 17]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Parallels Desktop 17]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony closes $1.175 billion deal to buy Crunchyroll from AT&T]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;s official.

In newly unsealed court documents, the two companies say the fraudsters made knockoffs of some of GoPro&#39;s most popular accessories that blatantly used its branding to try and trick potential buyers.</p><p>Among the products the counterfeiters saw to pass off as authentic include GoPro&#39;s signature &quot;3-Way&quot; and &quot;The Handler&quot; grips. The knockoffs were often hard to spot, with subtle differences between them and their real GoPro counterparts. For instance, some had foam handles that were a slightly different color from the one you&#39;ll find on tripods from the company.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;When counterfeiters attempt to sell in our store, they not only violate the intellectual property rights of companies like GoPro, they also mislead consumers and harm Amazon&#39;s reputation as a place to buy authentic goods,&quot; said Kebharu Smith, director of Amazon&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-counterfeit-crimes-unit-095555911.html">recently formed Counterfeit Crimes Unit</a>.</p><p>Amazon and GoPro aren&#39;t the first companies to take legal action against fraudsters using the platform to sell counterfeit goods.

It&#39;s also not clear how many people bought a counterfeit product, and either didn&#39;t think to contact the company about their purchase or were none the wiser about what they had in their possession.

Many sous vide machines cost hundreds of dollars, but those looking to give the method a go don&#39;t have to spend that much now thanks to a new sale on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Anova&#39;s Precision Cooker Nano" href="https://amzn.to/3s3XQ58">Anova&#39;s Precision Cooker Nano</a>.

The method involves cooking food in a sealable bag that&#39;s submerged in heated water. The Precision Cooker Nano and other devices like it constantly circulate the water and keep it at the right temperature, ensuring your food is never over- or undercooked.</p><p>The Nano is the entry-level machine in Anova&#39;s lineup, making it the right pick for sous vide newbies. It uses 750 watts of power to heat up water and it&#39;ll run for up to 3,000 hours before it needs to be recharged. With that amount of power, you&#39;ll be able to easily cook meals for up to four people.</p><p>Aside from wattage and battery capacity, it differs from the more advanced devices in Anova&#39;s lineup in its clamp and connectivity. It has a fixed clamp, rather than a removable and adjustable one, that you&#39;ll use to secure the machine to your cooking pot.

The Show 5 remains a handy nightstand companion, with solid sound quality for the money and a 2MP camera for video chats with family (there&#39;s a physical privacy shutter). The Show 8, meanwhile, has both strong sound quality and a 13MP wide-angle camera that can track you as you walk around. It may hit the sweet spot if you&#39;re looking for a kitchen display that will help you chat with friends while you cook dinner.</p><p>The same catches remain.

The Echo Show isn&#39;t for you if you want to revisit <em>Loki</em> or <em>Hacks</em>. Amazon still has a very robust smart home ecosystem, though, and the wide range of Alexa skills could be helpful if you ever need a specialized voice app.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-5-8-kids-frames-sale-140208954.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">863b70ca-efec-4aac-9e8d-c42908217758</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 14:02:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628515884</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T13:31:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b8f4e3c0-f90d-11eb-aedf-7d07012b9b10" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b8f4e3c0-f90d-11eb-aedf-7d07012b9b10" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nicole Lee/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5 (2021) smart display]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Echo Show 5 (2021) smart display]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Beats Studio Buds drop to a new record low of $130]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While leaks somewhat spoiled their launch, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beats&#39; Studio Buds" href="https://amzn.to/3fLrDdY">Beats&#39; Studio Buds</a> impressed us with their comfortable new design, balanced sound and seamless pairing with both Android and iOS devices. They were priced right, too, coming in at $150. But now the buds are on sale for the first time since they came out in June, so you can grab them for only $130 from Amazon. All three colors have been discounted, so you can choose your favorite and save $20.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Beats Studio Buds at Amazon - $130" href="https://amzn.to/3fLrDdY">Buy Beats Studio Buds at Amazon - $130</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We gave the Beats Studio Buds a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html#callquality">score of 84</a> and we consider them to be the best pair of Beats buds for most people. They have a smaller, more comfortable design that some past Beats earbuds and their IPX4 water-resistant housing will keep them safe even during your sweatiest workouts. The buds pump out good sound with punchy bass and they work with Apple&#39;s Spatial Audio feature, too. You&#39;re also getting noise-cancellation that uses adaptive gain control to adjust in real time, blocking out distracting noises like that from dishwashers, wind and more. As far as battery life goes, the Studio Buds should get five to eight hours on a single charge, depending on your ANC use.</p><p>You may think that because these are Beats earbuds that they&#39;re designed with Apple users in mind, first and foremost. However, Beats added a number of new features that make these buds better for Android users, too. They still have the H1 chip inside, so you&#39;ll get fast pairing and switching between Apple devices. But Android users also have a Fast Pair feature now, too, which allows Android devices to immediately recognize the buds during the initial setup. The Studio Buds work with Android&#39;s Find My Device feature, so you can use that to see the last known location of your buds.</p><p>There&#39;s a lot to like about the Beats Studio Buds, especially at this $130 sale price. However, they lack a few key features: wireless charging, onboard volume controls and sound customizations. We also weren&#39;t impressed with their call quality either. But if you&#39;re willing to sacrifice in those areas, the Studio Buds remain solid options for both Android and iOS users who want a reliable, comfortable pair of wireless earbuds that won&#39;t break the bank.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-sale-130-amazon-133550651.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d33aed58-67d5-44c5-a458-1b77ee658b70</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 13:35:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628515867</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T13:31:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ada5d231-ccb3-11eb-8b5f-79802a7032a0" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ada5d231-ccb3-11eb-8b5f-79802a7032a0" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats’ latest true wireless earbuds have a design with more universal appeal than its Powerbeats Pro.

It&#39;s also worth noting that the <a href="https://amzn.to/3CzNDCu">AirPods Pro</a> remain $60 off, bringing them down to $190.</p><p>Even if you haven&#39;t used AirPods before, you&#39;re probably quite familiar with them, especially if you use a lot of Apple products. They&#39;re the company&#39;s true wireless earbuds that, thanks to the H1 chipset inside, pair and switch seamlessly between iPhone, iPad and other Apple devices. It makes the initial setup quick and easy, and it allows you to go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your Mac with little delay. The H1 chip also improved upon the AirPods&#39; connection range, and it enables hands-free Siri access, too.</p><p>Convenience alone is reason enough for some to invest in AirPods, but they&#39;re also a solid pair of wireless earbuds as well. Sound quality is decent (we prefer the AirPods Pro if you want the best sound quality Apple earbuds can offer) and they&#39;ll last for about five hours on a single charge. And with the wireless charging case, you can set the AirPods on any Qi-compatible pad you have in your home when you need extra juice.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-wireless-charging-case-sale-amazon-124337805.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6d05b1c-bdb9-4530-96e3-18b21c6e3a88</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 12:43:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628513021</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T12:43:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/9b12fa70-e79f-11ea-bebd-5d587fda2efa" width="2000" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/9b12fa70-e79f-11ea-bebd-5d587fda2efa" width="2000" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Tesla delays another vehicle to 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tesla’s electric pickup isn’t going anywhere this year.
