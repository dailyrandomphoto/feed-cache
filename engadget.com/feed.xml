One of those changes is layered clothing, which it&#39;s been working on <a href="https://twitter.com/bloxy_news/status/1286711089883828225?lang=en">since at least 2020</a>. It allows any type of character model to be outfitted with layered clothing items. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/14/roblox-avatar-updates-rdc-2021/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> explains that the feature ensures clothing items will fit avatars and will drape around them naturally, whether they&#39;re human- or dinosaur-shaped. At the moment, players can only access the feature in the beta version of Roblox Studio&#39;s avatar editor, and it&#39;s unclear when it&#39;ll be more widely available.</p><div id="4f82fc75e1b04d2cb2b708e7e227e4df"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here&#39;s a preview of what 3D Layered Clothing will look like within the Roblox Avatar Editor. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RDC2021?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#RDC2021</a><a href="https://t.co/wjYLNS0Ntn">pic.twitter.com/wjYLNS0Ntn</a></p>— Bloxy News | #RDC2021 (@Bloxy_News) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bloxy_News/status/1448731709118181383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 14, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Roblox CEO David Baszucki said during the keynote:</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>&quot;Self-identity is a crucial pillar of the metaverse, and the ability to precisely customize your clothing to your unique avatar is paramount in personal expression&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Roblox has also announced a feature called Dynamic Heads that can provide facial animations for avatars. The animations could link with facial tracking, so the character&#39;s mouth can move in time with its words. <em>TechCrunch</em> says the feature was made possible by the company&#39;s <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/roblox-buys-digital-avatar-startup-loom-ai/">acquisition</a> of digital avatar startup Loom.ai last year.&nbsp;</p><p>It&#39;ll be a long time before facial animations become an official part of the game, though — Roblox has only given developers access to it right now, so they can play around with it and test it out. &quot;These releases represent important stepping stones in a long line of innovations to improve the expressiveness and combinatorics in the metaverse,&quot; Daniel Sturman, Chief Technology Officer for Roblox, wrote in his recap for the event.</p><div id="4e217b65a5214c4ab05b9a2c4c9c9fc4"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Roblox has thousands of ways to express yourself.

Forkner, Boeing&#39;s former chief technical pilot involved in the company&#39;s 737 Max testing, was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-boeing-737-max-chief-technical-pilot-indicted-fraud">indicted</a> for fraud by a grand jury in Texas. Due to his position with the company, he was in charge of coordinating with the Federal Aviation Administration to determine the kind of training a pilot needs to fly a particular plane. The indictment <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/14/boeing-pilot-involved-in-737-max-jetliner-testing-is-indicted-in-texas-.html">accuses</a> him of deceiving the agency&#39;s Aircraft Evaluation Group (FAA AEG) when it evaluated and certified the 737 Max model. If you&#39;ll recall, two 737 Max planes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-12-boeing-software-update-737-max.html">crashed</a> within months of each other in 2018 and 2019, killing 346 people.</p><p>Forkner allegedly provided the FAA with &quot;materially false, inaccurate, and incomplete information about a new part of the flight controls for the Boeing 737 MAX called the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS).&quot; In both crashes, the AEG determined after an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-18-boeing-737-max-faa-certification-flaws.html">investigation</a> that MCAS, a system designed to push the plane&#39;s nose down in certain situations, activated during the flight. The planes that crashed — Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 — nosedived almost as soon as they took off.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the Department of Justice, Forkner discovered an important change to MCAS in November 2016, but he allegedly withheld that information from the AEG. As a result, the FAA removed all reference to MCAS in the pilot training materials for the 737 Max. Acting US Attorney Chad E. Meacham for the Northern District of Texas said in a statement that the former chief pilot&#39;s actions were financially motivated:</p><blockquote><p>“In an attempt to save Boeing money, Forkner allegedly withheld critical information from regulators. His callous choice to mislead the FAA hampered the agency’s ability to protect the flying public and left pilots in the lurch, lacking information about certain 737 MAX flight controls. The Department of Justice will not tolerate fraud — especially in industries where the stakes are so high.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Earlier this year, Boeing agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/boeing-2-5-billion-conspiracy-charge-737-max-crashes-073650876.html">pay $2.5 billion</a> to settle the criminal charge that it had conspired to defraud the FAA. It also agreed to work with the FAA&#39;s fraud section for any ongoing and future investigations. As for Forkner, he was charged with two counts of fraud involving aircraft parts and four counts of wire fraud. He&#39;s now facing a sentence of up to 100 years in prison.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/boeing-chief-technical-pilot-737-max-fraud-charge-052259455.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">366fde33-757d-4953-87b0-62cb1bb4200c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 05:22:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634275388</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T05:23:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-12/49bdf3a0-201c-11ea-ba2b-57b11595aff2" width="8256" height="5504" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-12/49bdf3a0-201c-11ea-ba2b-57b11595aff2" width="8256" height="5504" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Robert Michaud via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Grounded Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft fleet of Southwest Airlines in storage at Victorville, CA. on May 4, 2019]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[737 MAX Southwest]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Alienware celebrates its 25th birthday with a redesigned flagship gaming desktop]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/alienware">Alienware</a> began operations 25 years ago in a garage near Miami, and the Dell-owned brand is celebrating the milestone anniversary with a stylish gaming PC. The latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-aurora-desktop-intel-11th-gen-150009385.html">Aurora system</a> has a redesigned chassis that has extra internal space and more efficient airflow, and it should run more quietly.</p><p>The open-air Legend 2.0 chassis increases the internal volume by 50 percent compared with Aurora R12 or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-m15-m17-rtx-30-gpus-174537703.html">R10</a> without major changes to the overall size of the machine, Alienware says. You won&#39;t need any tools to open up the shell, so you&#39;ll have easier access to the components. There&#39;s an optional transparent side panel, so you can look inside and see a motherboard lit up with up to eight zones of AlienFX lighting. In addition, Alienware is also offering an optional magnetic cable cover to keep the back of the system in order.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/56f0be50-2ac3-11ec-89eb-86fd214c2a98" alt="Alienware Aurora with optional rear magnetic cover to keep cables tidy" data-uuid="4ee405a9-7111-3ce8-ace4-1e8d6598c77b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Alienware</div></figure><p>As part of the redesign, Alienware focused on improving the airflow. Every system has two 120mm fans, an intake and an exhaust. Depending on the configuration, Alienware may include one or two more fans: first, a second intake and then, if needed, a top exhaust. Since this is an Aurora system, there are of course liquid cooling options too.</p><p>Along with keeping your system cool while you&#39;re running games at max settings, Alienware says the fans can make the PC quieter. Compared with the previous generation system, the brand claims the new Aurora is up to 16 percent quieter when idle and up to nine percent less noisy during CPU-intensive tasks. While you&#39;re overclocking, the PC can make up to 15 percent less noise. In addition, Alienware says the PC can offer a five percent increase in graphics performance compared with the Aurora R12.</p><p>There are two color options for the Aurora: Lunar Light and Dark Side of the Moon. In other words, white and black. Alienware will reveal more details about the specs, pricing and availability later this fall.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alienware-aurora-redesign-airflow-noise-performance-040051724.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a67d68d7-0114-4d30-8b5f-d941f613becb</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 04:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634240482</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T19:41:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/96eb38f0-2ac3-11ec-afff-356f16b44e2b" width="3361" height="2133" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/96eb38f0-2ac3-11ec-afff-356f16b44e2b" width="3361" height="2133" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alienware]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Images of the Alienware Aurora with the Legend 2.0 chassis.

Amazon couldn&#39;t <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-european-commission-antitrust-report-135254227.html">misuse seller data</a> to compete against those sellers, for example, while Apple wouldn&#39;t be allowed to unfairly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-apple-app-store-search-rank-changes.html">rank its apps above others</a> in the App Store.&nbsp;</p><p>The senators characterized AICO as a modernization of antitrust law. It tackles the &quot;exclusionary conduct&quot; you see in leading platforms, Klobuchar said. Penalties would be steep, including fines of up to 15 percent of a company&#39;s revenue during the period when it broke the law.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The necessary House equivalent to the bill recently cleared that wing&#39;s Judiciary Committee and is waiting for a vote. Both bills stand a better-than-usual chance of passing thanks to both bipartisan support and a Biden administration focused on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-smaller-acquisitions-tech-giants-091043343.html">improving competition in technology</a>. The Senators have kept Biden&#39;s camp &quot;informed&quot; about work on the bill, Klobuchar added.</p><p>Industry lobbying groups like the Chamber of Progress (which counts tech firms like Amazon and Google in its ranks) have unsurprisingly balked at the bill. They contend the measure wouldn&#39;t be effective, and might even hurt favorite products. Not that this opposition will necessarily carry much weight. Senators have characterized this period as Big Tech&#39;s &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html">big tobacco moment</a>&quot; — that is, it&#39;s finally being held accountable for harmful behavior. Politicians across the spectrum appear eager to keep tech companies in check, and AICO may be one of their best near-term opportunities to rein in those corporate giants.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senate-american-innovation-choice-online-act-213803248.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3f7f783-391e-4b87-8a5e-fab83b74c70a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 21:38:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634247013</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T21:30:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d83f6970-2d2f-11ec-979b-77c4db0019a7" width="4363" height="2909" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d83f6970-2d2f-11ec-979b-77c4db0019a7" width="4363" height="2909" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, DC - SEPTEMBER 14: Sen.

The findings come from a report a team of researchers from the<a href="https://csmapnyu.org/"><ins>Center for Social Media and Politics at New York University</ins></a> shared with<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/14/technology/distortions-youtube-policies.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. In the immediate aftermath of the US election on November 3rd, the researchers recorded a dramatic increase in the number of YouTube election fraud videos shared on Twitter. That month, those clips represented approximately one-third of all election-related videos shared on the platform.</p><p>After December 8th, the day YouTube said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-removes-videos-with-us-election-fraud-claims-154726251.html"><ins>remove videos</ins></a> that claimed widespread errors and fraud changed the outcome of the contest, there was a dramatic drop in misleading election claims on Twitter. In that time period, the ratio of election fraud videos shared on Twitter from YouTube dropped to below 20 percent. That ratio fell again following the US Capitol riot when YouTube said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-election-fraud-video-bans-175750369.html"><ins>hand out strikes</ins></a> to any channel spreading misinformation about the results of the election. By the time President Biden swore the Oath of Office on January 20th, only around five percent of all election fraud videos on Twitter were coming from YouTube.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The researchers saw that same trend play out on Facebook. Before YouTube’s December 8th policy decision, about 18 percent of all videos shared on the platform were related to election fraud theories. By Inauguration Day, that number fell to four percent. To compile their findings, the team at New York University collected a random sampling of 10 percent of all tweets each day and then isolated the ones that linked out to YouTube videos. They did the same on Facebook using the company’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-11-facebook-buys-crowdtangle-content-tracking.html"><ins>CrowdTangle</ins></a> tool.</p><p>If nothing else, the findings highlight the outsized role YouTube plays in how information is shared in our current moment. As the most ubiquitous video platform on the internet, the company has an enormous amount of power to shape political discourse. Its policies can do both great harm and good. “It’s a huge part of the information ecosystem,” Megan Brown, a researcher at the Center for Social Media and Politics told <em>The Times</em>. “When YouTube’s platform becomes healthier, others do as well.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/new-york-university-youtube-misinformation-report-212302307.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2be47c4b-3671-432d-9f21-0411d326eb6a</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 21:23:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634246584</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T21:23:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/877972b0-017b-11ea-add6-088504b9b34b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/877972b0-017b-11ea-add6-088504b9b34b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anatoliy Sizov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tyumen, Russia - April 30,2019: YouTube App icon channel on iPhone XR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[YouTube App icon channel on iPhone XR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US Army delays Microsoft's $22 billion HoloLens deal]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>American soldiers won&#39;t be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-wins-10-year-contract-supplying-ar-tech-to-the-us-army-193910504.html">training with HoloLens headsets</a> for a while. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-army-pushes-back-date-microsoft-goggles-says-fully-committed-219-bln-deal-2021-10-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a> and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsofts-22-billion-augmented-reality-headset-deal-us-army-gets-delayed"><em>Windows Central</em></a> report the US Army has delayed the deployment of the HoloLens-based Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) by a year, to September 2022. <em>Janes</em><a href="https://www.janes.com/defence-news/c4isr-command-tech/latest/us-army-and-microsoft-working-to-mature-ivas-technology-delays-operational-testing-and-fielding">understood</a> the delay was prompted by the need to bump operational testing from July this year to May 2022 to &quot;further mature&quot; the mixed reality technology.</p><p>The Defense Department&#39;s Inspector General <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2021/Oct/13/2002872906/-1/-1/1/D2022-D000AU-0013.000.PDF">launched</a> an audit earlier in October to determine whether or not Microsoft&#39;s system would meet requirements. It&#39;s not clear if the audit is linked to the delay.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This didn&#39;t mean the military-oriented HoloLens was in trouble. The Army maintained it was &quot;fully committed&quot; to the nearly $22 billion IVAS contract, and had conducted tests as recently as September. The branch planned to &quot;regularly&quot; conduct tests through its fiscal 2022, which ends September of next year.</p><p>IVAS is meant to serve as both a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-06-us-army-shows-hololens-use.html">combat assistant and training tool</a>. Infantry will see squad positions and other vital data in the field, complete with night vision — they&#39;ll ideally have the kind of situational awareness previously reserved for video games. In training, the headsets can supply data to help instructors improve specific techniques.</p><p>The delay won&#39;t do much to allay criticism of the HoloLens deal from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-23-microsoft-workers-demand-end-to-hololens-contract-with-army.html">inside Microsoft</a>. Employees have long objected to Microsoft directly supporting the military and &#39;gamifying&#39; war, especially as workers didn&#39;t have input on the decision. Microsoft isn&#39;t likely to change its tune, though. The company sees IVAS a way to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-25-microsoft-ceo-defends-hololens-army-contract.html">aid and protect the troops</a> rather than an offensive weapon — and losing the contract would clearly hurt both Microsoft&#39;s bottom line and momentum for HoloLens at large.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-army-delays-microsoft-hololens-deal-202233405.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6261edbb-a91a-4c29-bef7-b4c30f307f7d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 20:22:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634242958</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T20:22:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/292ed390-2d24-11ec-affb-925da7ecb655" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/292ed390-2d24-11ec-affb-925da7ecb655" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Courtney Bacon/US Army]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US Army soldier using Microsoft HoloLens headset prototype]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[US Army soldier using Microsoft HoloLens headset prototype]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Chrome OS adds more natural voices for 'Select-to-speak' accessibility feature]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dyslexia affects as much as <a href="https://dyslexia.yale.edu/dyslexia/dyslexia-faq/"><ins>20 percent of the population</ins></a> and is one of the most common learning disabilities.

To wit, it has only just pulled back the curtain on Hazard Zone, one of the game&#39;s three main modes, a month before the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-delayed-november-19th-204450521.html"><ins>November 19th release date</ins></a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-briefing-exploring-battlefield-hazard-zone"><ins>Hazard Zone</ins></a> is about getting into the arena, retrieving data drives and escaping via an extraction point before a storm overwhelms you or enemies take you out. Only two teams can make it out, as only a couple of extraction windows will pop up at random locations (though only one player needs to get out for their team to win). Matches run for up to 20 minutes and will take place across all seven of <em>Battlefield 2042</em>&#39;s maps.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="11774d2a7a8c4d25a8c985fbfbaa1c2b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nkMiPwL8G1w?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Survival is key here. You only have one life, but one of your three teammates can resurrect you if you&#39;re killed. Once your entire team is wiped out, it&#39;s game over. Still, if you&#39;re sneaky enough, you can win a match without firing a shot. Some satellites will already be on the ground at the start of a game, and more will drop in as the round progresses, so you&#39;ll need to adjust your strategy as you go.</p><p>Before the start of a round, you and your teammates can kit yourselves out with gadgets. Players can use money earned in previous matches (primarily by making it out with data drives) to buy gear like a scanner that shows data drive locations, a healing upgrade and a Squad Redeploy Call-in. The latter lets you revive dead squad mates; otherwise, you&#39;ll need to find a Redeploy Uplink somewhere on the map to bring back your buddies.</p><p>All of the XP you earn will go toward your overall Battlefield 2042 progression, which will boost your player level and unlock weapons. Teams are made up of unique characters — players will need to find specialists and loadouts that work in harmony to increase their chances of success.</p><p>Hazard Zone isn&#39;t quite a battle royale mode, since you don&#39;t need to be the last squad standing to win.

The journalist disclosed a Department of Elementary and Secondary Education web app flaw that let anyone see over 100,000 teachers&#39; Social Security numbers in site source code, and Parson interpreted this as a &quot;political game&quot; meant to &quot;embarrass the state&quot; — that is, a malicious hack.</p><p>The governor has already referred the case to the Cole County Prosecutor, and even has the Missouri Highway State Patrol investigating. An attorney for <em>The Post-Dispatch</em> maintained that the reporter &quot;did the responsible thing&quot; by sharing the flaw with the government to get it fixed. The lawyer also helpfully refreshed Parson on his internet lingo. A hacker is someone who &quot;subverts&quot; security with sinister intent, not a reporter trying to bolster security by sharing publicly available information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This flaw wasn&#39;t recent, either. University of Missouri-St. Louis professor Shaji Khan told <em>The Post-Dispatch</em> that this kind of vulnerability had been known for &quot;at least&quot; 10 years, and that it was &quot;mind boggling&quot; the Department would let these problems linger.

However, this highlights an all-too-familiar problem with politicians that don&#39;t understand tech. It doesn&#39;t just lead to embarrassments, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-republicans-letter-to-2017-yahoo-ceo-211537563.html">letters to long-gone CEOs</a> — it can discourage responsible security disclosures and put thousands of people at risk.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/missouri-governor-says-security-181152203.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9e47711b-fc23-4eb8-9e5b-5d88cb4ed8c9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 18:11:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634235117</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T18:12:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/c9f60f10-d608-11ea-a7f9-39dc6ff5cc68" width="3332" height="2217" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/c9f60f10-d608-11ea-a7f9-39dc6ff5cc68" width="3332" height="2217" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jacob Moscovitch via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[JEFFERSON CITY, MO - MAY 29: Gov.

One year after suffering a decisive defeat at the Battle of Stalingrad, a Nazi officer named Oberführer Wolfram Von List finds a mysterious artifact that binds him to an entity called Kortifex, allowing him to summon an army of the undead. It’s up to you and as many as three other players to battle through the ruins of Stalingrad and stop him.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you play through a match and complete objectives, you’ll find items called Sacrificial Hearts. You can offer these at an Altar of Covenants to access randomized upgrades that will tweak your playstyle. One of those upgrades will reload your weapons while they’re holstered, while another will allow you to turn zombies into temporary allies.</p><p>Any experience you earn while playing Zombies will count toward <em>Vanguard’s </em>Batte Pass, which also shares progression between multiplayer and <em>Warzone</em>. The mode will also support cross-platform play between different consoles. As mentioned above, <em>Vanguard</em> launches on November 5th.

Rep. Frank Pallone and other House Democrats are <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ec-leaders-announce-legislation-to-reform-section-230">introducing</a> a bill, the Justice Against Malicious Algorithms Act (JAMA), that would make internet platforms liable when they &quot;knowingly or recklessly&quot; use algorithms to recommend content that leads to physical or &quot;severe emotional&quot; harm. They&#39;re concerned online giants like Facebook are knowingly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety-062311634.html">amplifying harmful material</a>, and that companies should be held responsible for this damage.</p><p>The key sponsors, including Reps. Mike Doyle, Jan Schakowsky and Anna Eshoo, pointed to whistleblower <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-senate-hearing-161557412.html">Frances Haugen&#39;s Senate testimony</a> as supposed evidence of Facebook&#39;s algorithm abuse. Her statements were proof Facebook was abusing the Communications Decency Act&#39;s Section 230 &quot;well beyond congressional intent,&quot; according to Eshoo. Haugen alleged that Facebook knew its social networks were harmful to children and spread &quot;divisive and extreme&quot; content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The bill only applies to services with over 5 million monthly users, and won&#39;t cover basic online infrastructure (such as web hosting) or user-specified searches. JAMA will go before the House on October 15th.</p><p>As with past proposed reforms, there are no guarantees JAMA will become law. Provided it passes the House, an equivalent measure still has to clear a Senate that has been hostile to some Democrat bills. The parties have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html">historically disagreed</a> on how to change Section 230 — Democrats believe it doesn&#39;t require enough moderation for hate and misinformation, while Republicans have claimed it enables censorship of conservative viewpoints. The bill&#39;s vaguer concepts, such as &#39;reckless&#39; algorithm use and emotional damage, might raise fears of over-broad interpretations.</p><p>The bill could still send a message even if it dies, though. Pallone and the other JAMA backers argue the &quot;time for self-regulation is over&quot; — they&#39;re no longer convinced social media heavyweights like Facebook can apologize, implement a few changes and carry on. This won&#39;t necessarily lead to a more strictly regulated social media space, but it could put more pressure on social networks to implement far-reaching policy changes.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/house-bill-justice-against-malicious-algorithms-act-162915185.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ff266b55-6c5c-4880-b206-8d5c61625443</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 16:29:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634228958</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T16:29:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cab37e10-2d05-11ec-baff-2d08b551adc9" width="5214" height="3475" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cab37e10-2d05-11ec-baff-2d08b551adc9" width="5214" height="3475" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tom Williams via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UNITED STATES - SEPTEMBER 17: Rep.

Smartwatches have all but taken over the mainstream wearable space, but the humble fitness tracker remains an option for those who want a gadget to do one thing right all the time. Despite the headwinds, there are still a bunch of fitness bands out there to choose from. Engadget has tested many of them and picked out the best for most people.</p><h2>What do fitness trackers do best?</h2><p>The answer seems simple: Fitness trackers are best at monitoring exercise, be it a 10-minute walk around the block or that half marathon you’ve been diligently training for. Obviously, smartwatches can do that too, but there are some areas where fitness bands have the upper hand: focus, design, battery life and price.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>When I say “focus,” I’m alluding to the fact that fitness trackers are made to track activity well; anything else is extra. They often don’t have the bells and whistles that smartwatches do, which could distract from their activity-tracking abilities. They also tend to have fewer sensors and internal components, which keeps them smaller and lighter. Fitness trackers are also a better option for those who just want a less conspicuous device on their wrists all day.</p><p>Battery life tends to be better on fitness trackers, too. While most smartwatches last one to two days on a single charge, fitness bands will last five days to one week — and that’s with all-day and all-night use.</p><p>When it comes to price, there’s no competition. Most worthwhile smartwatches start at $175 to $200, but you can get a solid fitness tracker starting at $70. Yes, more expensive bands exist (and we recommend a few here), but you’ll find more options under $150 in the fitness tracker space than in the smartwatch space.</p><h2>When to get a smartwatch instead</h2><p>If you need a bit more from your wearable, you’ll likely want a smartwatch instead. There are things like on-watch apps, alerts and even more robust fitness features that smartwatches have and fitness trackers don’t. You can use one to control smart home appliances, set timers and reminders, check weather reports and more. Some smartwatches let you choose which apps you want to receive alerts from, and the options go beyond just call and text notifications.</p><p>But the extra fitness features are arguably the most important thing to think about when deciding between a fitness tracker and a smartwatch. The latter devices tend to be larger, giving them more space for things like GPS, barometers, onboard music storage and more. While you can find built-in GPS on select fitness trackers, it’s not common.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h3>Best overall: Fitbit Charge 5</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7aa23d72-1fb4-11ec-bbaf-4e7c2ddd9958" alt="Fitbit Charge 5 fitness tracker" data-uuid="e9ae33c2-cb2a-327c-9492-d769fe8b08c7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valentina Palladino / Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fitbit&#39;s Charge 5" href="https://amzn.to/3ax6MYI">Fitbit&#39;s Charge 5</a> has everything most people would want in a fitness tracker. First and foremost, it&#39;s not a smartwatch. That means it has a slightly lower profile on the wrist and lasts days on a single charge while tracking activity and sleep. It also has a full-color AMOLED display — a big improvement from the smaller, grayscale screen on last year&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Charge 4" href="https://amzn.to/3AE7BcR">Charge 4</a>. That display, along with a thinner design, make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-charge-5-review-130043489.html">Charge 5</a> feel more premium than its predecessor.</p><p>But it also costs $180 — $30 more than the Charge 4 — and that&#39;s due in part to the design upgrades but also some additional features. The Charge 5 has EDA sensors for stress tracking and it will eventually support ECG measurements and Daily Readiness Scores (the latter is for only for Premium subscribers). Those are on top of existing features that were carried over from the Charge 4 — most notably, Fitbit Pay support and built-in GPS. The former lets you pay for coffee or groceries with a swipe of your wrist, while the latter helps map outdoor runs, bike rides and other activities. Built-in GPS remains the star of the show here — it&#39;s fast and accurate, making the Charge 5 the best option if you want a do-it-all wearable that’s focused on fitness.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ax6MYI" id="d1ca259d593643fdb9f4308e6ea3981a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Charge 5 at Amazon - $180</a><h3>Alternative: Garmin Vivosmart 4</h3><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/b4cf0fe0-9ad2-11ea-afff-9457f212280b" alt="Garmin Vivosmart 4 fitness tracker."><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>A more subtle-looking alternative is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:$100 Garmin Vivosmart 4" href="https://amzn.to/3bXCFek">$100 Garmin Vivosmart 4</a>. It’s thinner than the Charge 5 and fits in a bit better with bracelets and other jewelry you might wear regularly. But its attractive design is only part of its appeal — Garmin knows how to track fitness, and the Vivosmart 4 is proof that you don’t need to drop hundreds on one of the company’s fitness watches to get a capable device.</p><p>Like the Charge 5, the Vivosmart 4 tracks all-day activity and sleep and has a pulse ox sensor for blood oxygen saturation measurements. It has only connected GPS capabilities, and it has universal music controls that can control the playback of most anything. The band is also waterproof and can track basic swim workouts, plus it also has a battery life of up to seven days. While it’s similar to the Charge 5 in that the Vivosmart 4 works with both Android and iOS devices, it’s a bit more flexible as it syncs with Apple Health (the Charge 5 and other Fitbit devices do not).</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3bXCFek" id="f778f223975c4829ae1a977f02e45f03" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Vivosmart 4 at Amazon - $130</a><h3>Best budget: Fitbit Inspire 2</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/8d3f0ff0-8b10-11eb-aaad-d9712ec51fcb" alt="A smartphone with the Tile app and a black Fitbit are shown against a dark grey background."><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Fitbit / Tile</div></figure><p>If you only have $100 to spare, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fitbit Inspire 2" href="https://amzn.to/2XZ8Eqi">Fitbit Inspire 2</a> is the best option. It strips out all the luxury features from the Charge 5 and keeps only the essentials. You won’t get built-in GPS, Fitbit Pay or Spotify control but you do get excellent activity tracking, automatic workout detection, smartphone alerts and plenty more. As the updated version of the Inspire HR, the Inspire 2 includes a heart rate monitor, which the device uses to keep track of all-day heart rate, active zone minutes, sleep stages and more.</p><p>The Inspire HR is thinner than the Charge 5 but it also has interchangeable bands, so you can switch up its style whenever you feel like it. Its design is also swimproof, and it should last up to 10 days on a single charge. Fitbit also recently added Tile-tracking to the Inspire 2, allowing you to find your misplaced band using the Bluetooth locator feature and the Tile mobile app. All of these features make it the best value fitness tracker you can get.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2XZ8Eqi" id="6251817b585f46ec89595360bea1021f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Inspire 2 at Fitbit - $100</a><h3>Alternative: Samsung Galaxy Fit 2</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/38b0a5e0-ed57-11ea-b3fa-b00fd774f28d" alt="Samsung Galaxy Fit 2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:$60 Samsung Galaxy Fit 2" href="https://amzn.to/3vAtCHS">$60 Samsung Galaxy Fit 2</a> band is almost like a more affordable Garmin Vivosmart 4. The two trackers share the same skeletal design but the Galaxy Fit looks a bit more utilitarian — you can swap out its bands, though — something you can’t do on Garmin’s device.</p><p>We haven’t given the Fit 2 the full review treatment, but Engadget’s Cherlynn Low was impressed with the original Galaxy Fit: the Tizen-based interface is colorful and easy to use, and plenty of people will appreciate its durable, no-nonsense design. It tracks a bunch of workouts as well and even has auto-exercise recognition. That’s on top of its daily activity tracking and sleep monitor, all of which uses the built-in heart rate monitor to collect pulse data throughout the day.</p><p>The kicker for the Galaxy Fit 2 is battery life — the tiny tracker can last for up to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-fit-2-announcement-202152684.html">15 days</a> on a single charge, and you can even extend it to 21 days if you change some settings. That’s much longer than most competing bands, so even if Samsung isn’t as comprehensive as Garmin or Fitbit is when it comes to fitness data collection and analysis, the Galaxy Fit 2 is a good option for those who want a basic tracker that they can safely forget to charge each night.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3vAtCHS" id="e23d4754b63442e3a65884849113b56e" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Fit 2 at Amazon - $60</a><h3>Most fashionable: Withings Move</h3><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/3c14bb30-9ad3-11ea-bfff-f779e183b4b4" alt="Withings Move fitness tracker."><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>All of the previously mentioned fitness trackers are attractive in their own way (bonus points to those that have interchangeable bands), but they share a similar look.

The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HTC Vive Flow" href="https://fave.co/3aFaMq6">HTC Vive Flow</a> is a pair of glasses weighing just 189 grams (6.6 ounces) which pair with a smartphone to let you play some VR content or simply watch TV. It’s marketed as both a piece of tech to keep you entertained and a device to help you improve your mental wellbeing.</p><p>Naturally, the company doesn’t want to talk too much about the technology inside Flow, preferring to focus on what it can do. What we do know, however, is that it has two “1.6K” displays running at a 75Hz refresh rate and offering a 100-degree field of vision. There’s no battery per-se, except for a tiny cell designed to make sure that it’ll shut down safely if Flow is severed from whatever power source you&#39;ve connected its USB-C cable to.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/35a60a60-2c2c-11ec-bef7-432109a2163d" alt="Image of the HTC Flow and its hard carrying case" data-uuid="49e9936a-fdbe-351b-980c-b02d65f09b54"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HTC</div></figure><p>It’s in this regard that it’s set up more like a personal cinema than it is your standard VR headset, especially with the fairly narrow body. HTC spent a lot of time and effort shrinking the distance between the display and your eyes, and Flow uses a pair of diopter lenses up front. It means that short-sighted folks won’t need to wear their glasses when using Flow, since they can set the lenses up to suit their comfort level.</p><p>To ensure that Flow really is portable, HTC set a power budget of 7.5 watts, the upper limit for USB 3’s charging spec. It means you can run this thing off any compatible battery pack (or your phone, in a pinch) as well as a standard socket over a USB-C cable. Some of that juice goes to powering a small active fan in front of the nose, which pulls cold air over your face and pushes warm air out of the Flow’s top vents.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5c69e630-2c2c-11ec-8a7d-1011f9140487" alt="Promotional image for the HTC Vive Flow" data-uuid="beda1b78-c99d-3204-82d3-7fddc9e1f29e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HTC</div></figure><p>HTC also spent plenty of time talking about how the dual-hinge system will ensure that the Flow’s glasses-like frame will sit comfortably on anyone’s head. A pair of speakers embedded into the arms offer what we’re told is surprisingly high quality spatial audio, and beefy given their relative size. And since they sit on your head like regular glasses, you can wear them laying down should the need arise.</p><p>You can pair Flow with your smartphone over Bluetooth or Miracast (for watching protected content) and use the phone as a pointer inside VR content. That limits the number of experiences you’ll be able to enjoy with the gear, but you were hardly going to be able to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-23-half-life-alyx-review-valve-vr.html"><em>Half Life: Alyx</em></a> on this thing anyway. A pair of camera lenses facing forward will, when the feature is ready, enable the Flow to track your hands for more immersive VR, too.</p><p>It&#39;s worth saying that this is not, and as I understand it, can never become an AR headset in its current form. Those lenses don&#39;t apparently offer much passthrough (beyond what&#39;s necessary for motion tracking) and this isn&#39;t designed for it anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>HTC says that the focus of Flow’s content on “wellbeing, brain training, productivity” and “light gaming,” with apps like <em>Color Connect VR</em>, <em>Space Slurpies</em> and VR meditation app <em>Tripp</em>. The headset will be able to access a special version of Viveport Infinity, offering a wide library of Flow-compatible content for a monthly fee of $5.99. The company added that if users wanted to meditate within the Flow towards the end of the day, a blue light filter will kick in to help ensure that you can get more restful sleep.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ae1d4620-2c2c-11ec-b9de-282854ccb5c7" alt="Image of the Diopter Lenses on the back of an HTC Vive Flow" data-uuid="fdb30deb-7d6e-3129-839b-4235c390625f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">HTC</div></figure><p>If you’re looking to get hold of an HTC Vive Flow, then pre-orders are opening from today, with shipping expected to begin in November. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:price is $499" href="https://fave.co/3aFaMq6">price is $499</a>, and for that you get the glasses and a soft carrying case thrown-in, but I’d strongly advise you to pre-order if you want one. Doing so entitles you to receive the flask-like hard carrying case, as well as seven pieces of additional VR content thrown in gratis.</p><p>Naturally, Flow has become something of a worst-kept secret in technology after many of these <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-flow-headset-images-leak-050326367.html">details were leaked ahead of time</a>. One of the obvious sticking points is the higher price compared to the Quest 2, although HTC was clear to dispel the notion that the products were equals. Flow, after all, is a not a standalone headset, and HTC believes that the lighter, more elegant hardware will win it fans in the health and fitness market.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-flow-lightweight-vr-headset-150014421.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5fde36c0-3cc3-472e-976e-08d9eaecb658</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 15:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634284816</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T08:00:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7adf6780-2c2b-11ec-affe-342a18f49884" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7adf6780-2c2b-11ec-affe-342a18f49884" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HTC]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Promotional image of the HTC Flow being used for meditation.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Flow]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[What to expect from Apple’s October 18th ‘Unleashed’ event]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-unleashed-macbook-pro-event-date-161136786.html"><ins>On October 18th</ins></a>, Apple will hold its second event of the fall and likely last event of the year. The invite the company sent out this time doesn’t provide any hints on what announcements we should expect, but thanks to a variety of leaks and reports, we have some good ideas about what it will show off.</p><h2>MacBook Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c3f773a0-b7e5-11eb-bfff-8865a6ff63da" style="height:1033;width:1600;" alt="Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019)" data-uuid="f0d39295-41ee-3565-9cd2-09a75f898c2f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>All signs point to new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models headlining the event. Apple will reportedly turn back the clock on its flagship laptop, undoing many of the design features that have defined the line since late 2016. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-2021-macbook-pro-may-mark-the-return-of-the-mag-safe-connector-091548032.html"><ins>MagSafe</ins></a> may be back on the table, as well as an HDMI port and SD card slot. Oh, and the Touch Bar will apparently get the axe, with a standard set of function keys set to replace the OLED strip.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Beyond those changes, the new MacBook Pro is expected to feature thinner bezels. According to display analyst Ross Young, it could even come with a mini-LED panel capable of refreshing its screen at 120Hz. Ross suggests that’s a feature both models could include, but knowing Apple, it may be something that’s only available on the top-tier 16-inch model or an add-on that costs extra. Additionally, there have been reports of the 14- and 16-inch models supporting maximum resolutions of 3,024 x 1,964 and 3,456 x 2,224, which would be a major upgrade over the current 13- and 16-inch MacBook Pros.</p><div id="d3aa476fb791429ea70b3813a8048251"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yes, new 14&quot; and 16&quot; MacBook Pro&#39;s will have miniLEDs and we believe they will also be 120Hz refresh.</p>— Ross Young (@DSCCRoss) <a href="https://twitter.com/DSCCRoss/status/1447967733971398665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Internally, the MacBook Pro will reportedly include Apple’s latest system-on-a-chip, possibly called the M1X. According to a recent report from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-new-macbook-pro-2021-m-1-x-152614042.html"><em><ins>Bloomberg’s </ins></em><ins>Mark Gurman</ins></a>, there will be two variants of the M1X, with the main difference between the two coming down to the number of graphics cores they have at their disposal. In addition to delivering faster performance than the M1, the new chip could come with support for up to 32GB of RAM, making it a much better fit for work like coding and video editing.</p><p>Speaking of the M1X, it could tie into the other announcements Apple has planned for October 18th. In August, Gurman said Apple was working on a redesigned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-mac-mini-m-1-x-rumor-194549101.html"><ins>Mac mini</ins></a> that will include the new processor and add additional ports. At the time, he noted the desktop would launch sometime within the “next several months.” Recent reports suggest that a new Mac mini isn’t a guarantee for next week, but Apple could still surprise us. We know from Gurman and analyst Ming-Chi Kuo that Apple is also working on a redesigned MacBook Air, but the company reportedly won’t announce that device <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/27/kuo-macbook-air-mass-production-third-quarter/">until sometime next year</a>.</p><h2>macOS Monterey</h2><h2></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/163fd870-da94-11eb-9fdf-182584dd7911" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="macOS Monterey Facetime Shareplay" data-uuid="791bda7b-5cb8-379e-a721-0396b520f4bb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>Given the timing of the event and the likely focus on Mac hardware, Apple will almost certainly announce a release date for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macos-monterey-182454905.html"><ins>macOS Monterey</ins></a>. The company previewed the next version of its desktop operating system at WWDC 2021, showing how features like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-delays-ios-15-shareplay-184450766.html"><ins>SharePlay</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-universal-control-ipad-macbook-imac-184045949.html"><ins>Universal Control</ins></a> will build on the enhancements it introduced with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macos-big-sur-review-180036335.html"><ins>Big Sur</ins></a> in 2020.

So it’s not clear just how heavily Apple plans to lean into the AirPods Pro design.</p><p>We’ll note here AirPods haven’t been a frequent feature of Apple’s hardware events. Outside of when it unveiled the earbuds back in 2016, Apple has announced all subsequent models, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-28-apple-airpods-pro-announced-active-noise-cancellation.html"><ins>AirPods Pro</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airdpods-studio-announced-specs-pricing-133623490.html"><ins>AirPods Max</ins></a>, through press releases. We can see the company doing the same here with the new “basic” model. One last thing the company could mention at the event is that Apple Music is coming to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-14-it-looks-like-apple-music-may-be-coming-to-playstation-5"><ins>PlayStation 4 and PS5</ins></a>. Given that you can already access <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-app-playstation-4-5-launch-availability-113246540.html"><ins>Apple TV from Sony’s consoles</ins></a>, it’s not a jump for the streaming service to become available there as well.</p><p>So there you have it, that’s everything we see Apple potentially sharing on October 18th. As always, the company could surprise us, so you’ll want to visit Engadget on the day of the event. We’ll have comprehensive coverage of the company’s latest announcements.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-what-to-expect-october-18-unleashed-142518973.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a0e2422b-e193-49a7-959d-8bb796f9ac53</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 14 Oct 2021 14:25:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634221675</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T14:28:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d37e0460-3eeb-11eb-b7f9-449e864b9135" width="1957" height="1213" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d37e0460-3eeb-11eb-b7f9-449e864b9135" width="1957" height="1213" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's latest MacBook Pro with an M1 chip.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Monument Valley 2’ gets a new chapter four years after its debut]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Four years after <em>Monument Valley 2</em> hit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-05-monument-valley-2-available-on-ios-now.html"><ins>iOS</ins></a> and <a href="http://html/"><ins>Android</ins></a>, Ustwo Games has added a new chapter.
