There may be an explanation for that momentary anguish, though. Google is <a href="https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1457043416139898881">telling</a> users that the Pixel 6&#39;s fingerprint reader is using &quot;enhanced security algorithms&quot; that may either take longer to check your digits or require better sensor contact.</p><p>Google hasn&#39;t elaborated on its statement. We&#39;ve asked Google for comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some users have suggested the sluggish performance might be due to Google&#39;s use of an optical under-display fingerprint reader instead of the ultrasonic sensor found in phones like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html">Galaxy S21</a>. However, Reddit users <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/qoayk3/made_by_google_the_pixel_6_fingerprint_sensor/">noted</a> there are phones with optical sensors that perform faster, such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-9-pro-review-hasselblad-cameras-price-performance-150053710.html">OnePlus 9</a>. There&#39;s a real chance software may play a role in the Pixel 6&#39;s quirks.</p><p>It&#39;s not certain if Google can or will address this through a software update. Whether or not it can, it&#39;s unlikely to provide an alternative beyond entering your passcode. Face unlock is typically insecure without a depth sensor present, as facial recognition systems can sometimes be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-16-facial-recognition-fooled-masks.html">fooled by masks</a> and photos.

The country&#39;s Interior Ministry said the attack involved three drones, including at least one bomb-laden vehicle. Six bodyguards were injured during the incident, and an official speaking talking to <em>Reuters</em> claimed security forces obtained the remnants of a small drone at the scene.</p><p>While the Iraqi government publicly said it was &quot;premature&quot; to identify culprits, <em>CBS</em> sources suspected the perpetrators belonged to pro-Iranian militias that have used similar tactics against Erbil International Airport and the US Embassy. The militias directly blamed al-Kadhimi for casualties in a fight between Iraqi security forces and pro-militia protesters who objected to their side&#39;s losses in an October 10th parliamentary vote.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Iraq, the US, Saudi Arabia and Iran have publicly condemned the attack. Militia leaders, however, suggested the drone attack might have been faked to distract from protesters&#39; reported deaths.</p><p>Drone-based terrorism isn&#39;t a completely novel concept. ISIS, for instance, modified off-the-shelf drones to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-16-isis-drones-weaponized-bombers-iraq-mosul.html">drop explosives</a>. Attacks against political leaders are still very rare, though. If accurate, the reported Iraqi plot suggests drone terrorism is entering a new phase — extremists are using robotic fliers to hit major targets too dangerous to strike using conventional methods.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iraq-prime-minister-drone-assassination-attempt-182450389.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5321a3a6-8c38-42be-9899-f00c2d5dc6ae</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 18:24:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636316874</ingested><modified>2021-11-07T20:28:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Unrest, Conflicts & War]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Armed Forces]]></category><category><![CDATA[Military & Defense]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/55668e30-3ff3-11ec-965f-838a973901a4" width="3574" height="1998" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/55668e30-3ff3-11ec-965f-838a973901a4" width="3574" height="1998" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Handout . / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A destroyed vehicle is parked in front of Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi's residence following an assassination attempt by an armed drone in Baghdad, Iraq in this screen grab taken from a handout video obtained by Reuters on November 7, 2021.

The details of the lobbying weren&#39;t revealed in the public disclosure, but the description suggested you would hail a taxi from the Uber app like you could in the company&#39;s earlier days.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Uber for comment, although it declined to speak to <em>The Post</em>. A TLC spokesperson shied away from discussing details, saying only that the Commission &quot;meets frequently&quot; with licensees to explore ideas and that it was focused on relief efforts for drivers struggling with taxi medallion debt.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yellow cab hailing might seem an unusual choice for a company that has routinely <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-23-judge-strikes-down-nyc-uber-lyft-cruising-cap.html">clashed with the taxi industry</a> and is frequently blamed for gutting NYC&#39;s cab demand. Uber would likely have to rethink its commissions to compensate taxi drivers who pay steep costs to operate in the city, and it could still face political opposition given its history.</p><p>Even so, it&#39;s easy to see why Uber might consider offering NYC taxis. The revival would increase the chances of passengers scoring some kind of ride through the Uber app, even if there aren&#39;t enough ridesharing drivers to go around. That could keep New Yorkers using the Uber app and increase the chances they&#39;ll use the company&#39;s more familiar options.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uber-new-york-city-yellow-taxi-cab-dispatch-171021741.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24e6d4dd-15a1-4c62-a045-5b018a5ae940</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 17:10:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636305024</ingested><modified>2021-11-07T17:10:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commercial Vehicles]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db3a1ed0-3fe6-11ec-be4d-f0421ee59efe" width="3367" height="2245" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/db3a1ed0-3fe6-11ec-be4d-f0421ee59efe" width="3367" height="2245" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[VIEW press via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 16: Yellow cabs and Uber car drive through Times Square on November 16, 2020 in New York City.

It’s something that makes Vi feel real, like she has a history that she carries with her, as natural as her pink hair.</p><p>Even though <em>Arcane </em>is packed with incredible action and delicious animation, small details like these truly bring the world to life — only for Jinx to blow it all to smithereens.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5abfa211-3dc6-11ec-b6e5-582f0cb3c203" alt="Arcane" data-uuid="4842e494-0d07-31cd-9970-98c201d2ac6d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Riot Games</div></figure><p><strong><em>Warning: Slight spoilers for the first four episodes of </em></strong><strong>Arcane</strong><strong><em> ahead.</em></strong></p><p><em>Arcane</em> begins with a quintessential story of class warfare, depicting violent clashes between the rich citizens of Piltover and the oppressed, criminal society of Zaun, where Vi, Jinx and their crew live. In the first three episodes, Vi and Jinx are kids: Vi is the leader of a small gang of teen outlaws, while Jinx — who actually goes by Powder at this time — is her little sister, a few years of heist experience and growth spurts behind the others. By the fourth episode, Vi and Jinx are older and on equal footing, even when they find themselves on opposite sides.</p><p>The sisters start out surrounded by their chosen family members, including their father figure, Vander, who acts as the unofficial mayor of Zaun. A former leader of the resistance, Vander runs a bar called The Last Drop and tries to keep the peace with the Enforcers, Piltover’s militarized security team. Meanwhile, scientists in Piltover are on the verge of harnessing synthetic magic, while the most vile forces in Zaun are creating monster soldiers by feeding people shimmering purple liquid. Altogether, it’s a recipe for war.</p><div id="70a64e99187f4c27ad384cc5bc6e6c98"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/32oT-CWJOC0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Arcane</em>’s disparate worlds are vibrant, vast and alive, Piltover shining gold among the clouds and Zaun buried beneath the dirt, filled with toxic green light. The show itself feels less like anime and more like an almost-R-rated Disney film, with buttery-smooth character movements and elaborate environments, courtesy of Riot Games’ go-to animation studio, Fortiche Production. The entire thing looks as if it were the product of motion-capture technology, but it’s hand-animated in a mix of 2D and 3D.</p><p>The fights in <em>Arcane</em> are particularly gorgeous. Vi is a boxer, diving in with her fists raised, while Jinx has a bunch of semi-functional homemade grenades covered in crayon scribbles, allowing her to participate from afar — even though she wants to be with the big kids, in the center of the action. The largest battles tend to play out in slow-motion, with emotional electronic music thrumming through the scenes and close-up shots of vicious punches, heavy kicks and last-second dodges. In wider angles, every frame of these fights has desktop-wallpaper potential.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f905b5d0-3dc7-11ec-b5fd-1f9dfff67124" alt="Arcane" data-uuid="067cbc52-a512-359f-84f7-9de16ff01b3d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Riot Games</div></figure><p><em>Arcane </em>takes its time establishing characters and revealing how they’re all intertwined, and by the end of episode three, this work crashes into a massive fight scene and pays off in a powerful way. In <em>League of Legends </em>lore, Vi and Jinx are bitter rivals, but in <em>Arcane</em>, they start off as sisters with a deep, true love for one another. They support each other, save each other’s lives, and fall apart together. They feel inseparable. It takes something catastrophic to rip them apart, and <em>Arcane</em> shows us every horrific second. It’s heartbreaking.</p><p>It’s not all about Vi and Jinx, and there are plenty of other <em>League of Legends</em> characters with starring roles in <em>Arcane</em>, including Viktor, Jayce, Ekko, Caitlyn and Heimerdinger. As a fan of the game, I feel a happy spark whenever I recognize a face or name in <em>Arcane</em>, but it won’t detract from the experience if you don’t already know who these people are. This is an origin story, after all.</p><section data-eng-breakout="cfa1d47f4a8d4378a17364bb3692341b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5abfa210-3dc6-11ec-af3b-57f2067665d8" alt="Arcane"></section><p>Episode four, which will hit Netflix along with two other episodes on November 13th, fast-forwards to a time when Jinx and Vi look more like their in-game character models, and it establishes the groundwork for a future confrontation — family reunion? — between the two. Jinx and Vi are both haunted by their pasts, and their evolution is captivating. The story spins out around them, tantalizing and tense.</p><p><em>Arcane </em>might ruin me. The show quickly and effortlessly establishes connections with its characters, bolstered by an enchanting animation style and emotional, raw voice acting. It’s making me feel things, and I’m only four episodes in. The first batch of three <em>Arcane</em> episodes is on Netflix today, November 6th, while the second bunch will land on November 13th, and the final three will hit on November 20th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arcane-netflix-league-legends-review-020059350.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b9cd0c21-140f-479e-a644-5248f7f1fcad</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 07 Nov 2021 02:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636132210</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T17:10:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5aaf4e60-3dc6-11ec-afde-a0a390e44a96" width="1222" height="569" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5aaf4e60-3dc6-11ec-afde-a0a390e44a96" width="1222" height="569" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arcane]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arcane]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft OneDrive app will stop syncing with Windows 7 and 8 on March 1st, 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft is trying to nudge more people toward newer Windows versions. As <em>Thurott</em><a href="https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/microsoft-consumer-services/onedrive/259004/microsoft-to-kill-onedrive-for-windows-7-8-8-1-in-early-2022">reports</a>, Microsoft has <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-onedrive-blog/end-of-support-for-onedrive-desktop-application-on-windows-7-8/ba-p/2929066">warned</a> that the OneDrive desktop app will stop syncing with personal Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 computers on March 1st, 2022. The software will no longer receive updates from January 1st onward. You can still use the web to manually transfer files, but that&#39;s clearly a hassle if you routinely access cloud files from an older PC.</p><p>Business customers won&#39;t have much of a reprieve, either. Microsoft is tying corporate OneDrive support to the Windows cycle for relevant machines. Windows 7 and 8.1 workplace users will have until January 10th, 2023 (the end of extended support for both platforms), while Windows 8 users are already out of luck.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company wasn&#39;t shy about its reasoning. This will help &quot;focus resources&quot; on newer Windows platforms and technologies, according to OneDrive developers. In other words, Microsoft really wants you to upgrade to Windows 10 or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a>.</p><p>This isn&#39;t a completely unexpected move. Microsoft has long had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-germany-microsoft-extended-security.html">trouble persuading some customers</a> to upgrade to newer versions of Windows, to the point where companies and governments would rather pay for special support contracts than update. That hurts Microsoft&#39;s bottom line, of course, but it also poses security risks — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-15-the-wannacry-ransomware-is-a-stark-reminder-of-a-broken-system.html">WannaCry took advantage</a> of organizations running outdated Windows versions. The new OneDrive policy may push some users to install newer Windows versions even if they&#39;re otherwise happy with an old operating system.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-onedrive-windows-7-8-support-end-date-210851189.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74ba7724-4838-4ff3-babd-03c3a7dc66f2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 21:08:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636232934</ingested><modified>2021-11-06T21:09:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/034863f0-3f42-11ec-ae75-30d439f4a7f4" width="3840" height="2520" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/034863f0-3f42-11ec-ae75-30d439f4a7f4" width="3840" height="2520" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/10/06: In this photo illustration, Microsoft OneDrive logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen.

The department spent over $300,000 on two contracts in the past four months to collect data for the sake of investigations.</p><p>One contract, made official in July 2021, gave Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) investigators access to mobile app location data from Babel Street&#39;s Locate X tool. The info will help OFAC target people and enforce international sanctions, according to the contract. As you might expect, there&#39;s a concern the office is effectively circumventing Fourth Amendment search restrictions.

While it&#39;s legal to view that content, the Treasury wants Babel Street to provide &quot;available bio-metric [sic] data&quot; like addresses and marital status that may create a detailed profile.</p><p>The concern isn&#39;t just that the Treasury might be circumventing the Fourth Amendment by obtaining some data (particularly locations) without a warrant.

You might need to temper your expectations. <em>Android Authority</em><a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/">tests</a> suggest the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro doesn&#39;t come close to hitting that 30W ceiling.

While that may be a hassle if you&#39;ve been patiently waiting for a new Note, it beats having to either give up built-in S-Pen functionality or settling for a &quot;good enough&quot; optional equipment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-photos-leak-163930635.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca1955c6-0565-4835-a714-f06e98bbf738</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 16:39:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636216772</ingested><modified>2021-11-06T16:39:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/318269e0-3f1b-11ec-97d3-1085e12471b9" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/318269e0-3f1b-11ec-97d3-1085e12471b9" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Front Page Tech]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra photo leak]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra photo leak]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ICYMI: The Beats Fit Pro are an intriguing AirPods Pro alternative]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Engadget’s product reviews this week run the gamut from earbuds to e-readers. Billy Steele checked out the Beats Fit Pro and liked them for their improved fit and deeper sound. Next, a few items of note for photography enthusiasts: Steve Dent reviewed the Panasonic GH5 II to see the difference an all-new processor can make, while Mat Smith used the Sony Xperia 1 III and reported that the oblong smartphone has a slew of intriguing camera features to offer. Finally, Nathan Ingraham reviewed the Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition, which left him suitably impressed.</p><h2>The Beats Fit Pro are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-fit-pro-review-140004462.html">packed with Apple tech</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ba28f940-3e61-11ec-9ef7-09a4884e4f92" alt="Beats Fit Pro" data-uuid="bcbdaf51-767f-3eac-b149-3b8da4ab398f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Billy Steele likes the more traditional fit of the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Beat Fits Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3wohfzN">Beat Fits Pro</a> earbuds. These are the newest true wireless buds in the company’s lineup and they have a slight design update with flexible wingtips, which bend to fit more ear shapes. Billy says this element helped keep the buds in place and he hardly noticed them in his ears. In addition to the hardware refresh, the earbuds also feature active noise-cancellation (ANC), adaptive EQ and spatial audio, plus other features integrated with iOS that make them an attractive option for iPhone users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The $200 Beat Fits Pro also have an IPX4 rating, and their wingtips make them more secure during workouts. The upgrades the company made to the sound profile were immediately noticeable according to Billy, who reported a punchier bass with more depth, more room for vocals and other elements and more low-end tone. The buds have the same H1 chip found in the AirPods Pro, allowing them to access features like one-touch pairing and hands-free Siri. But the Beats Fit Pro weren’t without issue: Billy experienced a lot of accidental button presses and they don’t support wireless charging. But they still offer a good blend of features, sound and performance, making them a solid alternative to the AirPods Pro.</p><h2>The Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-signature-edition-2021-review-130037090.html">better than ever</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ebb6fa70-3e61-11ec-8fee-c52d6cecda1a" alt="Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition" data-uuid="bdd49ec4-7fa9-3516-a91e-829b5e21642c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham/Engadget</div></figure><p>Nathan Ingraham knows that an e-reader isn’t a gadget that most people upgrade often. However, a larger 6.8-inch screen, smaller bezels, 17 LED backlights, USB-C charging and 32GB of storage make for quite an update, and because of all that, Nathan calls the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition" href="https://amzn.to/3q7rtDL">Kindle Paperwhite Signature Edition</a> the best e-reader he’s ever used. Those extra LEDs emit an adjustable warm light that should reduce eye strain at night, and Nathan says this was his favorite new feature on the device. He also said the hardware changes to the bezels and screen helped to make this feel like a more premium device.</p><p>The latest Kindle can also automatically adjust the backlight to reduce nighttime eye strain, plus it has wireless charging and won’t display ads on the lock screen. Like previous versions, the Signature Edition is waterproof, can play audiobooks using Bluetooth and has a battery life that lasts weeks. But it comes in at $190, which is $50 more than the standard Kindle Paperwhite. Nathan says that for most people, the extra storage isn’t worth the extra money — unless you plan on downloading a lot of Audible titles on your e-reader.</p><h2>The Panasonic GH5 II <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-review-speed-streaming-powers-164600927.html">runs on an all-new processor</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/300d7c30-3e62-11ec-aee9-a053bc5b0187" alt="Panasonic GH5 II" data-uuid="deeed504-34d4-3746-99d8-69a98b5cdcf7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Steve Dent found a lot to like about the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Panasonic GH5 II" href="https://fave.co/3oMoxtz">Panasonic GH5 II</a>. The refreshed design still has the same 20-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor, as well as the same 3.68 million dot resolution and .76x magnification. The body hardware is nearly identical with an excellent grip, logical control positions and a smaller but brighter rear display. However, the new version of the camera has a faster processor and double the refresh rate at 120Hz. The chip helps improve the AI autofocus, which can now double the face- and eye-tracking speeds as well as pick up focus on a face tilted away from the camera.</p><p>Steve also liked the menus better on the GH5 II, which are color coded and tabbed to help you find what you’re looking for. Panasonic also kept the info panel, which shows important settings at a glance. Another upgrade comes in the image stabilization system, which now delivers up to 6.5 EV of shake protection. Thanks to this, Steve said the GH5 II does a better job than competitors at smoothing out walking or running. But there’s still no external RAW video, and low-light shooting remains a weak point.</p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-143002186.html">It&#39;s all about the cameras</a> on the Sony Xperia 1 III</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/648ea5b0-3e62-11ec-9f7f-6f0769f391aa" alt="Sony Xperia 1 II" data-uuid="f6ecd9b9-d9cc-3a49-8ba0-9986fc4c6920"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith/Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sony&#x002019;s Xperia 1 III" href="https://amzn.to/3mOu7w8">Sony’s Xperia 1 III</a> closely resembles last year&#39;s smartphone with an unusual 21:9 screen ratio and an elongated design. Mat Smith says the addition of a matte finish helps to make it feel like a premium handset. The updated 4K 120Hz screen also helps make everything look quite crisp, and it runs smoothly thanks to a Snapdragon 888 chipset, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Though Mat says the phone&#39;s 6.5-inch OLED screen is gorgeous, the Xperia can’t dynamically change refresh rates to maximize battery life — and that results in barely a full day of use, even with a 4,500mAh battery, if you keep the panel at 120Hz. He was pleased with the sound from the front-facing stereo speakers, which continues support for audio formats like 360 Reality Audio, Hi-Resolution audio and Dolby Atmos. And — shocker — the Xperia 1 III still includes a 3.5mm audio jack.</p><p>But the phone’s camera shines, courtesy of the three 12-megapixel shooters with varying focal lengths. The Xperia 1 III can track moving subjects and catch crisp shots in busy scenes because it’s capable of capturing 20 frames per second and has dual-phase-detection-autofocus pixels. Mat says it’s a more technical approach and it has a learning curve, but it makes the smartphone an intriguing prospect for photography enthusiasts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-the-beats-fit-pro-are-an-intriguing-airpods-pro-alternative-160023697.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">95efa7f5-d8bb-4a96-9a88-7e21c782e5a7</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 16:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636137402</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T18:36:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1517ef30-3b08-11ec-bebd-a5bd5f0805b4" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1517ef30-3b08-11ec-bebd-a5bd5f0805b4" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats’ latest true wireless earbuds offer all of the best features from Apple’s new AirPods in a less polarizing design.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Beats Fit Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: Domestication brought about our best fuzzy friends]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nearly 40,000 years ago, humanity had its best idea to date: transform the age&#39;s apex predator into a sociable and loyal ally. Though early humans largely muddled through the first few thousand years of the process, the results have been nothing short of revolutionary. The practice of domestication underpins our modern world, without which we wouldn&#39;t have dogs or cats or farm animals — or even farms for that matter.

The term is derived from the Latin for “dwelling” or “house”: domus. In its broadest sense, domestication is the process of rendering an animal or plant suitable for or amenable to living in the domus, for being a member of, and living intimately with, the family.</p><p>Even in this general sense, the precise meaning of domestication is elusive. Are plants domesticated? Certainly some of them are spoken of as domesticated, as needing deliberate care and cultivation, and sometimes fertilization, by humans and, conversely, as having been genetically modified through human selection to have traits considered desirable. I am not talking about the relatively recent process of genetically engineering changes to plants; these modified products, such as soybeans, are known colloquially as GMOs (genetically modified organisms). Selection has been carried out for millennia by hunters, gatherers, foragers, gardeners, farmers, and breeders of various species through old-fashioned means, not in the laboratory. If you want, for example, violets with white stripes, what do you do? You try to nurture the seeds of those that show white stripes and pull up the ones that don’t, until you always get striped ones (if you ever do).</p><p>We can understand the general principle of selecting or choosing the most desirable plants — those that yield the most food under particular conditions, for example — but the practice of selection is somewhat paradoxical. The individual plants that produce rich fruits or seeds or tubers are the ones you would most want to eat — and those are the very ones you must save for the next planting season. Which is the most practical strategy? Why did people start saving the best seed? It is an awkward conundrum. As the late Brian Hesse wisely observed in his studies of early domestication, people who are short of food, even starving, do not save food for next season or next year. They simply try to live until next week.</p><p>The habit of saving seeds for another day must have arisen in relatively good times, when food was plentiful enough to keep some for the distant future. This implies that the motivation for domestication is not to ensure a stable food supply because undertaking the initial process of domestication makes sense only if you already have enough food. Plant domestication seems to be about improving the plant species in the long run. But you really don’t care if the plant is happy to see you or plays nicely with the children.</p><p>What is more, strictly speaking, domesticated plants — crops — do not exactly live with humans or in the home. In fact, because some of them, such as nuts and fruits, grow on trees, and most require sunlight, they could not possibly live indoors. Domesticated plants certainly do not participate in family life in any active way, though their needs and locations may shape the seasonal and daily round of activities and the locations of settlements. They don’t join the family. There is an odd sort of remote intimacy between crops and those who harvest or farm them.</p><p>The more you ponder the domestication of plants, the fuzzier the concept of “domesticating” them becomes. The earliest farmers or gardeners did not know enough about the mechanics of reproduction or genetic inheritance to know how to get a particular plant to fertilize some other particular plant and produce bigger corms, or juicier fruits, or non-exploding seed heads (which are easier to harvest), or tubers that were richer in carbohydrates. Domesticating plants was not a matter of learning which individual plants were friendliest or least aggressive toward people. And yet, over time, wisdom accumulated, sometimes accompanied by good luck, and humans did find out how to alter some plants’ genetics to foster a more desirable outcome. This discovery is often spoken of as the Neolithic revolution or the dawn of agriculture. It is generally thought to have occurred around 11,000 years ago. Agriculture as an organized system of growing food transformed at least some people who had traditionally hunted, gathered, and foraged for their daily food — mobile people living off the land — and turned them into more sedentary farmers, tied to fields and villages and dwellings.</p><p>The Neolithic revolution was not a win-win proposition at the outset. Several studies have shown that early farming peoples experienced a decline in their general health because they often had monotonous diets based on a very few staple resources. Having a narrower range of staple foods meant that those people were more vulnerable to normal variations in weather, such as too much or too little rain, or too hot or too cold or too short a growing season; and of course there were plant diseases, which spread easily when a whole field is planted with a single species. Growing crops also caused humans to live in more permanent settlements, which exacerbated problems with sanitation, water supply, and human crowd diseases.</p><p>Though farming supported more people living in higher densities than hunting and foraging, it also created perfect conditions for the spread of contagious diseases and parasites and for recurrent episodes of starvation in bad years. And then there was warfare. Among nomadic foraging and hunting peoples, disputes are often settled by one group moving away from the other. But clearing and fencing fields, planting and tending crops, and building storage facilities takes a lot of work, so people begin to defend territories — or to raid others’ territories when times are bad and their own crops fail. Excess foods, such as the seeds for next year or the vegetables saved for winter, could be stolen during a raid. Abandoning a cleared or planted field and a store of food is an expensive proposition, much more risky than simply shifting your hunting to another area when game gets scarce or your brother-in-law becomes annoying.</p><p>As best we know at present, the domestication of plants began about 11,000 years ago with fig trees, emmer wheat, flax, and peas in the Near East. At about the same time, foxtail millet was domesticated in Asia. How do we know this at  all? We know it because of plant remains preserved under special conditions. Seeds can be preserved and sometimes were.</p><p>Many edible plants also contain starch grains and phytoliths, microscopic silica structures that are much more resistant to decay than leaves or stems. If found, these can also be used to identify plants that were used in the past; techniques such as radiocarbon dating can tell us when this occurred.</p><p>Historically, it was often assumed that plants were domesticated earlier than animals, but modern science shows that this idea is unquestionably mistaken. There is no logical reason why it should be true. The attributes and needs of domesticated crops differ a great deal from those of hunted or gathered foods; knowing how to raise wheat tells you little about how to look after pigs. Like fields, particularly rich hunting grounds could be invaded by others and were worth defending. But many hunters and gatherers or foragers were nomadic and lived in low densities out of necessity. Staying too long in one area depleted the local prey population. Whereas agriculturalists can store crops for the future, hunters cannot store meat for long in temperate or tropical climates, though extreme cold works well to keep meat frozen. Over time, crops are more vulnerable to theft than carcasses.</p><p>Domesticating animals involves other issues. Domestic animals are not normally hunted; indeed, they are not always confined and may be free ranging. Still, domestic animals can be moved to a new area much more easily than a planted field, a store of grain, or a pile of tubers, which simply will not get up and walk to a new locale. Such animals may even transport household goods as they are being moved. Moving domestic animals is a very different proposition from moving plant foods.</p><p>So why do we use the same word, domesticates, to describe both plant and animal species, and a single word, domestication, to describe the process by which an organism becomes domesticated? I think it is a grave mistake that has been based on outdated ideas and faulty assumptions. I do not believe that a single process is involved. I argue that plant and animal domestication are radically different because the nature of the wild species from which domestication might begin is also radically different. As well as having the inherent genetic variability that causes some individuals to exhibit more desirable traits, animals must also cooperate to some extent if they are to be domesticated. Animals choose domestication, if it is to succeed. Plants do not. Like animals, plants have to have enough genetic variability to be exploited by humans during domestication, but plants do not decide whether or not to grow for humans. Animals must decide whether or not to cooperate.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-our-oldest-companions-pat-shipman-harvard-university-press-153017333.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">73927e67-26ab-423b-b6c1-25bf8b447adc</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 15:30:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636132480</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T17:14:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0bcdf830-3ddc-11ec-bdf7-1994c184c083" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0bcdf830-3ddc-11ec-bdf7-1994c184c083" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Adria  Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mom Gray Wolf and her newborn pup sharing a tender moment, Quebec, Canada]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Touching scene of Gray Wolf mother with newborn pup]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Stranger Things' season 4 teaser hints at trouble in California (update: release info)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix is finally dribbling out more tangible details of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/stranger-things-4-teaser-netflix-162844380.html"><em>Stranger Things</em> season 4&#39;s</a> plot.

The tech giant has reportedly hired Christopher &quot;CJ&quot; Moore, who&#39;s been the director for Tesla&#39;s Autopilot Software since 2019 and who&#39;s been with the company since 2014. While Moore has yet to update his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cj-moore-56509b76/">LinkedIn page</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em> says he will also work on software at Apple and will report to Stuart Bowers. Like Moore, Bowers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-05-27-tesla-executive-hiring-spree.html">worked as Tesla&#39;s</a> head of Autopilot unit until he left in 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in May, Moore was one of the employees who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-dmv-memo-full-self-driving-171620124.html">told the California DMV</a> that Elon Musk exaggerated the automaker&#39;s full self-driving timeline. In a DMV conference call, he said Musk&#39;s statements that Level 5 automated driving is coming soon <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SelfDrivingCars/comments/n6nsmt/elons_tweet_does_not_match_engineering_reality/">didn&#39;t &quot;match engineering reality.&quot;</a> Musk has been saying that Tesla&#39;s technology will soon be able to operate with zero human intervention. At the moment, it&#39;s still only capable of Level 2 self-driving, which still requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel. Moore was called as a witness in a lawsuit over the death of a man in a 2019 Autopilot crash in Florida. The documents for that lawsuit <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/director-of-autopilot-software-christopher-cj-moore-has-left-tesla/">revealed</a> in early October that Moore had already left Tesla.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Moore and Bowers are just two of the former Tesla employees Apple had hired for its car division. Other hires include Michael Schwekutsch, who used to be Tesla&#39;s VP of Engineering and who worked on drive trains, and Steve MacManus, who was also a Tesla VP of Engineering.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-hires-tesla-director-of-autopilot-software-104848566.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f4d2d409-3bb2-4154-9bf0-2fe719251065</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 10:48:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636195750</ingested><modified>2021-11-06T10:49:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ac971fd0-0141-11ec-b7f2-907e31c9afcf" width="8256" height="4640" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ac971fd0-0141-11ec-b7f2-907e31c9afcf" width="8256" height="4640" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Apple store at IFC on August 7, 2021 in Hong Kong, China.

On Friday, the agency <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-granholm-launches-carbon-negative-earthshots-remove-gigatons-carbon-pollution"><ins>announced</ins></a> a program called <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/carbon-negative-shot"><ins>Carbon Negative Shot</ins></a>. Part of its Energy Earthshots initiative, the goal here is to foster the development of carbon capture technology that can sequester CO2 at a cost of less than $100 per ton, and can be deployed at the gigaton scale. To put that in perspective, that much carbon is equivalent to the annual emissions of approximately 250 million cars.</p><p>“By slashing the costs and accelerating the deployment of carbon dioxide removal — a crucial clean energy technology — we can take massive amounts of carbon pollution directly from the air and combat the climate crisis,” said Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “With our Carbon Negative Shot, we can help remove the greenhouse gases already warming our planet and affecting our health — positioning America as a net-zero leader and creating good-paying jobs for a transitioning clean energy workforce.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If it wasn’t clear already, the Energy Department has set an ambitious target. In September, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/worlds-largest-carbon-capture-plant-185556109.html"><ins>Orca</ins></a>, the largest direct carbon capture facility ever, opened in Iceland. The plant will capture 4,000 tons of CO2 per year at a cost of about $600 per ton for bulk purchases. Chimeworks, the company that operates Orca, aims to reduce the cost to $300 or less per ton by 2030. That’s a long way away from the Energy Department’s goal of less than $100 per ton, but sustained and substantial support and investment from the government is exactly what could make that happen.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/department-of-energy-carbon-negative-shot-204740973.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9a2148ab-340a-49c0-b185-20c3171d9e3c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 20:47:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636145263</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T20:47:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a127e760-3e77-11ec-b763-d739cf189a9f" width="4500" height="3000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a127e760-3e77-11ec-b763-d739cf189a9f" width="4500" height="3000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Todd Korol / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A Shell employee walks through the company's new Quest Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) facility in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada, October 7, 2021.

That’s something that allows young children to be more deft with their hands than even the most advanced robots available today.</p><p>But that could quickly change. A team of scientists from MIT’s <a href="https://www.csail.mit.edu/news/dexterous-robotic-hands-manipulate-thousands-objects-ease"><ins>Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory</ins></a> has developed a system that could one day give robots that same kind of dexterity. Using a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deepmind-muzero-160024950.html"><ins>model-free reinforcement</ins></a> AI algorithm, they created a simulated, anthropomorphic hand that could manipulate more than 2,000 objects. What’s more, the system didn’t need to know what it was about to pick up to find a way to move it around in its hand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8d70029ee34d4c54ba2c7244e46bc331"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HgDgIHTmokE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The system isn’t ready for real-world use just yet. To start, the team needs to transfer it to an actual robot. That might not be as much of a roadblock as you might think. At the start of the year, we saw researchers from Zhejiang University and the University of Edinburgh successfully transfer an AI reinforcement approach to their robot dog <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jueying-robot-dog-221920739.html"><ins>Jueying</ins></a>. The system allowed the robot to learn how to walk and recover from falls on its own.</p><p>As things stand, the system isn’t perfect either. It can reorient many smaller objects, including things like tennis balls and apples, with a nearly 100 percent success rate, but tools like screwdrivers and scissors present a challenge. When it comes to those types of objects, its success rate falls closer to 30 percent. Still, the potential of the system is huge. It could one day make robots better at manipulating tools and make them much more efficient at tasks like packing boxes.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-casil-robot-hand-manipulation-system-182444657.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">de0c4ce4-0338-4d5d-82bd-f04f49d66ecd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 18:24:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636136687</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T18:24:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6bc88d80-3e64-11ec-be38-cbbf3169c309" width="1622" height="1030" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6bc88d80-3e64-11ec-be38-cbbf3169c309" width="1622" height="1030" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT CASIL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AI manipulation algorithm]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AI manipulation algorithm]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[BMW pulls touchscreen features from some models amid chip shortage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/chip%20shortage/"><ins>global chip shortage</ins></a> has affected all manner of industries over the last several months.

It&#39;s a joy to watch, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dune-movie-review-cinema-hbo-max-173051367.html"><ins>especially on the big screen</ins></a>. But there&#39;s also an undersung element that ties everything together: sound design. It practically breathes life to the film — so much so that it makes <em>Dune&#39;s</em> wing-flapping ornithopter ships seem surprisingly real. The key to that magic, according to sound designers Theo Green and Mark Mangini, was a focus on capturing and using organic sounds, rather than fantastical digital creations.</p><p>Working together with <em>Dune&#39;s</em> director, Denis Villeneuve, the pair aimed to make &quot;a real-sounding science-fiction film with things we&#39;ve clearly never seen and heard before,&quot; Mangini said in an interview with Engadget.&quot;[It was] almost as if you put out a microphone and captured sounds as if those things actually existed. Everything we did ... is an outgrowth of that overarching philosophy to design a soundtrack for two hours and forty minutes that felt organic, as if we were [making] a documentary film.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fc825c2c94fc4b22a81827f28b5fde58"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eWV3Om6oHCM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>That philosophy was essential to crafting the Bene Gesserit voice, a seemingly supernatural ability that allows members of <em>Dune&#39;s</em> religious order to control others. Think of it like the Jedi mind trick (<em>Star Wars</em> owes an absolute ton to <em>Dune, </em>don&#39;t forget). But instead of a hypnotic wave of the hand, the sound of <em>Dune&#39;s</em> voice is like a simultaneous kick to the gut and punch to the face. If you were somehow dozing off while the film&#39;s hero, Paul Atreides (Timothee Chalamet), tests his budding Bene Gesserit powers, you&#39;d be easily jolted awake.</p><p>To make that otherworldly voice a reality, Green credits three elements. There&#39;s the voice actor Jean Gilpin, who he says is “brilliant” at crafting witchy and ancestral voices. The sound designers also recorded <em>Dune&#39;s</em> actors saying their lines several different ways, which they played back through a subwoofer and recorded the final output. That&#39;s an age-old technique known as &quot;worldizing,&quot; or the act of recording audio that&#39;s being played back through speakers in a physical space.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb651e0-335a-11ec-9ffd-282aebcb8788" style="height:838;width:2000;" alt="Dune" data-uuid="fdc40a1d-4113-360b-b387-2b5e053f6bbe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures</div></figure><p>The final component of the voice is the simplest: whenever a character starts to use that technique, the other sounds in the world fade away. In that early scene with Paul Atreides, we go from hearing the sounds of birds in the morning and a far-off thunderstorm to silence. That&#39;s an innately eerie effect that draws us into the interior world of the Bene Gesserit&#39;s powers: As Frank Herbert described it, they&#39;re calling on their ancestors and using advanced psychological techniques to manipulate others.</p><p>Green and Mangini went similarly old-school when designing the sound of <em>Dune&#39;s</em> ornithopter ships. They&#39;re the equivalent of helicopters in the film&#39;s universe, but they sound more like gigantic insects. To achieve that, Mangini says they combined the sounds of a large purring cat, a tent-strap flapping in high-velocity wind, and the fluttering wings of a large beetle. They weren&#39;t working from pre-existing sound libraries, either. Green had to bring a beetle into a quiet room and somehow get a decent recording.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f97d7b70-3e57-11ec-95f7-32cdcac573c1" style="height:822;width:1500;" alt="Dune Ornithopters" data-uuid="47162f18-bdbe-3649-86a0-5f4bcebb1676"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>All of that was just for the sounds of the ornithopters’ wings. To craft their propulsion system, the duo took recordings of beehives and modulated them to sound like RPMs revving up in a car&#39;s engine. The shifting of the ship&#39;s wings also came from an unlikely source: Mangini&#39;s Chevy Volt.</p><p>Once their work on <em>Dune</em> was over, the sound designers counted 3,200 new sounds that they developed for the film. Only three or four of them started out as electronic or synthetic sounds, Mangini says. That hearkens back to the way Villeneuve has approached visual effects in <em>Dune</em> and his earlier genre films: Go real whenever possible. For the sound designers, that push for authenticity also led to some inventive techniques. The gaping maw of <em>Dune&#39;s</em> enormous sandworms, for example, started out as the sound of Mangini half-swallowing a microphone.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/f97d2d50-3e57-11ec-adff-265907ac70be" style="height:844;width:1500;" alt="Dune Ornithopters" data-uuid="bb01536d-f37c-37cf-885c-2261f9145781"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Warner Bros.</div></figure><p>Green likens the use of organic sounds as a way to avoid the &quot;uncanny valley&quot; that plagues some visual effects. Our eyes know when certain things look fake, and that takes us out of the reality of the film. &quot;I think [the uncanny valley] is in sound,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s those tiny complexities and tiny nuances that you only get from an organically sourced thing that sells something as being real.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dune-sound-design-interview-170027771.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2b2d2529-8281-4a13-af23-c81771cf637c</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 17:00:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636131100</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T16:51:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb651e1-335a-11ec-be77-a230d7617e2c" width="2000" height="838" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5fb651e1-335a-11ec-be77-a230d7617e2c" width="2000" height="838" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dune]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dune]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro with MagSafe drop to $190, plus the rest of the week's best tech deals]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The first week of November brought a deluge of early Black Friday sales, many of which included some of our favorite gadgets at all-time-low prices.

There are dozens of factors to consider before pressing that big GO LIVE button on YouTube or Twitch, such as lighting, audio quality, video output and software organization — and that’s just to get on-air. If you want to succeed as a streamer, it also takes practice, charisma, luck and, of course, the proper equipment.</p><p>While we can’t help with the patience, natural talent or <a href="https://twitter.com/blackgirlgamers/status/1445797197757521921">social factors</a> that determine who becomes a streaming star, we can recommend the tools to make a channel look as professional as possible from day one.

At less than $20, this is a steal as well as a showstopper.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3mRdvTe" id="2bb3fcdb96e2427f906cb3f79fc1f1e2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy RGB mouse pad at Amazon - $20</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-game-streaming-gear-160012102.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">437939e1-e84a-3746-859f-1d699463275f</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 14:31:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636135640</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T18:07:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Elgatocamlink4K]]></category><category><![CDATA[elgato]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[Razer]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arctis1]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[RazerRipsawHD]]></category><category><![CDATA[LogitechC922HD]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fujifulm]]></category><category><![CDATA[bts2020]]></category><category><![CDATA[LogitechG433]]></category><category><![CDATA[FujifilmX-T3]]></category><category><![CDATA[news]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sony]]></category><category><![CDATA[gaming]]></category><category><![CDATA[neewer]]></category><category><![CDATA[gamestreaming]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fanatsealmagicarm]]></category><category><![CDATA[RazerKiyo]]></category><category><![CDATA[MDR-7506]]></category><category><![CDATA[Logitech]]></category><category><![CDATA[blueyeti]]></category><category><![CDATA[esportssg]]></category><category><![CDATA[steelseries]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b889f670-3e39-11ec-bf7f-75af1c762cdd" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b889f670-3e39-11ec-bf7f-75af1c762cdd" width="2000" height="1300" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Will Lipman Photography for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Game streaming gear for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide - Game streaming gear]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google’s rumored foldable Pixel might have older cameras than the Pixel 6]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After working on prototypes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-07-foldable-google-io-pixel.html"><ins>for several years</ins></a>, Google reportedly plans to release a foldable Pixel in 2022. According to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/11/04/googles-pixel-foldable-coming-in-2022-cameras-will-be-a-step-down-from-pixel-6/"><em>9to5Google&#39;s</em></a> deep dive into the current Google Camera APK, the phone is codenamed Pipit. While there aren&#39;t many concrete details about what the foldable looks like or how it functions, the APK offered some insights into the Pipit&#39;s camera setup.</p><p>Seemingly, the main camera will have the 12.2MP sensor Google used in its devices between the Pixel 3 and Pixel 5. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html"><ins>new Pixel 6 lineup</ins></a>, meanwhile, uses a 50MP GN1 camera.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Pipit (or Pixel Fold, or whatever it will actually be called) is said to use the same 12MP IMX386 ultrawide sensor as the current Pixels, as well as two front-facing 8MP IMX355 sensors. There&#39;s likely to be one of those on each side of the body so folks can take selfies whether the device is folded or unfolded.</p><p>It makes sense that the main camera might not be as powerful as the one in the Pixel 6 lineup. Those phones have<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-price-specs-release-date-170039729-170024290.html"><ins> a protruding bar on the rear</ins></a> to give the camera sensors enough room. Size is a bigger concern on a foldable than a slab-style smartphone, given it&#39;s twice as thick when its closed. So, camera sensors with a slimmer profile might be preferable for Google in this case.</p><p>Samsung has also used lesser cameras in its foldables than in the flagship S Series devices. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html"><ins>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3</ins></a>, for instance, doesn&#39;t have as powerful cameras as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-camera-samples-screen-specs-160033680.html"><ins>Galaxy S21 lineup</ins></a>.</p><p>Elsewhere, the APK includes the term “isPixel2022Foldable.&quot; That&#39;s a decent indication that Google plans to release a foldable device next year, given how Google has used similar terminology to refer to previous Pixel models.</p><p>For what it&#39;s worth, Google recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-l-tablets-foldables-170002343.html"><ins>a version of Android designed for tablets and foldables</ins></a>. The company plans to release the first public version of Android 12L next year, &quot;in time for the next wave of Android 12 tablets and foldables.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-foldable-pixel-2022-report-android-12l-141906863.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">518ef5f5-d0ab-453a-9e7a-2b7627243d66</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 05 Nov 2021 14:19:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636121948</ingested><modified>2021-11-05T14:19:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbb17ec0-351d-11ec-bfd9-5d96d5d5bd1b" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbb17ec0-351d-11ec-bfd9-5d96d5d5bd1b" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Side view of the Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro standing face to face, focusing on their camera bars.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
