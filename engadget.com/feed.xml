One of the biggest reasons was the price. I just couldn’t justify $2,000 for something so niche. But I said if the price ever fell below $1,000 I’d consider it. Well, the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fender-acoustasonic-player-telecaster-guitar-140315674.html"><ins>Acoustasonic Player Telecaster</ins></a> doesn’t quite hit that benchmark, but at $1,200 it is a lot more affordable.</p><p>Obviously, something had to give for the company to shave $800 off the price, but from a pure build quality perspective it doesn’t seem like you’re losing much. The made-in-Mexico Player Acoustasonic is nearly indistinguishable from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-22-fender-acoustasonic-telecaster-hands-on.html"><ins>made-in-America models</ins></a>. The body and neck have a similar satin finish on a combination of mahogany and spruce. And the components, from the tuners to the knobs, are exactly the same. This certainly doesn’t feel like an entry-level guitar.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/71a65ab1-5d05-11ec-9bfc-fd5e3cb0fe6d" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Fender Player Acoustasonic Telecaster" data-uuid="18d1320f-80bd-3afa-be99-7461131cdc5b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>There are some physical differences, though. The most notable being the fretboard, which was ebony on the original, but is made of rosewood here. Even so, I wouldn’t say ebony is better; it’s just a slightly different experience. The rosewood fretboard, combined with the lower action out of the box, makes the new Acoustasonic Telecaster play more like an electric than an acoustic – a stark contrast to the Jazzmaster version, in my experience.</p><p>The biggest differences here are in the electronics. Where the pricier Acoustasonics have three pickups and a five-way switch for a total of 10 different guitar sounds, the Player model has just two pickups and a three-way switch with six sound options.</p><p>The Player Acoustasonic also loses the rechargeable battery and replaces it with a standard 9V. I’ll say this: The guitar chews through 9V batteries surprisingly fast, but being able to just swap in a new one (rather than wait for it to charge) is a nice convenience.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/71a681c0-5d05-11ec-bffb-2c0821b123c6" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Fender Player Acoustasonic Telecaster" data-uuid="5ac0e60c-8e69-3cfe-bd90-31561e9af3ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Just like the other entries in the Acoustasonic series, the main controls are basic, but a little different than your typical guitar. There’s a volume knob, but the selector doesn’t <em>just</em> switch pickups (though, it does that too); it switches between pairs of “voices”, while the second knob blends between the two.</p><p>Moving from back to front, the voice pairs found on the three-way switch here are Noiseless Tele and Fat Noiseless Tele, Lo-Fi Clean and Lo-Fi Crunch, Mahogany Small Body Short Scale and Rosewood Dreadnought. What’s immediately noticeable is that there are a lot fewer acoustic simulations than on the other Acoustasonics. The two models here, the Rosewood Dreadnought and Mahogany Small Body, cover a decent amount of ground. It’s very satisfying to play a simple chord loop on the Rosewood and turn the blend knob forward to the Mahogany to play leads over it.</p><p>The two acoustic voices here are good but not as convincing as they are on the Jazzmaster Acoustasonic. I attribute that to the missing third pickup: Fishman’s Acoustasonic Enhancer. The two pickups here – Fender’s Acoustasonic Noiseless and Fishman’s Under-Saddle Transducer – do an admirable job delivering electric and piezo acoustic sounds, but they’re not quite as good at delivering the variety and nuance of the Enhancer system it seems.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/71a65ab2-5d05-11ec-8daf-8f782fa1f9e8" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Fender Player Acoustasonic Telecaster" data-uuid="11b0c4af-7b96-33ab-a672-8be8e9f293a4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>That being said, I actually prefer the electric sounds on the Telecaster to the Jazzmaster. It sounds a bit more like the guitar that inspired it to my ears, and plays better with pedals. The “Fat” Tele sound has just the right amount of bite for my taste. The “lo-fi” voices are basically just the same piezo sounds you’d find in your average acoustic / electric. That’s not a bad thing, to be clear. I love the crunch of a slightly overdriven piezo pickup. If you’re banging out Neutral Milk Hotel covers or playing along with Nirvana’s <em>Unplugged</em>, this is the setting for you.</p><p>The dreadnought and small body voices are still more convincingly acoustic than what you’d get on your average acoustic / electric. They have depth and character that your average piezo alone can’t quite match. But those two voices alone aren’t necessarily worth the premium you’re paying here.</p><p>In fact, price remains the biggest obstacle for the Acoustasonic line. $1,200 isn’t exactly cheap for a guitar. Sure, it’s better than $2,000, but even many avid players will live their entire lives never spending more than $1,000 on a guitar. A standard made-in-Mexico Player Telecaster will set you back $800, and you can pick up a decent acoustic / electric from Fender for about $400 – and arguably those two as separate instruments are more versatile than the hybrid Acoustasonic. And the value gets even muddier when you consider that the American-made Acoustasonic Telecaster is currently on sale for $1,600.</p><p>The Acoustasonic Player Telecaster remains an almost perfect couch guitar and it’s exciting to see Fender bringing its hybrid guitar tech down to a more affordable instrument. But it’s still too expensive for most.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fender-acoustasonic-player-telecaster-hybrid-guitar-hands-on-183045383.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">588b81c0-0a02-4a37-999d-fbbf05b517e3</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 18:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639504260</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T17:51:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/71a65ab2-5d05-11ec-8daf-8f782fa1f9e8" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/718b0a80-5d05-11ec-bbf6-fcc117b67932" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fender Player Acoustasonic Telecaster]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fender Player Acoustasonic Telecaster]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Android 12 Go Edition will make cheap phones faster and more efficient]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-review-material-you-privacy-controls-180010087.html"><ins>Android 12</ins></a> is making its way to more devices, Google has <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__blog.google_products_android_introducing-2Dandroid-2D12-2Dgo-2Dedition_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=iUeMNOIuPBRnHjfl_fszGq526fhBaDKweMfHkI-i9iM&amp;m=3mOOaVnA8Vqi64d8LbB-D2yrtsf1pxaW648TLLox0hPxUydSoJATECOK-YUXZ_UM&amp;s=_rhfxjyft2IzxK0XC4dKY4pVBm_wj0kVXFxXUjiBKRw&amp;e="><ins>announced Android 12 Go Edition</ins></a>.

Whether that&#39;s firmware upgrades for its hardware or feature dumps for its plugins. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-3-free-update-super-synth-vst-hands-on-163304649.html">Pigments</a>, the company&#39;s all original virtual synth (as opposed to its meticulous emulations of classic hardware), has been one of the biggest benefactors of these free updates. Today the company is launching Pigments 3.5 another significant upgrade to what I have said repeatedly is my favorite soft synth at the moment.&nbsp;</p><p>While this isn&#39;t quite as large an update as 3.0, it still brings a lot of new features to the table. One of the one most important is that Pigments 3.5 adds compatibility with Apple&#39;s M1 chips. This isn&#39;t exactly a flashy new feature, but it will make many producers very happy who have already jumped on the hype train for the latest MacBooks.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c58dc4693cc24d3db241d4099adf7a65"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aF2Sts-U8Zw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The biggest change to the synth engine itself is probably the addition of a cross modulation feature. You can use either engine one or two as the mod source and dial in results that range from subtle weirdness to full on sonic freak outs. Arturia also fleshed out its comb filter which has three new modes (LP6, BP6 and HP6) that cleans up certain frequencies excelling at plucks and bowed sounds.&nbsp;</p><p>Arturia also added a new distortion module to the effects section. While there have been options for adding dirt in Pigments before, this is a lot more versatile of an option. It has 16 different modes with built-in filtering for creating everything from the germanium fuzz of classic guitar pedals, to extreme digital wavefolding or even the soft saturation you&#39;d get from a vintage preamp.&nbsp;</p><p>And if that&#39;s not enough new sound design options for you, there are dozens of new wavetables being added too, plus over 150 new presets that show off the power of the new features.</p><p>Lastly, Arturia made some tweaks to the UI that should streamline the workflow, including one-click sample preview.&nbsp;</p><p>Pigments 3.5 is available now as a free upgrade for current owners. If you haven&#39;t picked up Pigments yet, now is a pretty good time to, since it&#39;s <a href="https://www.arturia.com/products/analog-classics/pigments/overview#en">on sale for $99</a> until January 6th. And Arturia is even including three new sound banks for free — Bass Thermal, Trap Chemical and EDM Kinetic.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arturia-pigments-free-upgrade-soft-synth-35-m1-support-161634255.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">29a066c9-fd0d-4cb1-bb4d-6751bff3b43d</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:16:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639498599</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T16:16:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/457df450-5cf8-11ec-aeb3-d1934bfe7a95" width="2847" height="1723" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/457df450-5cf8-11ec-aeb3-d1934bfe7a95" width="2847" height="1723" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arturia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arturia Pigments 3.5]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arturia Pigments 3.5]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The US Postal Service secretly tested a blockchain mobile voting system]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-seattle-area-smartphone-vote.html">Mobile voting</a> hasn&#39;t had much traction in the US, but that apparently isn&#39;t for a lack of trying. The US Postal Service has <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/12/13/usps-built-secretly-tested-mobile-voting-system-before-2020/">confirmed</a> to <em>The Washington Post</em> that it secretly developed and tested a blockchain-based mobile voting system ahead of the 2020 election. The project was purely &quot;exploratory&quot; and was abandoned in 2019 after University of Colorado researchers discovered security flaws, including the risks of impersonation, denial of service attacks and &quot;techniques&quot; that compromised privacy.</p><p>However, it might be the lack of transparency that raises the most concern. The USPS didn&#39;t coordinate with other federal agencies, and it asked the university to sign a non-disclosure deal that prevented them from naming the institution involved.

Dell said that if it incorporated all the design ideas, it could reduce a computer&#39;s carbon footprint by up to 50 percent compared to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-17-review-2020-170006738.html">current</a> laptop models.</p><p>A key feature of Concept Luna is the redesigned components and a new, more efficient layout. To start with, the motherboard is 75 percent smaller at just 5,580 square millimeters and has a 20 percent lower component count. Everything is rearranged, with the motherboard close to the top cover to expose it to a larger cooling area. It&#39;s also separated from the battery charging unit in the base, allowing better passive cooling that could eliminate the need for a fan.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7394b270-5cdf-11ec-addf-374dafe61241" style="height:991;width:1800;" alt="Dell Concept Luna recycle reuse repair" data-uuid="00550fca-7136-3867-a19a-e479a685c80d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>The extra efficiencies also reduce power requirements, allowing the designers to use a smaller battery with deep-cycle cells that offer a &quot;long charge that can be maintained across many years of use, increasing refurbishment and reuse beyond the first product life it services,&quot; Dell said.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of making the design more power efficient, Dell designers used less energy-intensive materials that are easier to recycle. The aluminum body, for instance, was processed using hydro power and a more efficient stamped construction. Dell also reduced the number of screws by tenfold, &quot;with just four needed to access internal components.&quot; That not only reduces material count, but repair time (to disassemble, repair and reassemble key components) by around 1.5 hours.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e04e5630-5ce1-11ec-af7a-7fef67ee9d65" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Dell&#39;s Concept Luna shows how future PCs could be easier to repair and recycle" data-uuid="c68353d3-805c-38ec-9df5-7ef6f1ac3cc5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>Other features include a palm rest that&#39;s easy to repair and reuse, a keyboard mechanism that can be easily separated for replacement and recycling, and a bio-based printed circuit board (PCB) made with flax fiber in the base and water-soluble polymer as glue. &quot;What&#39;s notable here is that the flax fiber replaces traditional plastic laminates... [and] the water-soluble polymer can &#39;dissolve,&#39;&quot; making for easier recycling.&nbsp;</p><p>Concept Luna is far from the first green laptop concept. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html">Framework</a>, for example, recently demonstrated an easy-to-repair laptop with features like removable ports and components that are labeled so you can repair it yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>Dell might not be the most-loved PC company in terms of <a href="https://www.bbb.org/us/tx/round-rock/profile/computer-dealers/dell-inc-0825-41453/customer-reviews">customer service</a>, but it frequently <a href="https://justcapital.com/news/these-10-companies-are-leading-on-environmental-impact-heres-why/">tops corporate charts</a> for environmentally-friendly initiatives. Creating a concept that points the way to easy-to-fix, more recyclable PCs is a solid step toward reducing plastic waste and pollution in the PC industry. Now, Dell plans to take the best ideas from Concept Luna &quot;and evaluate which have the greatest potential to scale across our product portfolio,&quot; the company wrote.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dell-project-luna-pc-easier-to-repair-and-recycle-160056898.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9e3152f-5340-441b-aa34-f7fac3c03bf7</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639489840</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T13:50:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a26ea970-5cda-11ec-9f6b-efcda509da3a" width="1800" height="1030" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/a26ea970-5cda-11ec-9f6b-efcda509da3a" width="1800" height="1030" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dell's Concept Luna shows how future PCs could be easier to repair and recycle]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dell's Concept Luna shows how future PCs could be easier to repair and recycle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo will host an indie game showcase at 12PM ET on December 15th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/nintendo"><ins>Nintendo</ins></a> is squeezing in one more indie game showcase before the end of the year.

Unfortunately, America’s decades-long love affair with performing the absolute bare minimum of basic infrastructure maintenance has left many stretches of the nation’s highway lane markers faded, damaged and obscured. A new pilot program from Honda Research Institute USA could one day help local highway and traffic departments keep a closer eye on the state of the roads in their care, using the cars travelling upon them.</p><p>The Honda Road Condition Monitoring System leverages the cameras and GPS navigation systems already found in many of today’s automobiles to monitor the real-time conditions of roads and detect potential hazards. The onboard system will evaluate each stretch of lane marker as green, yellow, grey and red. Green and yellow denote ideal or good quality lane markers, while red indicates markers in need of repair and grey means that there are no markers present at all (like on city streets or rural roads).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7cc48c26503741b28b213e3c9ff1a95b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5DhN1yCYk0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The system captures road conditions using the vehicle’s cameras and other sensors, coordinating that feed with the onboard GPS to provide exact locations of any hazards or damage and then uploads that data to a secure server. Once the data is in the cloud, local highway and transportation departments will be able to access it through a web portal to see which stretches of roadway need to be repaired or repainted most urgently.</p><p>“We regularly inspect our roadways throughout Ohio and act quickly to address any issues, like faded or damaged pavement markings, that are identified. It’s a labor-intensive process. Good pavement markings are important to the drivers of today and the vehicles of tomorrow,” Ohio Department of Transportation Director Jack Marchbanks said in a statement Monday. “We’re excited to work with Honda to improve the process.”</p><p>Honda is working with the Ohio Department of Transportation for its upcoming pilot program, which is slated to begin early next year. During that study, obviously only select Honda vehicles will be recording datam, “to help enhance the efficiency of the road maintenance operation in Ohio,” according to a Monday press release. The research institute is looking to eventually connect entire fleets of Honda and Acura vehicles, allowing them to share data via V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) networks and provide real-time updates to their ADA systems.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honda-is-piloting-a-road-monitoring-system-to-spot-faded-lane-markers-141527660.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9030d567-732b-48aa-bcc1-a68f2de71e72</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 14:15:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639421816</ingested><modified>2021-12-13T18:57:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/20520df0-5c45-11ec-bbfa-502ce2b98d3e" width="4800" height="3023" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/20520df0-5c45-11ec-bbfa-502ce2b98d3e" width="4800" height="3023" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Luis Sinco via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CALIF. - NOV. 24, 2021.

With so much of our lives driven by our devices, gadgets that help keep smartphones and tablets going will be useful to almost anyone. Anker makes some of our favorite mobile accessories and Amazon has a one-day-only sale going on that knocks <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:up to 36 percent off" href="https://amzn.to/3dSiZc6">up to 36 percent off</a> some of the company&#39;s latest devices.

The 5,000mAh battery pack will come in handy for those constantly on the go as it snaps to the back of iPhone 13s and provides up to 17 hours of additional juice. It also has a built-in kickstand, so you can prop up your iPhone while it&#39;s wirelessly charging. We also appreciate that it doesn&#39;t add much heft to the iPhone, measuring just 12.8mm thick, and that you can use it with MagSafe-compatible phone cases, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you know someone who could stand to clean up their nightstand a bit, Anker&#39;s MagGo desktop charging station could do the trick. It looks similar to Amazon&#39;s now-discontinued Echo Spot, but with a powerful magnetic pad instead of a smart display. The orb magnetically holds on to your iPhone, positioning it at an angle that makes it easy to see and use the screen. On its back, it has a bunch of ports: three AC outlets, two USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. That lets you plug in almost any other gadget you have lying around like a tablet or your smartwatch, and it keeps all of your cables mostly out of the way. Its small size and cute design make it a good choice as a catch-all charging device for your nightstand or the desk in your home office.</p><p>While the sale mostly includes magnetic accessories, there are a few standard charging gadgets included, too.

According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/california-halts-ponyais-driverless-testing-permit-after-accident-2021-12-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, the DMV suspended its driverless testing permit on November 19th, a few weeks after a reported collision in Fremont. Based on the report filed with the state&#39;s DMV, a Pony.ai vehicle operating autonomously hit a road center divider and a traffic sign on October 28th.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a single vehicle incident, and there were no injuries and other vehicles involved. As <em>Reuters</em> said, it&#39;s unclear what aspect of the accident prompted the DMV to suspend Pony.ai&#39;s permit, but the company said it immediately launched an investigation and is working with the agency to figure out what caused the collision.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Pony.ai won&#39;t be able to test fully autonomous vehicles in California anymore, it can continue its trials with safety drivers behind the wheel. The company has 10 Hyundai Motor Kona electric vehicles registered for testing and only <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/05/21/chinese-startup-pony-ai-can-now-test-driverless-vehicles-in-three-california-cities/">secured</a> its driverless testing permit six months ago for three cities in the state. It&#39;s the eighth company to receive that kind of permit in California, following the likes of Waymo, Cruise and Baidu. Under the terms of the permit, Pony.ai was given permission to conduct driverless tests in Fremont, Milpitas and Irvine on open roads and with a speed limit of 45 miles per hour. Further, the vehicles could only operate in clear weather and light precipitation.</p><p>Pony.ai recently <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211129005790/en/Pony.ai-Receives-Approval-for-Paid-Autonomous-Robotaxi-Services-in-Beijing">received</a> approval to run paid autonomous taxi services in Beijing, which it was also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/15/chinese-startup-pony-ai-plans-to-launch-a-driverless-robotaxi-service-in-california-in-2022/">hoping to achieve</a> in California by 2022. It remains to be seen whether this suspension will delay those plans considerably.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-suspends-ponyai-driverless-testing-permit-122914859.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6daaca69-fb69-4900-8613-d50ce4e9e7d7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 12:29:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639488776</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T13:33:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/32385680-5ce2-11ec-8eff-676c992f1f6d" width="1590" height="903" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/32385680-5ce2-11ec-8eff-676c992f1f6d" width="1590" height="903" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pony.ai]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A white Pony.ai autonomous vehicle is seen driving down a roadway with browning fall foliage in the background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Pony.ai autonomous vehicle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The Analogue Pocket could be the definitive retro handheld]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After teasing, delaying and just generally riling up retro gamers, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-first-look-handheld-gaming-as-good-as-it-ever-was-160050430.html">Analogue’s Pocket</a> is almost here.

The issue only applies to 2018 and later models, but recently came to light as the free trials of Toyota&#39;s Remote Connect subscription started to expire.&nbsp;</p><p>Toyota lets you start vehicles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-rav-4-prime-priced-at-40000-195446077.html">RAV 4 PHEV</a> remotely in two ways. One is over WiFi/LTE using its Remote Connect apps that cost $8 per month or $80 per year. The other is by using the key fob, which requires that you be relatively close to the vehicle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unless they read the fine print, however, owners may not have known that the key fob method was also part of the Remote Connect subscription. Toyota confirmed to <em>The Drive</em> that you&#39;ll need a paid subscription on every 2018 and newer Toyota model to use the function.</p><p>Complicating the situation is that most buyers received a free three-year or 10-year Remote Connect trial depending on whether they had the Audio Plus or Premium Audio trim options. So for at least the first three years of ownership, the remote key fob start method would have worked without a hitch — but it&#39;s now expiring for 2018 models.</p><p>The issue was originally spotted by car shopping site <a href="https://www.copilotsearch.com/posts/toyota-rav4-remote-start/"><em>CoPilot</em></a> last summer. Owners are particularly irked that Toyota has linked the key fob remote start function to Remote Connect, since the key fob doesn&#39;t require an app in any way. What might be extra galling is that the limitation doesn&#39;t apply to pre-2018 cars, because Toyota didn&#39;t want to update them from 3G to LTE networks.&nbsp;</p><p>Toyota isn&#39;t the first automaker to charge for key features on top of the price of the car. Mercedes also <a href="https://www.jdpower.com/automotive-news/mercedes-benz-eqs-rear-wheel-steer-requires-subscription">requires a subscription</a> in Europe for rear-wheel steering in its new EQS electric car. And after charging buyers a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-bmw-adds-a-80-yearly-subscription-for-apples-carplay.html">monthly fee</a> for Apple CarPlay, BMW <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-04-bmw-apple-carplay-waives-subscription-fee.html">backtracked</a> and included the feature for free.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-key-fob-remote-start-function-requires-subscription-111606852.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94790a4c-8b89-4062-b4b4-4659d6123acd</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 11:16:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639491117</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T14:13:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5b32c790-5cc5-11ec-bb2e-f8434b4749e0" width="1600" height="800" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5b32c790-5cc5-11ec-bb2e-f8434b4749e0" width="1600" height="800" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toyota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toyota's remote start key-fob function requires an $8/month subscription]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Toyota's remote start key-fob function requires an $8/month subscription]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG’s StanbyME is a wireless TV on wheels]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG is slated to showcase two lifestyle TVs with unusual designs at CES 2022, one of which is the recently announced premium <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-design-focused-oled-tv-moving-cover-131546091.html">OLED Evo TV with motorized cover</a>. The other? It&#39;s a smaller wireless TV with built-in battery called StanbyME that you can roll in and out of any room in your home. The 27-inch display is mounted on a moveable stand with concealed wheels, and you can adjust its height to customize its position for whatever you&#39;re using it for. You can also swivel and rotate its screen to either portrait or landscape orientation.&nbsp;</p><p>In its announcement, LG said that since you can adjust its position as needed, you can use it in your kitchen while cooking or in your bedroom or the sofa while lounging. And you can, unless you&#39;re planning on not getting up for hours to binge on your favorite series — the TV only lasts for three hours of viewing before it needs a recharge.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite that limitation, you can use the StanbyME to view whatever content you want using the apps it supports, which include Netflix, YouTube and Prime Video. You can also take advantage of its mobile screen mirroring capability with your Android or iOS phone and NFC. The model has a removable mobile cradle on top, so you can use it to take video calls or attend online classes. Plus, you can use it as a screen for your laptop or PC via wireless connection or by using USB or HDMI.</p><p>The model will come with a remote control you can use for navigation, but it&#39;ll also be able to recognize touch and gesture commands. LG also says that it has a unique US that&#39;s &quot;tailored to the viewer&#39;s personal viewing experience.&quot; The manufacturer didn&#39;t explain what it meant by that, but we&#39;ll find out for sure in January at CES.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/l-gs-stanbyme-wireless-tv-101519278.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">868ba710-2568-41b4-906e-1db2b7097d14</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 10:15:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639491156</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T14:14:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/23471950-5cb9-11ec-a4fe-badc55335f79" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/23471950-5cb9-11ec-a4fe-badc55335f79" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG Electronics USA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The other innovation in LGâs new Lifestyle TV lineup, LG StanbyME, is the ideal companion for todayâs TV viewing habits.

Following last year&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-x-2021-rollable-concept-phone-093038483.html">Oppo AR Glass</a> concept, the new Oppo Air Glass will become available to Chinese consumers in Q1 2022 for a yet-to-be-announced price. It&#39;ll come in two parts: a detachable monocle waveguide device (in black or white) and either a silver half frame or a black full frame. And no, you won&#39;t be able to attach this 30-gram device to your own glasses.</p><div id="f427458c2c774c029fa3ea5e5f2d84ae"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DMQUDSk_4B0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Much like Google Glass, Oppo Air Glass is designed to deliver simple information for use cases such as navigation, translation, teleprompter, calendar, weather, fitness tracking and more. Oppo calls this &quot;assisted reality,&quot; which keeps the package portable yet practical and accessible. This is achieved using a power-efficient &quot;Spark Micro Projector,&quot; which comes in at roughly the size of a single coffee bean, and it houses a Micro LED chip to project a bright 640 x 480 image onto a waveguide display — one that&#39;s larger than that of Google Glass.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b4c08b80-5cbb-11ec-bdae-82e193e172f1" alt="Oppo Air Glass" data-uuid="4337b49e-da54-36c5-b3fc-c29fe8de21a1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>Oppo Air Glass is driven by a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-spaces-ar-xr-platform-163552229.html">Qualcomm</a> Snapdragon Wear 4100, which is similar to the chip inside some of the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html">Fossil</a> and TicWatch smartwatches. Once paired with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-10-oppo-unified-android-operating-system-163038315.html">Oppo phone</a> (with ColorOS 11 or later) or an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-watch-wear-os-153021890.html">Oppo Watch</a>, you can toggle notifications by tapping the Air Glass&#39; slim touch bar or simply by nodding your head, and then tap again or shake your head to close them. To switch between apps, simply swipe the touch bar.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/ccfe7270-5cbb-11ec-b7d5-87b3d171667c" alt="Oppo Air Glass" data-uuid="20aac161-3971-3195-b09b-eefe7b5e4342"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>In the case of the teleprompter app, you can upload your speech, set your text size and scrolling speed via the smartphone app, and then tap the touch bar to scroll manually if needed.

However, only Chinese, English and Japanese are supported at the moment, with Korean to follow soon.</p><p>For the navigation app, Oppo worked with Baidu to integrate Baidu Walk &amp; Bike Navigation as well as Explore Nearby. Don&#39;t expect any sophisticated AR graphics here; users will simply see step-by-step navigation based on one&#39;s location and orientation, and voice command is supported (presumably only in Chinese).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6117c000-5cc2-11ec-bfff-b115e4db4904" alt="Oppo Air Glass" data-uuid="7849d205-bf1d-3b10-98c3-713b96577acc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>An Oppo rep added that the Air Glass is the result of two previous designs, which allowed the company to work with developers to build up an ecosystem. In addition, the Chinese company will soon release a Smart Glass SDK to let more developers — potentially those from overseas as well — into the party.</p><p>Considering how other companies such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">Meta</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-three-new-frames-131152809.html">Bose</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-frames-pacific-blue-quartz-grey-announcement-130020269.html">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snap-augmented-reality-spectacles-selfie-drone-190800775.html">Snap</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-anzu-smart-glasses-review-price-specs-available-now-162556863.html">Razer</a> have been focusing on either audio- or camera-based smartglasses, Oppo&#39;s strategy with its Air Glass is certainly a bit of a surprise. For now, this is all rather experimental for Oppo, as the device will only be launched in China in a limited quantity, with each labelled with a unique edition number on its package.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oppo-air-glass-assisted-reality-wearable-xr-ar-095617424.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06443428-820d-44be-b921-f12f0bc8bd96</guid><dc:creator>Richard Lai</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 09:56:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639491512</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T14:18:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Richard Lai]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9127b0e0-5cbb-11ec-bffa-e8af8e7cc4c0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9127b0e0-5cbb-11ec-bffa-e8af8e7cc4c0" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Oppo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oppo Air Glass]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Oppo Air Glass]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube TV may lose ESPN, ABC, FX and other Disney channels this week]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube TV has warned viewers that channels including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-22-espn-lost-two-million-subscribers.html">ABC, ESPN, FX</a> and others may disappear by 11:59 PM on December 17th if it can&#39;t come to terms with Disney over carriage fees.

We are in active conversations with them and are working hard to keep their content on YouTube TV,&quot; it said in a press release. &quot;Our ask of Disney, as with all of our partners, is to treat YouTube TV like any other TV provider — by offering us the same rates that services of a similar size pay, across Disney’s channels for as long as we carry them.

If the parties can&#39;t come to terms, some 25 channels could disappear.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-tv-may-lose-espn-abc-fx-and-other-disney-channels-this-week-090746003.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4af09304-95b1-4cfe-a109-c20b448050af</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 09:07:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639502899</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T17:28:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/68d2b520-5cb8-11ec-bffa-cf27989c0c0f" width="2560" height="1337" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/68d2b520-5cb8-11ec-bffa-cf27989c0c0f" width="2560" height="1337" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[FX]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YouTube TV may lose ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels on December 17th]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[YouTube TV may lose ESPN, ABC and other Disney channels on December 17th]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nike acquires virtual sneakers and crypto collectibles startup RTFKT]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In October, Nike filed trademark applications as part of its preparations to sell virtual sneakers and apparel, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/02/nike-is-quietly-preparing-for-the-metaverse-.html"><em>CNBC</em></a>. Now, the footwear and sports apparel giant has acquired a startup called RTFKT (pronounced &quot;artifact&quot;) that will help the company accelerate its &quot;digital transformation.&quot; RTFKT was founded in early 2020 and has since made a name for itself designing and creating what it calls &quot;Metaverse-ready sneakers and collectibles&quot; — all digital goods people pay very real money for.&nbsp;</p><p>The market for virtual goods is booming, and it&#39;s expected to continue growing as we move towards the metaverse, the future vision for the internet wherein people can interact in a virtual world with digital avatars. To that end, Nike seems to have big plans for RTFKT and its team, which will be joining the company. John Donahoe, Nike&#39;s President and CEO, said: &quot;We&#39;re acquiring a very talented team of creators with an authentic and connected brand. Our plan is to invest in the RTFKT brand, serve and grow their innovative and creative community and extend Nike’s digital footprint and capabilities.&quot; On Twitter, the startup <a href="https://twitter.com/RTFKTstudios/status/1470502806868140037">said</a> that it &quot;will continue to evolve [its] brand, innovations, products and community with Nike resources and talents.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Earlier this year, RTFKT teamed up with 18-year-old artist Fewocious to release three NFT sneakers for $3,000, $5,000 and $10,000. Within just seven minutes, over 600 people <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-and-fashion-collectors-pay-big-money-for-virtual-sneakers-11615829266">purchased</a> their own virtual pairs for a total of US$3.1 million. More recently, the startup introduced its avatar-like project called CloneX, a joint effort with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami. RTFKT calls <a href="https://clonex.rtfkt.com/">CloneX</a> its &quot;most ambitious project yet,&quot; as it marks the beginning of an ecosystem for its Metaverse-ready avatars.&nbsp;</p><div id="4c7c49f578fe43c99600de9d2bdd89c1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">RTFKT is now a part of the NIKE, Inc. family. 🌐👁‍🗨 <a href="https://t.co/5egNk9d8wA">pic.twitter.com/5egNk9d8wA</a></p>— RTFKT Studios (@RTFKTstudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/RTFKTstudios/status/1470502799498792963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nike-acquires-virtual-sneaker-crypto-collectibles-startup-rtfkt-064837247.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e1cb9dd4-6789-4bea-82e9-d7bc2ece9fd9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 06:48:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639492272</ingested><modified>2021-12-14T14:32:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Venture Capital]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1ecfb640-5c9e-11ec-bdba-52f3b192e6dd" width="1600" height="986" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/1ecfb640-5c9e-11ec-bdba-52f3b192e6dd" width="1600" height="986" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[RTFKT]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[RTFKT]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[RTFKT]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
