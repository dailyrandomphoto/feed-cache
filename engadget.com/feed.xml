Amazon has reduced the cost of the <a href="https://amzn.to/3FEtc7w"><ins>8-core GPU model</ins></a> to $1,399, down from $1,499. That’s a price that matches the previous all-time low the retailer established for Apple’s latest all-in-one computer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-8-core-24-inch-imac-all-time-low-amazon-111824240.html"><ins>back in December</ins></a>.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FEtc7w" id="3590664e245947f495f5a5235b609ba1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple iMac">Buy Apple iMac M1 at Amazon - $1,399</a><p>We like the new 24-inch iMac a lot. We awarded it a score of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-m1-review-24-inch-portable-desktop-130026556.html"><ins>89</ins></a> when we reviewed it last year. Featuring the same M1 chip that’s found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html"><ins>2020 MacBook Air</ins></a>, the 2021 iMac is fit for most computing tasks, including photo and video editing. It’s also 50 percent quieter than its Intel predecessor thanks to a more efficient thermal design. The 24-inch model also comes with an excellent 4.5K display that covers the entire DCI-P3 color gamut. Another handy upgrade is the included 1080p FaceTime camera. It makes use of AI software to enhance the color and exposure of your footage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Some of the few drawbacks to note are that the display isn’t HDR-capable and the included Magic Mouse and Keyboard aren’t for everyone. Specific to this promotion, Amazon has only discounted the green and silver models.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to save as much money as possible, Amazon has had the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Ad9uyD"><ins>base model discounted to $1249</ins></a> for a couple of weeks. That said, we think the 8-core GPU model is a better value. In addition to a more capable GPU, it comes with two extra USB-A ports (its more affordable sibling only has USB-C connectivity), Gigabit Ethernet and a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID. Those might seem like small additions, but they add a lot to the useability of the machine.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-24-inch-amazon-sale-172019869.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8159844e-a5ad-4d2a-aa6d-89c98f97dfe5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 17:20:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642438533</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T16:55:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/f4fdb100-b752-11eb-ab79-10956a28523a" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/f4fdb100-b752-11eb-ab79-10956a28523a" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iMac M1 24-inch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iMac M1 24-inch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 models are up to 15 percent off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve been waiting for a decent deal on an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a>, now might be the time to take the leap.

Revolutionaries sought to break the nation free from its past, specifically from the clutches of the Catholic church, and point France towards a more glorious and prosperous future. They did so, in part, by radically transforming their measurements of the passage of time.</p><p>Throughout the 18th century, most French folks were Catholic as that was the only religion allowed to be openly practiced in the country, and had been since the revocation of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Edict-of-Nantes"><ins>Edict of Nantes</ins></a> in 1685. As such, the nation had traditionally adhered to the 12-month Gregorian calendar — itself based on even older, sexagesimal (6-unit) divisible systems adapted from the Babylonians and Egyptians — while French clocks cycled every 60 minutes and seconds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But if there was little reason to continue using the established chronology system aside from tradition, the revolutionaries figured, why not transmute it into a more rational, scientifically-backed method, just as the revolution itself sought to bring stability and new order to French society as a whole? And what better system to interpose than that of the decimal, which already governed the nation’s weights and measures. So, while it wasn’t busy abolishing the privileges of the First and Second Estate, eliminating the church’s power to levy taxes or just <a href="https://revolution.chnm.org/d/392/"><ins>drowning nonjuring Catholic priests en masse</ins></a>, France’s neophyte post-revolution government set about reforming the realm’s calendars and clocks.</p><p>The concept of decimal time, wherein a day is broken down into multiples of 10, was first suggested more than thirty years prior when French mathematician, Jean le Rond d&#39;Alembert, <a href="http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1756.encyclopedie0311.6994586"><ins>argued</ins></a> in 1754, “It would be very desirable that all divisions, for example of the livre, the sou, the toise, the day, the hour, etc. would be from tens into tens. This division would result in much easier and more convenient calculations and would be very preferable to the arbitrary division of the livre into twenty sous, of the sou into twelve deniers, of the day into twenty-four hours, the hour into sixty minutes, etc.”</p><p>By the eve of the Revolution, <a href="https://archive.org/details/dcouvertedtalon00collgoog/page/n8/mode/2up"><ins>the idea had evolved into</ins></a> a year split into 12 months of 30 days apiece, their names inspired by crops and the prevailing weather in Paris during their occurrences. That there are 365 days in a year is an immutable fact dictated by the movement of the Earth around our local star. So, 12 months of 30 days apiece resulted in 5 days (6 in a leap year!) left over. These, the revolutionaries reserved for national holidays.</p><p>Each week was divided into 10 days, every day was split into 10 equal hours, those were split into 100 minutes, with each minute divided into 100 seconds (roughly 1.5 times longer than conventional minutes) and each second into 1000 “tierces.” Individual tierces could also be divided into 1000 even tinier units, called “quatierces.” The implementation of tierces would also lead to the creation of a new unit of length, called the “half-handbreadth,” which is the distance the twilight zone travels along the equator over the course of one tierce, and equal to one billionth of the planet’s circumference — around 4 centimeters.</p><p>Decimal time was formally adopted by <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Time_and_the_French_Revolution/y7fEHa7eHYEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1"><ins>National Convention decree in 1793</ins></a>, “The day, from midnight to midnight, is divided into ten parts, each part into ten others, and so forth until the smallest measurable portion of duration.” As such, midnight would be denoted as 00:00 while noon would be 5:00.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/adaf6f80-7572-11ec-9cf7-0e1ed884f638" style="height:471;width:473;" alt="A clock face with decimal and conventional demarcations" data-uuid="823b6058-abd4-395e-a5de-41d0f53b8430"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Public Domain</div></figure><p>At midnight of the autumn equinox on September 22nd of that year, France’s Gregorian calendar ushered in 1st Vendémiaire Year II of the French Republican calendar. From there on, every new year would begin at midnight of the Autumn equinox, as observed by the Paris Observatory.</p><p>“The new calendar was based on two principles,” a 2017 exhibition at the International Museum of Watches, <a href="https://journal.hautehorlogerie.org/en/decimal-time-the-revolution-that-never-was/"><em><ins>Looking for Noon at Five O’Clock</ins></em></a>, noted. “That the Republican year should coincide with the movement of the planets, and that it should measure time more accurately and more symmetrically by applying the decimal system wherever possible. Non-religious, it advocated a rational approach and honored the seasons and work in the fields.”</p><p>The main advantage of a decimal time system is that, since the base used to divide the time is the same as the one used to represent it, the whole time representation can be handled as a single string.</p><p>On one hand, this system offered the clear advantage that both the numerical base used to define the time and the numerical base used to divide it are the same number. For example, quick, how many seconds are there in three hours? The answer, most people will Google, is 10,800 — 60 seconds/minute x 60 minutes/hour x 3 hours. In decimal time, you simply get 30,000 — 3 hours x 10,000 seconds/hour.</p><div id="a6716291bab44ccb83415c3fea065f1e"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/KncbFme" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>However, due to an oversight in its otherwise logical design on account of gaps in astronomical knowledge, the Republican calendar struggled to properly accommodate leap years. “The four-year period, after which the addition of a day is usually necessary, is called the Franciade in memory of the revolution which, after four years of effort, led France to republican government, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Time_and_the_French_Revolution/y7fEHa7eHYEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1"><ins>National Convention decreed</ins></a>. “The fourth year of the Franciade is called Sextile.”</p><p>Problem is that leap years, if we’re counting new years by midnights on the autumnal equinox in Paris, don’t consistently happen every four years. By equinox measure, the first leap year of the Republican calendar would actually have to occur in year III while the leaps in years XV and XX would happen half a decade apart.</p><p>There were also more practical issues with swapping the nation’s chronology over to an entirely new system, like the fact that people already had perfectly good clocks which they’d have to replace, were decimal time to remain in effect. It was also wildly unpopular with the working class who would only receive one day of rest out of 10 using the Republican calendar (plus a half day on the fifth), rather than the existing Gregorian one-day-in-seven, not to mention that the ten-day week played havoc with traditional Sunday religious services, seeing as how Sunday would cease to exist.</p><p>Overall, the idea simply failed to capture public support — despite edicts demanding the creation of decimal-based clocks — and was officially suspended on April 7th, 1795. The French then took a quick crack at metric time, which similarly measured time’s passage in factors of ten but based its progression in conventional seconds (aka 1/86400th of a day). Of course all of these efforts were rendered moot when Napoleon declared himself emperor in 1804, made peace with the Vatican and reinstituted the Gregorian calendar, thereby relegating both the Republican calendar and decimal time to the dustbin of history. The lesson here being, unless <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l08mxSnz8-k"><ins>you’ve </ins><em><ins>TNG’d</ins></em><ins> yourself into a temporal loop</ins></a>, don’t try to fix what isn’t already broken, especially when it might earn you a trip to the guillotine.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/that-time-france-tried-to-make-decimal-time-a-thing-143600302.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4af922d3-5806-437d-bb2f-a9adde48ae26</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 14:36:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642190234</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T19:57:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd69be90-7572-11ec-bb7b-c715e18ce1c7" width="2000" height="1503" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd69be90-7572-11ec-bb7b-c715e18ce1c7" width="2000" height="1503" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[pjjones via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The number ten in my clockface number series.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[number ten]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon UK won't ban Visa credit cards on January 19th after all]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last November, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-stop-accepting-uk-issued-visa-credit-cards-101233882.html">notified customers</a> that it would stop accepting Visa credit cards in the UK as of January 19th, 2022, blaming the high fees Visa charges for credit card transactions.

It also offers roughly seven hours of battery life, depending on what you&#39;re doing.

However, the UK Home Office is reportedly planning an ad campaign to mobilize public opinion against end-to-end encryption using what critics called &quot;scaremongering&quot; tactics, according to a report from <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/revealed-uk-government-publicity-blitz-to-undermine-privacy-encryption-1285453/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The UK government plans to team up with charities and law enforcement agencies on a public relations blitz created by M&amp;C Saatchi advertising agency, the report states. The aim of the campaign is to relay a message that end-to-end encryption could hamper efforts to curb child exploitation online.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We have engaged M&amp;C Saatchi to bring together the many organizations who share our concerns about the impact end-to-end encryption would have on our ability to keep children safe,&quot; a Home Office spokesperson told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in a statement. The government has allocated £534,000 ($730,500) for the blitz, according to a letter sent from the Home Office in response to a freedom of information request.&nbsp;</p><p>The campaign may include elements designed to make the public &quot;uneasy,&quot; according to a slideshow designed to help it recruit non-profit coalition partners. That includes a proposed stunt with adult and child actors placed in a glass box as it fades to black. It also involves a &quot;social media activation where we ask parents to write to Mark [Zuckerberg] via their Facebook status.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>One slide noted that &quot;most of the public have never heard&quot; of end-to-end encryption, meaning they can &quot;be easily swayed&quot; on the subject. It also states that the government &quot;must not start a privacy vs safety debate.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Privacy advocates called the plans &quot;scaremongering&quot; and said that a lack of end-to-end encryption could have the opposite intended effect. &quot;Without strong encryption, children are more vulnerable online than ever. Encryption protects personal safety and national security… what the government is proposing puts everyone at risk,&quot; Internet Society&#39;s Robin Wilton told <em>Rolling Stone</em>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-government-is-reportedly-planning-ad-campaign-attacking-end-to-end-encryption-101610703.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d30437b-ffc2-4ed5-a2fa-097ad935942b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 10:16:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642418627</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T11:23:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b565ae80-777d-11ec-bdfb-ffe00afc91bf" width="3311" height="2220" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b565ae80-777d-11ec-bdfb-ffe00afc91bf" width="3311" height="2220" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Hird / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A general view shows the headquarters of Britain's Home Office in central London January 15, 2007.

The feature is designed to &quot;reduce ambient noise on phone calls when you are holding the receiver to your ear,&quot; a feature that can help make calls easier to hear.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Phone Noise Cancellation is not available on iPhone 13 models, which is why you do not see this option in [the Accessibility] settings,&quot; Apple support told one of <em>9to5Mac</em>&#39;s readers. When the reader asked for clarification, the support team confirmed that the feature is &quot;not supported.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Questions about noise cancellation came up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/rn8dkj/why_is_no_one_talking_about_apple_removing_noise/?sort=top">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253217147">Apple support pages</a> shortly after the phone went on sale, with readers noticing that it was no longer available on the Accessibility page. The feature is still available with iOS 15 on past iPhone models, but is nowhere to be found on the iPhone 13.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Noise Cancellation&quot; normally uses an iPhone&#39;s camera microphone to <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/691911/how-to-disable-phone-noise-cancellation-on-iphone/">detect and remove ambient noise</a> around you, so you can more easily hear the other person on a phone or FaceTime call — something that can be valuable for the hard of hearing. The issue only applies if you use the handset by itself without, say, Apple&#39;s AirPods noise-cancelling earphones. (It does not affect what others hear; for that, Apple introduced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wwdc-2021-event-roundup-212428441.html">Voice Isolation</a> feature with iOS 15.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Apple has yet to officially confirm that the feature has been permanently removed on iPhone 13 devices; so far, the only word about it has come indirectly from Apple Support.

The STI E-RA Concept hints at Subaru&#39;s upcoming track vehicle with 1,073HP of total power from its four Yamaha motors, extensive downforce and all-wheel drive mated to a &quot;unique&quot; torque vectoring system that maximizes grip and stability.</p><p>While the 60kWh battery is relatively small, Subaru is confident the E-RA can thrive on the track. It&#39;s hoping to set a Nürburgring lap time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds at some point in 2023. That&#39;s not as quick as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-03-vw-id-r-breaks-nurburgring-efficiency-record.html">VW&#39;s ID.R</a> (6 minutes 5 seconds), but it&#39;s comfortably ahead of road cars like Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-intrigue-at-the-nurburgring-as-tesla-unofficially-beats-porsche.html">Model S Plaid</a> (7 minutes 35 seconds).

Subaru didn&#39;t discuss under-body changes, but the upgraded Solterra has a roof spoiler, skirt spoilers and other customizations to signal its performance ambitions.</p><p>However much the E-RA represents Subaru&#39;s motorsport plans, it&#39;s also serving as a declaration of intent. Like VW&#39;s racer, it shows the company is serious about EVs and can produce high-performance cars in addition to everyday people haulers. The challenge is to translate lessons learned from concepts like this to regular vehicles. Subaru is late to EVs compared even to incumbents like VW, Mercedes and GM, and it may need to move quickly if it wants to counter the electrification efforts of its rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/subaru-sti-e-ra-concept-electric-race-car-213630682.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5f98962-82ac-4c6c-95ef-1f34416111bb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 21:36:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642368991</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T03:43:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cb17fa40-7709-11ec-a4be-a9544de38301" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cb17fa40-7709-11ec-a4be-a9544de38301" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Subaru]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Subaru STI E-RA Concept electric race car]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Subaru STI E-RA Concept electric race car]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Safari exploit can leak browser histories and Google account info]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple device users appear to be vulnerable to a significant browser privacy flaw. <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/16/safari-bug-leak-browsing-history-info/">According</a> to <em>9to5Mac</em>, FingerprintJS has <a href="https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/indexeddb-api-browser-vulnerability-safari-15/">disclosed</a> an exploit that lets attackers obtain your recent browser history, and even some Google account info, from Safari 15 across all supported platforms as well as third-party browsers on iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. The IndexedDB framework (used to store data on many browsers) is violating the &quot;same-origin&quot; policy that prevents documents and scripts from one location (such as a domain or protocol) from interacting with content from another, letting appropriately coded websites deduce Google info from signed-in users as well as histories from open tabs and windows.</p><p>The flaw only compromises the names of the databases rather than the content itself. However, this would still be enough for a malicious site owner to grab your Google username, discover your profile picture and otherwise learn more about you.

FingerprintJS said it reported the issue on November 28th, however, and that Apple hadn&#39;t yet addressed it with security patches honoring same-origin policy.

The differences would mostly come down to screens, memory and storage. The 12.7-inch Tab S8+ would carry a 120Hz, 2,800 x 1,752 AMOLED panel, one 12MP front camera, 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of expandable storage.

As <em>The Guardian</em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/16/ukraine-says-evidence-points-to-russia-being-behind-cyber-attack">reports</a>, Ukraine&#39;s digital transformation ministry has blamed Russia for the hack, accusing the country of fighting a &quot;hybrid war&quot; meant to &quot;destabilize&quot; an already tense situation and erode trust in the Ukranian government. While officials didn&#39;t elaborate on the evidence linking the attack to Russia, Microsoft shared details late Saturday that suggested a hostile nation was responsible.</p><p>The company&#39;s Threat Intelligence Center noted that the code was purely destructive malware disguised as ransomware. It had a ransom note, a Bitcoin wallet and an encrypted messaging identifier, but no recovery mechanism — in fact, it wipes the Master Boot Record (the hard drive element that tells a PC how to load the OS) and downloads malware meant solely to corrupt files.

It wasn&#39;t yet clear if there were other victims in Ukraine or beyond. However, it&#39;s safe to presume the timing of the attack is problematic regardless of the perpetrator. Ukraine and its allies have been worrying for months about signs of a looming Russian invasion, and the US on January 14th claimed Russia was planning a false flag operation that would help it justify that invasion. The cyberattack appears to be exacerbating those tensions, and may have weakened Ukraine&#39;s government infrastructure at a critical moment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ukraine-blames-russia-for-cyberattack-151210108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">915658f9-c30e-45cd-bd2d-b0034156478f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 15:12:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642345931</ingested><modified>2022-01-16T15:12:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/864b49d0-76d7-11ec-a62b-6fba360166d7" width="3840" height="2592" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/864b49d0-76d7-11ec-a62b-6fba360166d7" width="3840" height="2592" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2022/01/14: In this photo illustration, a warning message in Ukrainian, Russian and Polish languages is displayed on a smartphone screen.

As it&#39;s reportedly too easy to lose contact between the buds and their charging case, one of the earpieces either won&#39;t charge &quot;consistently&quot; or quickly drain its charge.

Researchers at Northwestern University (including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/engage-game-boy-211023869.html">battery-free Game Boy</a> creator Josiah Hester) have <a href="https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2022/01/fitbit-for-the-face-can-turn-any-face-mask-into-smart-monitoring-device/">developed</a> a &quot;FaceBit&quot; face mask sensor that can track a wide range of health data from inside an N95 mask. The magnetically-attached unit can gauge your heart rate using the subtle head movements from blood pumping, and can detect leaks or a poor fit by looking for sudden dips in mask resistance.</p><p>Those measurements, in turn, can help the sensor detect a slew of other conditions. Heart and breathing data could let you know when you&#39;re stressed and need a break. And while the sensor won&#39;t replace an N95 fit test (to verify a proper seal), it&#39;s capable enough to help you maintain that fit over the course of a long day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You might not have to charge the sensor, either. While there is a battery in the prototype, the sensor uses breathing force, heat, motion and the Sun to extend the mask&#39;s longevity to 11 days. Hester eventually wants the mask to be battery-free.</p><p>FaceBit will need to go through clinical trials and other tests before it&#39;s ready for real-world use. However, Hester&#39;s team has already <a href="https://facebit.health/">released the project</a> code and hardware to the public to help others build and verify it.  While you probably won&#39;t buy one of these for personal use, it could be crucial for hospitals eager to keep workers safe and prevent burnout over long shifts.</p><div id="24e5ecf3cc234d6b8c743235c72cf70e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0zENpI85PDA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebit-smart-face-mask-sensor-205238551.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5048bf1-a45e-4dbb-98c4-bee1b2ae6cd2</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 20:52:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642280237</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T01:58:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/16b07800-7639-11ec-b59d-12297d33e9d3" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/16b07800-7639-11ec-b59d-12297d33e9d3" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Northwestern University]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['FaceBit' smart face mask sensor]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['FaceBit' smart face mask sensor]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mac and Linux games leave Humble Bundle’s Trove after January 31st]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;re on Humble Bundle and use a Mac or a Linux computer, you may want to download all the games you can from the service&#39;s Trove before the month ends.

The Humble Trove is a catalog of over 70 DRM-free games that you can access, so long as you have a Choice subscription. A few days ago, Humble <a href="https://www.engadget.com/humble-choice-subscription-change-214917516.html">announced</a> that it&#39;s simplifying its subscription service by offering a single $12 monthly plan that gives you permanent copies of all the games for that month.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to getting access to Trove, you&#39;ll also also be able to play the Humble Games Collection with a more modern collection of titles starting in February if you subscribe. To be able to access the games in the Humble Trove and Collection, though, you will have to download the service&#39;s new app. That new app is Windows only, leaving you out completely in case you&#39;re a Mac or Linux user. Humble has already started <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/humblebundles/comments/s2iqka/if_youre_not_on_windows_bye_bye_trove/">sending users an email</a>, reminding them that they only have until January 31st to download games if they&#39;re not on Windows.

While there weren&#39;t specific examples, <em>NBC</em> pointed to Iran shooting down a Ukranian airliner in January 2020 (reportedly due to mistaking the jet for a cruise missile) and a Malaysian flight brought down by Russia-backed Ukranian separatists in July 2014.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>FedEx first applied for the laser system in October 2019.

With hindsight, we can see that astronomy was about to be turned upside down by a revolution at least as big as the one started by Galileo’s telescope. Detecting radio waves from space marks the first time in history that humanity glimpsed the vast invisible Universe, hiding beyond the narrow window of the visible spectrum. It was a momentous occasion that was all but ignored in academic astronomy circles for one very simple reason: the world of radio engineering was just too far removed from the world of astronomy. When Jansky published his initial results he attempted to bridge the divide, spending half the paper giving his readers a crash-course in astronomy (explaining how to measure the location of things in the sky, and exactly why a signal repeating every twenty-three hours and fifty-six minutes meant something interesting). But, ultimately, the two disciplines suffered from a failure to communicate. The engineers spoke a language of vacuum tubes, amplifiers and antenna voltages: incomprehensible to the scientists more used to speaking of stars, galaxies and planets. As Princeton astronomer Melvin Skellett later put it:</p><blockquote><p>The astronomers said ‘Gee that’s interesting – you mean there’s radio stuff coming from the stars?’ I said, ‘Well, that’s what it looks like’. ‘Very interesting.’ And that’s all they had to say about it. Anything from Bell Labs they had to believe, but they didn’t see any use for it or any reason to investigate further. It was so far from the way they thought of astronomy that there was no real interest.</p></blockquote><p>After Jansky had moved on to other problems, there was only one person who became interested in listening to radio waves from space. For around a decade, from the mid-1930s until the mid-1940s, Grote Reber was the only radio astronomer in the world.</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grote_Reber">Grote Reber’s</a> story is unique in all of twentieth-century science. He single-handedly developed an entire field of science, taking on the task of building equipment, conducting observations, and exploring the theory behind his discoveries. What makes him unique is that he did all of this as a complete amateur, working alone outside the scientific establishment. His job, designing electric equipment for radio broadcasts, had given him the skills to build his telescope. His fascination with the scientific literature brought him into contact with Jansky’s discovery of cosmic static, and when it became clear that no one else in the world seemed to care very much, he took it upon himself to invent the field of radio astronomy. He built his telescope in his Chicago back garden using equipment and materials available to anyone. His telescope, nearly ten metres across, was the talk of his neighbourhood (for good reason – it looks a bit like a cartoon doomsday device). His mother used it to dry her washing.</p><p>He spent years scanning the sky with his homemade machine. He observed with his telescope all night, every night, while still working his day job (apparently he would snatch a few hours of sleep in the evening after work, and again at dawn after he was finished at the telescope). When he realised he didn’t know enough physics and astronomy to understand the things he was seeing, he took courses at the local university. Over the years, his observations painted a beautiful picture of the sky as seen with radio eyes. He detected the sweep of our Milky Way, with bright spots at the galactic centre (where Jansky had picked up his star-static), and again towards the constellations Cygnus and Cassiopeia. By this time he had learned enough physics to make scientific contributions, too. He knew that if the hiss from the Milky Way was caused by thermal emission – heat radiation from stars or hot gas – then it would be stronger at shorter wavelengths. Given that Reber was picking up much shorter wavelengths than Jansky (60 cm, compared to Jansky’s fifteen-metre waves), Reber should have been bombarded with invisible radio waves tens of thousands of times more powerful than anything Jansky saw. But he wasn’t. Reber was confident enough in his equipment to conclude that whatever was making these radio waves, it had to be ‘non-thermal’ – that is, it was something different from the standard ‘hot things glow’ radiation we discussed back in chapter 2. He even proposed the (correct!) solution: that hot interstellar electrons whizzing past an ion – a positively charged atom – will get sling-shotted around like a Formula 1 car taking a tight corner. The cornering electron will emit a radio wave, and the combined effect of billions of these events is what Reber was detecting from his back garden. This only happens in clouds of hot gas. Reber was, it turns out, picking up radio waves being emitted by clouds containing new-born stars scattered throughout our Galaxy. He was, quite literally, listening to stars being born. It was a sound no human had ever heard before. To this day, radio observations are used to trace the formation of stars, from small clouds in our own Milky Way to the birth of galaxies in the most distant corners of the Universe.</p><p>In many ways, Reber’s story seems like an anachronism. The golden age of independent scientists, who could make groundbreaking discoveries working alone with homemade equipment, was hundreds of years ago. With the passing of the Victorian era, science became a complex, expensive, and above all professional business. Grote Reber is, as far as I know, the last of the amateur ‘outsider’ scientists; the last person who had no scientific training, built his own equipment in his garden, and through painstaking and meticulous work managed to change the scientific world.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-invisible-universe-matthew-bothwell-oneworld-press-163035122.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">740af94f-87c0-437d-bcc2-0b88c87e434c</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:30:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642096440</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T17:54:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d0fd3dc0-7309-11ec-bcff-3c571f222f6e" width="5300" height="2981" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d0fd3dc0-7309-11ec-bcff-3c571f222f6e" width="5300" height="2981" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Joe Sohm/Visions of America via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Owens Valley Radio Observatory, OVRO, Bishop, California.

Terms banning the employee from discussing his job with potential employers amounted to a non-compete clause and were thus illegal in the state, the judge said.</p><p>The internet company originally persuaded a judge to toss out most of the worker&#39;s claims in the belief federal law overrode California legislation. An appeals court overturned that decision, however, noting that state laws did more to protect free speech rights that included work experience. Google has declined to comment on either the verdict or any plans to appeal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The outcome wouldn&#39;t let Google employees discuss trade secrets if it was upheld. It would let people discuss work experience, though, and could make it easier for job-seekers to switch roles without fear of lawsuits. It might also provide more opportunities for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-25-google-paid-andy-rubin-90-million-misconduct-probe.html">sexual assault and harassment victims</a> to discuss their reasons for leaving a company, although California legislation has already tackled non-disclosure agreements that bar victims from talking about incidents.</p><p>&nbsp;This ruling might also have wider repercussions for California&#39;s tech sector. QH Law partner Ramsey Hanafi told the <em>Post</em> that many large tech companies have similar gag rules. Like it or not, Silicon Valley firms might have to revamp their agreements and accept that it will be easier for staff to leave or identify <a href="https://www.engadget.com/raven-software-walkout-activision-blizzard-181557930.html">toxic work cultures</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-google-non-disclosure-lawsuit-ruling-160308642.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7b774e13-f5fb-4ba9-89b5-111fc57dfa3c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 16:03:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642262589</ingested><modified>2022-01-15T16:03:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/c57342e0-bd41-11e9-bfbf-f07857c77019" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/c57342e0-bd41-11e9-bfbf-f07857c77019" width="5760" height="3840" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AMY OSBORNE via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google's main campus is seen as a sit-in to protest against Google's retaliation against workers takes place within Google's main cafeteria in Mountain View, California on May 1, 2019.

Supply chain and component shortages brought about by the pandemic may have also contributed to the delay, if <em>Reuters</em>&#39; report turns out to be true. We&#39;ll find out for sure when Tesla reveals its updated product roadmap before the month ends.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-cybertruck-production-production-2023-152051543.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a8f335c7-8db6-44c3-be19-767a734d8340</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 15:20:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642259709</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T01:58:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/f9f78fd0-0d05-11ea-8fee-431c6a6aa639" width="4800" height="2810" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/f9f78fd0-0d05-11ea-8fee-431c6a6aa639" width="4800" height="2810" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[FREDERIC J.

And for those that hate cleaning, investing in a robot vacuum with self-emptying functionality can make it so you rarely have to interact with the machine.

It&#39;s thanks to this feature that the company calls the j7 a series of &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-j-7-object-poop-detection-040152887.html">poop-detecting</a>&quot; devices because they should be able to successfully avoid a robot vacuum&#39;s arch nemesis — your pet&#39;s accidents. iRobot&#39;s Pet Owner Official Promise (or P.O.O.P. for short) ensures that you&#39;ll get a new vacuum if the robot fails to avoid a run in with poop during your first year of ownership.</p><p>Otherwise, the j7 series sits right under the s9 series in iRobot&#39;s lineup, meaning it has a number of advanced features like 10x the suction power of a standard Roomba, dual multi-surface rubber brushes and Imprint Smart Mapping, the latter of which lets you direct the vacuum to clean only certain rooms. The &quot;plus&quot; part of the j7+ refers to the clean base, or an extended part of the dock into which the vacuum will empty its debris after every job. So instead of emptying the dustbin yourself after every cleaning, you&#39;ll only have to empty the base about once every two months. Combine that with the smart controls in the iRobot mobile app and you may only have to interact with the Roomba every so often — the app lets you do things like remote start the device, set cleaning schedules and more.</p><p>The s9+ is the most advanced device that iRobot makes and it has a few differences from the j7 series. It has 40x the suction power of iRobot&#39;s standard series of vacuums and a design that helps it clean corners better. It also has a 3D sensor that helps it detect and clean around objects, although the technology is slightly different than that in the j7 series. Both are compatible with Amazon&#39;s Alexa and the Google Assistant, too, so you can control the robo-vacs with voice commands if you wish.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-roomba-j7-poop-detecting-robot-vacuum-is-250-off-right-now-150019435.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c1a6f30-d78a-43f7-bc5c-203b54585169</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 15 Jan 2022 15:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642343109</ingested><modified>2022-01-16T14:25:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/11a98c61-10d7-11ec-9f7d-d8630d5ddafa" width="2048" height="1621" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[iRobot]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot Roomba j7+]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will let dating apps in the Netherlands offer third-party payments]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is once again honoring regulations requiring it to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-allow-third-party-payments-south-korea-105542247.html">allow alternative payment options</a> in the App Store, although this one is highly specific.
