He is also a vocal supporter of unionizing the warehouse. In a conference with press Monday evening, he described what he believed were surveillance and retaliation by his employer, solely because of his support for collective bargaining efforts. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU), which has been working to represent employees at BHM1, has filed two unfair labor practice complaints with the National Labor Relations Board over the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>In a screenshot provided by the union, a letter addressed only from &quot;BHM1 Management&quot; to Isaiah claims the worker was &quot;soliciting in working areas, during working associate times.&quot; The letter concedes that these activities &quot;may have occurred during your break time&quot; but nonetheless contends that Isaiah was &quot;in violation&quot; of the company&#39;s solicitation policy.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>RWDSU, however, believes this action was itself in violation of &quot;the settlement agreement the employer recently executed with the NLRB.&quot; That <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-nlrb-deal-labor-rights-organizing-union-183602018.html">agreement</a>, which was reported late last month, pertained to several instances of Amazon impeding union activity. The union filed a separate ULP, alleging that the company or its agents &quot;created the impression Mr. Thomas was under surveillance.&quot; Amazon has been known to hold captive audience meetings meant to discourage union interest, and after one such meeting at BHM1 wherein Isaiah allegedly questioned a &quot;labor relations manager,&quot; RWDSU states in its ULP that &quot;Mr. Thomas observed the employer&#39;s agents circling his work area for no other purpose than to watch him work&quot; and later assigned him to a different area where he could be &quot;more easily observed.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While RWDSU have described the letter as a &quot;reprimand&quot; in an email to Engadget, it&#39;s unclear if it represents a formal <a href="https://gizmodo.com/on-amazon-s-time-1826570882">write-up</a>. We&#39;ve reached out for comment from Amazon.</p><p>The news comes two days after the NLRB <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nlrb-amazon-illegally-fired-union-organizer-new-york-101549596.html">ruled</a> Amazon had illegally fired another pro-union worker at its Staten Island facility. If that case doesn&#39;t go to settlement, the Board plans to issue a formal complaint against the company.</p><p>BHM1 famously became the first large Amazon facility on US soil to hold a union vote. While the vote swung heavily in favor of the cloud-and-ecommerce giant, it was challenged on procedural grounds by RWDSU. The NLRB found merit to the challenge, ruling that Amazon had, in fact, illegally <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21033629-hearing-officers-report-in-amazon-case-no-10-rc-269250">interfered</a> with the unionization vote. Ultimately the Board determined a new vote should be held. It&#39;s scheduled to take place on February 4th (though the ballot count will not begin until the end of March.)&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon is, beyond is preference for a non-unionized workforce, well known for its rate of employee attrition. Seemingly, the speed at which it churns through workers would disadvantage efforts to build a cohesive bargaining unit at BHM1. According to RWDSU, the current voter list at the facility it 6,143 people, just over half of which were present for the previous vote, which took place almost exactly one year ago.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-bessemer-retaliation-ulp-rwdsu-025525584.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">78e65fcc-83c8-4349-8820-fdb17514c71e</guid><dc:creator>Bryan Menegus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 02:55:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1643079545</ingested><modified>2022-01-25T02:59:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Bryan Menegus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/cd50b720-9e0b-11eb-bbbf-ee5153f6cb86" width="6565" height="4362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/cd50b720-9e0b-11eb-bbbf-ee5153f6cb86" width="6565" height="4362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dustin Chambers / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[People hold a banner at the Amazon facility as members of a congressional delegation arrive to show their support for workers who will vote on whether to unionize, in Bessemer, Alabama, U.S. March 5, 2021.

Manyika has spent 28 years at McKinsey, which helps companies and governments (including tech leaders) make decisions based on economic and cultural trends like those Google hopes to address.

And labor exploitation. This past weekend developer Pocketpair dropped another trailer and well… it’s not any less shocking.</p><div id="8ce2569b8066477cb5e6e82004e252a7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PcybNpsc3-E?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The new trailer puts the guns right up front, along with several “pals” that really look like knock-offs of Pokémon like Ampharos, Umbreon and Xerneas, among many other familiar faces. The back half of the new trailer also showcases the factory scene we saw last year, as well as some new disturbing images.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If that wasn’t troubling enough, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/">the Steam page is live</a>, and the game description promises you can “sell them, butcher them to eat, give them hard labor, pillage, rob and exercise complete mayhem but this is completely up to the players to make adult decisions” with the added warning, “Just don&#39;t get caught!”</p><p>There’s still no set release date for the Japanese-developed game, but the timing of this latest trailer might be because of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-trailer-battle-system-144543029.html">impending release of <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>for the Switch this week. <em>Palworld</em> promises both open-world and multiplayer, two features that Pokémon players have been requesting for ages. But time will tell if <em>Palworld</em> will scratch that itch when it comes out later this year... if it&#39;s not issued a cease-and-desist first.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/palworld-second-trailer-not-pokemon-we-swear-220536745.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b1ada4f6-f454-4707-9a3d-d664fbd5522f</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2022 22:05:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1643061886</ingested><modified>2022-01-24T22:04:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8f29a900-7d5f-11ec-93d2-9c526428e90d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/8f29a900-7d5f-11ec-93d2-9c526428e90d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Pokémon satire &#39;Palworld&#39; serves cute creatures for dinner in a new trailer]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MacBook Air M1 drops to $850 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t worry about paying full price for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air M1</a>.

As <em>9to5Google</em><a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/24/surface-duo-android-11-ota/">notes</a>, the company has finally <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/surface-duo-update-history-fe857377-c3ae-12f6-98e9-32982b5665f1">released</a> its long-promised (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-203521352.html">and late</a>) Android 11 upgrade for the dual-screen smartphone. The newer operating system is the main draw, of course, but you&#39;ll also find a host of Surface Duo-specific improvements.</p><p>You can now play Xbox Game Pass cloud titles using an on-screen controller, for a start. OneDrive also has an &quot;enhanced&quot; dual-screen interface for viewing and editing photos. There are revised app drawer and folder designs with better drag-and-drop support, while the Microsoft feed and Start widgets have received updates. You can have the Surface Duo automatically span particular apps across both screens, and set preferences for answering phone calls when the device is folded.

Once the AI Research SuperCluster (RSC) is fully built out later this year, the company believes it will be the fastest AI supercomputer on the planet, capable of &quot;performing at nearly 5 exaflops of mixed precision compute.&quot;</p><div id="06c9eb6b8c9c412e95ebeceaeb94c8ff"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZnykn1tDSE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company says RSC will help researchers develop better AI models that can learn from trillions of examples. Among other things, the models will be able to build better augmented reality tools and &quot;seamlessly analyze text, images and video together,&quot; according to Meta. Much of this work is in service of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">its vision for the metaverse</a>, in which it says AI-powered apps and products will have a key role.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We hope RSC will help us build entirely new AI systems that can, for example, power real-time voice translations to large groups of people, each speaking a different language, so they can seamlessly collaborate on a research project or play an AR game together,&quot; technical program manager Kevin Lee and software engineer Shubho Sengupta wrote <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-rsc"><ins>in a blog post</ins></a>.</p><p>RSC currently has 760 Nvidia DGX A100 systems with a total of 6,080 GPUs. Meta believes the current iteration is already among the fastest AI supercomputers on the planet. Based on early benchmarks, it claims RSC can, compared with the company&#39;s older setup, run computer vision workflows up to 20 times faster and the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library more than nine times faster.</p><p>Meta says RSC can train large-scale natural language processing models three times faster as well. As such, AI models that determine whether &quot;an action, sound or image is harmful or benign&quot; (for example, to root out hate speech) can be trained more quickly. According to the company, that research will help protect people on current services like Facebook and Instagram, as well as in the metaverse.</p><p>Along with creating the physical infrastructure and systems to run RSC, Meta said it needed to ensure there were security and privacy controls in place to protect the real-world training data it uses. It says that by using real-world data from its production systems, instead of publicly available data sets, it can more effectively put its research to use by, for instance, identifying harmful content.</p><p>This year, Meta plans to increase the number of GPUs in RSC to 16,000. It says that will boost AI training performance by more than 2.5 times. The company, which started working on the project in early 2020, wanted RSC to train AI models on data sets up to an exabyte in size (the equivalent of 36,000 years&#39; worth of high-quality video).</p><p>&quot;We expect such a step function change in compute capability to enable us not only to create more accurate AI models for our existing services, but also to enable completely new user experiences, especially in the metaverse,&quot; Lee and Sengupta wrote.</p><p>Other exascale systems are being built in the US.

The company says its new multi-gig fiber broadband will be available in more than 70 metro areas including Dallas, LA and Atlanta. Currently, AT&amp;T’s fiber broadband covers around 15 million customers across 90 markets, with the ISP looking to expand its network to reach more than 30 million customers by 2025.</p><p>While AT&amp;T’s new 5 GIG plan is almost certainly overkill for a typical household (even with a bunch of people making Zoom calls at the same time), the ongoing pandemic and shift towards working and schooling from home continues to put a strain on families with more limited internet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new 2 GIG plan is set to start at $110 per month plus tax (or $225 a month for a business fiber), while the faster 5 GIG plan will cost $180 per month (or $395 a month for businesses). Notably, AT&amp;T describes both plans as offering “symmetrical” speeds, which means customers should see equally fast download and<em>&nbsp;</em>upload speeds. That last part is important for anyone who has to move large files around, especially when a lot of older internet plans often featuring upload speeds that are significantly lower than download speeds.</p><p>In addition to its new multi-gig fiber plans, AT&amp;T is updating its fiber internet plans with more straightforward pricing. AT&amp;T says this means new customers won’t get hit with any equipment fees, data caps or annual contracts, with initial pricing locked in for at least 12 months. So your bill should just be the price of the service plus tax, with AT&amp;T throwing in perks such as its ActiveArmor internet security, speedy Wi-Fi 6 routers, and a free HBO Max subscription for customers with top-tier plans (either the gigabit, 2 GIG or 5 GIG plans).</p><p>So, while AT&amp;T’s new fiber plans aren’t cheap, they should supply ample bandwidth for data-hungry people like content creators and stream video enthusiasts.

The 4680 cell is said to boost the range of electric vehicles by over 15 percent. As <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-to-start-producing-new-Tesla-batteries-in-2023"><em><ins>Nikkei</ins></em></a> notes, that could boost the range of the Model S from 650km (404 miles or so) on a single charge to 750km (around 465 miles).</p><p>Although the battery is said to be twice as big as previous versions, it has a fivefold increase in energy capacity, according to <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Panasonic-to-start-producing-new-Tesla-batteries-in-2023"><em>Nikkei</em></a>. As such, cars need fewer of the batteries, which are already 10 to 20 percent cheaper to produce. It&#39;s estimated that batteries account for 30 percent of the cost of EVs. A cost reduction could make EVs more affordable and hasten the transition to electric vehicles. What&#39;s more, a longer range means drivers won&#39;t need to charge batteries as often.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Panasonic, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-sold-tesla-shares-to-raise-cash-for-acquisition-103525121.html"><ins>a long-time partner of Tesla,</ins></a> is reportedly investing around 80 billion yen ($704 million) on new equipment to produce the 4680. It&#39;s said to be expanding an existing plant in Japan and making the batteries there to begin with. <em>Nikkei </em>reports the company will start making the cells on a small scale this year to develop safe and efficient processes before entering mass production in 2023. It may mass produce the batteries in other countries later.</p><p>The company confirmed to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/panasonic-invest-700-million-produce-new-batteries-evs-nikkei-2022-01-24/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a> that it was setting up a test production line in 2022, though didn&#39;t say when it will start making the batteries at a larger scale. &quot;We are studying various options for mass production,&quot; it said.</p><p>Panasonic started working on the cell following a request from Tesla.

It has a spacious 10-inch HD touchscreen on which you can do things like take a Zoom call, watch YouTube or Netflix and control all of the smart lights, thermostats and other gadgets in your home.

It enables Face Match, which is similar to Google&#39;s Voice Match feature in that it recognizes who&#39;s using the device so it can display information relevant to you including calendar alerts, messages and more. If you have more than one person in the house using the Hub Max, this feature will come in handy. The Hub Max also supports gesture controls, which allow you to do things like raise a palm to the camera to pause a video or song that&#39;s playing.</p><p>While it takes up more space on a countertop than a Nest Cam, the Nest Hub Max can act as one in your home, too. You can use the Nest Cam app to pull up the feed from the device&#39;s built-in camera, letting you keep watch over your home when you&#39;re away.

Per a tweet spotted by <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-europe-prices-leak/"><em>Android Police</em></a> from <em>WinFuture’s</em><a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1484689280425414661?s=20">Roland Quandt</a>, European pricing for the Galaxy S22 series will start at €849 (roughly $1,018), with the base models of the Galaxy S22 Plus and Ultra slated to cost €1,049 ($1,188) and €1,249 ($1,414), respectively. Effectively, this means in 2022 Samsung’s Galaxy S lineup will cost just as much as it did in 2021. What’s more, Quandt’s tweet suggests the company will continue its practice of charging a €50 premium for a storage bump on the standard and Plus models.</p><div id="98ce939bd95744ba83b7f447d5a6f52f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whoever said S22 series was to be cheaper, didn&#39;t think of Covid, parts shortages and inflation.<br><br>Actual official EURO prices:<br>S22 8/128GB = 849<br>S22 8/256GB = 899<br>S22+ 8/128GB = 1049<br>S22+ 8/256GB = 1099<br>S22 Ultra 8/128GB = 1249<br>S22 Ultra 12/256GB = 1349<br>S22 Ultra 12/512GB = 1449 <a href="https://t.co/QRnfrhkzTz">pic.twitter.com/QRnfrhkzTz</a></p>— Roland Quandt (@rquandt) <a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1484689280425414661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 22, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>What may change is that Samsung could tweak the base model Ultra variant to offer less value than its predecessor. In Europe at least, the €1249 Galaxy S22 Ultra will ship with 8GB of RAM, according to Quandt, and cost the same amount as money as the entry-level Galaxy S21 Ultra, which features 12GB of RAM. Consumers in Europe will reportedly need to pay a €100 premium to get the S22 Ultra with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. It’s not clear if Samsung will implement the same pricing strategy in the US. As <em>Android Police </em>points out, a <a href="https://twitter.com/chunvn8888/status/1480953702177406979">separate leak</a> earlier this month suggested the company could charge an extra $100 stateside for every model in the Galaxy S22 lineup. As always, we’ll have to wait until the company shares official pricing information before we know just how much it will cost to own the latest Galaxy S phones.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-base-model-pricing-leak-224247167.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">603d2b77-1960-4df2-8a84-8b84a6737cd2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 22:42:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1643014267</ingested><modified>2022-01-24T08:51:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/363cb2a0-7c9d-11ec-bedf-ccd8cc7a4a95" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/363cb2a0-7c9d-11ec-bedf-ccd8cc7a4a95" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Evan Blass]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Galaxy S22 Ultra]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Galaxy S22 Ultra]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[PlatinumGames’ long-awaited shoot ’em up ‘Sol Cresta’ arrives February 22nd]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PlatinumGames will release <a href="https://www.engadget.com/platinumgames-sol-cresta-182819964.html"><em><ins>Sol Cresta</ins></em></a> on February 22nd, the studio <a href="https://twitter.com/platinumgames/status/1485130371398209536?s=20">announced this weekend</a>.

In a <a href="https://cdn.hcourt.gov.au/assets/cases/06-Melbourne/m86-2021/Google-App.pdf"><ins>filing</ins></a> the search giant made on Friday, Google claims it will be forced to “act as censor” if the country’s highest court doesn’t overturn a decision that awarded a lawyer $40,000 in defamation damages for an article the company had linked to through its search engine, reports <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/24/google-warns-of-devastating-impact-if-court-ruling-on-defamatory-hyperlinks-not-overturned"><em><ins>The Guardian</ins></em></a>.</p><p>In 2016, George Defteros, a Victoria state lawyer whose past client list included individuals implicated in Melbourne&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_gangland_killings"><ins>notorious gangland killings</ins></a>, contacted Google to ask the company to remove a 2004 article from <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/gangland-lawyer-wins-40k-in-google-suit-20200430-p54onz.html"><em><ins>The Age</ins></em></a>. The piece featured reporting on murder charges prosecutors filed against Defteros related to the death of three men. Those charges were later dropped in 2005. The company refused to remove the article from its search results as it viewed the publication as a reputable source.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The matter eventually went to court with Defteros <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/30/melbourne-gangland-lawyer-george-defteros-wins-defamation-case-against-google">successfully arguing</a> the article and Google’s search results had defamed him. The judge who oversaw the case ruled <em>The Age’s </em>reporting had implied Defteros had been cozy with Melbourne’s criminal underground. The Victorian Court of Appeals subsequently rejected a bid by Google to overturn the ruling.</p><p>From Google’s perspective, at issue here is one of the fundamental building blocks of the internet. “A hyperlink is not, in and of itself, the communication of that to which it links,” the company contends in its submission to the High Court. If the 2020 judgment is left to stand, Google claims it will make it “liable as the publisher of any matter published on the web to which its search results provide a hyperlink,” including news stories that come from reputable sources. In its defense, the company points to a <a href="https://globalfreedomofexpression.columbia.edu/cases/crookes-v-newton/"><ins>2011 ruling</ins></a> from the Supreme Court of Canada that held a hyperlink by itself is never a publication of defamatory material.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Google for comment.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-australia-high-court-appeal-194529237.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c44dd01d-a900-4250-929b-def1a3bbfeb4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 19:45:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642967130</ingested><modified>2022-01-23T19:45:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/de23acd0-0b84-11ea-9b76-9559e1097c73" width="3970" height="2703" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/de23acd0-0b84-11ea-9b76-9559e1097c73" width="3970" height="2703" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Reuters Staff / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A sign is pictured outs a Google offcie near the company's headquarters in Mountain View, California, U.S., May 8, 2019.

Per a post spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/22/22896666/whatsapp-android-to-ios-transfer-feature-rumor"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-messenger-beta-for-ios-22-2-74-whats-new/"><em><ins>WABetaInfo</ins></em></a> found evidence in the latest WhatsApp iOS beta release of a feature that lets you migrate your chat history from Android to iOS. The discovery builds on an earlier one the outlet <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-20-11-whats-new/"><ins>made in September</ins></a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dd930030-7c71-11ec-8d57-da6b6425e02d" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="WhatsApp" data-uuid="8c0b0948-21d3-3e25-ac7c-1c134401073f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">WABetaInfo</div></figure><p>Screenshots shared by <em>WABetaInfo </em>suggest the app will ask for your permission before it starts migrating your chat history. We also know from the earlier leak you’ll need to use Apple’s <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios"><ins>Move to iOS app</ins></a> as part of the transfer process. On Android, that same process can be convoluted, as you need a Lightning to USB-C cable and phone that’s either brand new or has been recently factory reset.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In a <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-managing-two-step-verification/"><ins>separate article</ins></a><em>WABetaInfo </em>published over the weekend, the website found that WhatsApp is also working on a two-step verification feature for its desktop and web clients. Should the company move forward with a release, the tool will allow you to add a personal pin to your account. In that way, anytime you want to access WhatsApp either through your computer or online, you’ll need to input that passcode, as well as the six-digit pin WhatsApp sends to your phone, to do so. That’s something that will help protect you from SIM swap attacks.</p><p>It’s unclear when the company plans to release either feature. A month before the migration one launched on Samsung devices, WhatsApp head Will Cathcart <a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1425477943606747147?s=20"><ins>said</ins></a> it would arrive on iOS phones “soon.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-ios-migration-feature-wabetainfo-174005658.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b74da31-4c33-43b9-b236-7691fd7fe681</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 17:40:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642959607</ingested><modified>2022-01-24T04:02:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ba4a0e80-0ccc-11ec-87ae-c41cd6f49958" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ba4a0e80-0ccc-11ec-87ae-c41cd6f49958" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Billions' is the latest TV show to create a PR problem for Peloton]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains spoilers for the sixth season of &#39;Billions.&#39;</em></p><p>Peloton can&#39;t quite escape the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sex-and-the-city-peloton-bike-scene-152028623.html">publicity headaches</a> from TV shows featuring its products. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/arts/television/billions-peloton-premiere.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/23/22895860/peloton-billions-heart-attack-mr-big-showtime-tv"><em>The Verge</em></a>, the premiere episode of <em>Billions</em> season six includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQdhtNHcOjQ&amp;t=360s">a scene</a> that, like the <em>Sex and the City</em> follow-up <em>And Just Like That</em>, paints Peloton&#39;s Bike in a less-than-flattering light — if not quite as dire as before.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The scene depicts Mike &quot;Wags&quot; Wagner (played by David Costabile) having a heart attack while riding his Peloton spin bike. Unlike the <em>And Just Like That</em> scene, however, Wagner survives — he even references the <em>AJLT</em> scene, telling staff that he&#39;s &quot;not going out&quot; like that character. <em>Billions</em>&#39; executive producers told <em>The Times</em> the moment was filmed in spring 2021, months before <em>AJLT</em>&#39;s debut, and that the team overdubbed the reference to the other show in postproduction to reflect &quot;what Wags would say.&quot;</p><p>Peloton stressed in a statement to Engadget that it hadn&#39;t provided the Bike or otherwise greenlit the use of its brand for <em>Billions</em>. It even celebrated parts of the episode, noting that the show highlighted the &quot;strong benefits&quot; of a cardio workout. When the <em>AJLT</em> scene caused a panic, Peloton faulted the character&#39;s lifestyle and suggested the bike at least delayed the inevitable. It went on to create a promo to defend its products in response, although it pulled that ad soon after when the focus of the promo, actor Chris Noth, faced accusations of sexual assault.</p><p>The <em>Billions</em> scene isn&#39;t the biggest PR crisis Peloton has faced lately. The company&#39;s stock price plunged after a (since-denied) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-tread-production-paused-190538247.html">claim it halted production</a> due to slowing sales. However, it does illustrate Peloton&#39;s odd position. While its fitness gear is still considered iconic, the company is no longer quite so revered by shoppers or the entertainment business.</p><p>You can read Peloton&#39;s full statement below.</p><blockquote><p>We get why these fictional TV shows would want to include a brand that people love to talk about, but Showtime&#39;s use of Peloton&#39;s Bike+ and reference to a Peloton Instructor was not a brand, product, or instructor placement, and we did not agree for our brand and IP to be used on this show or provide any equipment. As referenced by the show itself, there are strong benefits of cardio-vascular exercise to help people lead long, happy lives.</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/billions-peloton-scene-171753484.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d55e8246-318c-4bd6-ba22-90672b88a63c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 17:17:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642975791</ingested><modified>2022-01-23T22:10:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/47a86a80-7c6a-11ec-ac5b-9e1ccdbde712" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/47a86a80-7c6a-11ec-ac5b-9e1ccdbde712" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jeff Neumann/Showtime]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mike 'Wags' Wagner (David Costabile) in season 6 of 'Billions']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mike 'Wags' Wagner (David Costabile) in season 6 of 'Billions']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Workers at Activision Blizzard’s Raven Software end strike action following union push]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Having announced plans recently to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-union-raven-software-communication-workers-of-america-174723576.html"><ins>form the first labor union within</ins></a> a North American AAA game developer, workers at Raven Software are ending their weeks-long strike action against publisher Activision Blizzard. &quot;Pending the recognition of our union, the Raven QA strike has ended,” Activision Blizzard worker advocacy group ABetterABK <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1485043916877488130?s=20"><ins>said on Saturday in a tweet</ins></a> spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2022-01-23-raven-software-ends-strike-action-in-light-of-unionisation"><em><ins>Eurogamer</ins></em></a>. “Unused strike funds are being stored for future organizing [and] strike efforts.”</p><div id="418f1c730e6f46f6945749fc6de0d0c5"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pending the recognition of our union, the Raven QA strike has ended.

Raven is one of the developers that supports Activision’s Call of Duty franchise, and its QA team is specifically responsible for bugs and other technical issues in <em>Warzone</em>. When the action began, it had no planned end date, a first for the walkouts at Activision Blizzard. The publisher had reportedly <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1483491941333360644"><ins>declined</ins></a> to meet with the striking workers, despite mounting pressure from <em>Warzone’s </em>community over the game’s current state.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On Friday, the 34 workers who said they plan to unionize with the Communication Workers of America (CWA) asked Activision Blizzard to recognize their group, the Game Workers Alliance, voluntarily. The company has until January 25th to respond to the workers. &quot;Activision Blizzard is carefully reviewing the request for voluntary recognition from the CWA, which seeks to organize around three dozen of the company’s nearly 10,000 employees,&quot; the company said on Friday.</p><p>If the company fails to respond to the group, it will file for a union election through the National Relations Broad. Since the collective has a supermajority of votes, with 78 percent of the 34-person unit supporting the action, they can form a union without voluntary recognition from Activision Blizzard.</p><p>News of the union drive at Raven comes in the same week that Microsoft announced its intent to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html"><ins>buy Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion</ins></a>. Pending regulatory approval, the company expects the deal, which could have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-consolidation-exclusives-222028443.html">far-reaching ramifications</a> for the gaming industry, to close in June 2023.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/raven-software-end-strike-action-161117591.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5cf48e1e-17a1-4a9c-a03c-f527c6827c67</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 16:11:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642954278</ingested><modified>2022-01-24T01:46:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Strikes]]></category><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/9f43b450-8bb4-11ea-b7ff-a5c651570d90" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-05/9f43b450-8bb4-11ea-b7ff-a5c651570d90" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Infinity Ward]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Call of Duty: Warzone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Dark Souls 3' security hole lets attackers hijack your PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You might not want to play a <em>Dark Souls</em> game online for a while — not that you necessarily can.

Streamers like The_Grim_Sleeper have <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/the__grim__sleeper/clip/GlamorousDarlingEggnogBudStar-t7dxGTY8KFWVHkL4">learned</a> about the potential damage first-hand — in his case, the intruder launched Microsoft PowerShell and ran a text-to-speech script blasting him for his gameplay.</p><p>The exploiter might not have malicious intent. <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/524597731121954816/934488192575500318/unknown.png">A post</a> on the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/81303778900316160/524597731121954816">SpeedSouls</a> Discord claimed the hacker was trying to warn developer FromSoftware about the <em>Dark Souls 3</em> vulnerability, but turned to compromising streamers to highlight the problem. Few people beyond the perpetrator are aware of how to use it, but there&#39;s already a patch for the unofficial Blue Sentinel anti-cheat tool.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>FromSoftware and its publisher Bandai Namco have since responded to the exploit. They&#39;ve temporarily <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1485210967009071108">shut down</a> the player-versus-player servers for <em>Dark Souls 3</em> and its predecessors while the security team investigates the flaws. It&#39;s not certain when the servers will go back online, but From and Bandai clearly won&#39;t restore service until they&#39;re reasonably confident players are safe. More sinister attackers could use the flaw to steal sensitive information, ruin gamers&#39; systems and otherwise do serious damage.</p><div id="53245ffc8ad84832b67d86b7847529a9"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">PvP servers for Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls: Remastered have been temporarily deactivated to allow the team to investigate recent reports of an issue with online services. <br>Servers for Dark Souls: PtDE will join them shortly.<br><br>We apologize for this inconvenience.</p>— Dark Souls (@DarkSoulsGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1485210967009071108?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dark-souls-3-security-exploit-hack-152505550.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">02d3f017-085a-423d-9770-ec2527dccd88</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 15:25:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642951506</ingested><modified>2022-01-24T01:46:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5a0909e0-7c5c-11ec-a79f-c2114d050d43" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5a0909e0-7c5c-11ec-a79f-c2114d050d43" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[FromSoftware/Bandai Namco]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Dark Souls 3' boss fight]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Dark Souls 3' boss fight]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
