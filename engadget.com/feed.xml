Christine works for Blizzard, the group responsible for games including Overwatch and Diablo, and she stood outside the studio&#39;s headquarters in Irvine, California, with her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, by her side.&nbsp;</p><p>Through tears, Christine said she experienced years of sexual harassment at Blizzard, even though it had started out as her &quot;dream job.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;I was so excited to be a part of a community that seemed to care so much about their employees,&quot; Christine said. &quot;Unfortunately, that didn&#39;t happen to me. Since I&#39;ve been employed at Blizzard, I&#39;ve been subjected to rude comments about my body, unwanted sexual advances, inappropriately touched, subjected to alcohol-infused team events and cube crawls, invited to have casual sex with my supervisors, and surrounded by a frat-boy culture that&#39;s detrimental to women.&quot;</p><p>Christine said she brought these negative experiences to her supervisors and they were brushed aside. According to her statement, her superiors said the men harassing her were &quot;just joking&quot; and that she should &quot;get over it.&quot; She was told not to go to HR. She was told her abusers had done nothing wrong in the eyes of the law.</p><p>Christine said that after she complained about the sexual abuse she was experiencing, she was demoted and faced retaliation. She said she was denied shares in the company and full profit-sharing, and she received minimal raises.</p><p>In her statement, Christine said her mental health was shattered by these events, but she was going public in order to fight for a safe work environment for all Activision Blizzard employees.</p><p>&quot;Blizzard has some amazing people that work for them, but we need to feel safe and supported by people in leadership roles, and hold people accountable for their actions,&quot; she said.</p><p>Activision Blizzard is facing multiple investigations and lawsuits regarding its alleged frat-boy culture. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing is suing the studio after an investigation uncovered years of discriminatory hiring practices, a systemic failure to treat sexual harassment seriously, and a culture that encouraged abuse. The result, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-discrimination-abuse-video-163056567.html">according to the DFEH report</a>, was a studio where just 20 percent of employees were women, and leadership roles were held only by white men.</p><div id="59bef0775e084ab1be8831373bb64b6a"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/we5QWDLHwXE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Lisa Bloom, Christine&#39;s lawyer, made a statement of her own after the employee spoke.</p><p>&quot;We are here because sexual harassment victims at Activision Blizzard have been ignored,&quot; Bloom said. &quot;They are still suffering and it&#39;s time that they are prioritized.&quot;</p><p>Following an investigation by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission earlier this year, Activision Blizzard was ordered to establish an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-settles-eeoc-18-million-lawsuit-005806200.html">$18 million fund</a> to compensate victims of sexual harassment and gender discrimination at the studio. Bloom argued that this amount is far too low, considering there are hundreds of victims. She also pointed out that Activision Blizzard has already missed critical deadlines when it comes to distributing this money.</p><p>&quot;I think we can all agree that the $18 million number is woefully inadequate,&quot; Bloom said.</p><p>Bloom then outlined three demands. She first said Activision Blizzard should establish a streamlined, fair and fast process for all victims to resolve their legal claims, and asked for a fund exceeding $100 million. Second, Bloom said the studio should deliver a real apology to Christine and the other victims, and third, she demanded a review by a neutral third party of the career damage employees like Christine have endured, with the goal of remedying any discriminatory decisions.</p><p>Bloom has ample experience in this legal arena, most recently representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein.</p><div id="ffa454670ad44f96a21be05b87136940"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JMof6sI_fks?rel=0&amp;start=4232" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Activision Blizzard employees have staged a handful of walkouts in protest of the studio&#39;s response to these allegations, which has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employee-open-letter-221223475.html">dismissive </a>and <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/blizzard-boss-jen-oneal-was-paid-less-than-her-male-counterpart-prior-to-resigning/">generally terrible</a>.

We&#39;ve seen a slew of disaster response bots — some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-08-the-machines-that-rose-to-darpas-robotics-challenge.html">humanoid</a>, some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/carnegie-mellon-snake-robot-swims-181159998.html">not so much</a> — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-19-darpas-insect-sized-shrimp-robots-disaster-relief.html">emerge from labs</a> for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-03-04-researchers-develop-flying-wifi-robots-for-disaster-relief.html">more than a decade</a>, often with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-06-08-the-machines-that-rose-to-darpas-robotics-challenge.html">varying degrees of success</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="c6024084680b4162becaa7ba0e696be6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g0TaYhjpOfo?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Humanoid robots have an advantage over both more esoteric builds and traditional UAVs when it comes to disaster response because they can more easily manipulate a world, which is already designed for human use. However when a natural disaster strikes, much of that human-centric infrastructure could become damaged or otherwise rendered impassable, which negates many of the humanoid robot&#39;s initial advantages. But by combining a humanoid design with the capability of flight, Pucci&#39;s team can leverage the best aspects of both technologies.</p><p>&quot;Aerial Humanoid Robotics unifies aerial manipulation and humanoid robotics. By doing so, aerial humanoid robots overcome the lack of terrestrial locomotion of aerial manipulators and extend the locomotion capabilities of humanoid robots to the flight case. Aerial humanoid robots can then walk, fly, manipulate and transport objects, thus offering energetically efficient solutions to payload transportation and object manipulation,&quot; <a href="https://ieee-aerialrobotics-uavs.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ICRA2019_AerialRoboticsWorkshop_paper_Pucci.pdf">the IIT team wrote in 2019</a>.</p><div id="a7403dcb4b4d4d9c99810a3984a39a5f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hBEYEF0g4WY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>&quot;Aerial humanoid robotics extends aerial manipulation to a more robust and energy efficient level. In fact, aerial manipulation is often exemplified by quadrotors equipped with a robotic arm,&quot; Pucci told <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/flying-humanoid-robot"><em>IEEE Spectrum</em></a><em>.</em> &quot;These robots can’t move around by means of contact forces with the environment, and they often struggle with flying in windy environments while manipulating an object, requiring precise position control for accomplishing manipulation tasks. So the extra hand of a flying humanoid robot could establish a contact point between the robot and the environment, thus making the robot position control simpler and more robust.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I truly believe that aerial humanoid robotics can be used as a test-bed for actuated flying exoskeletons for human beings,&quot; he continued. &quot;The recent successful story of Richard Browning shows the engineering feasibility of these futuristic actuated exoskeletons. However, the journey in front of us is still long, and we can use flying humanoid robots to boost this journey and avoid lots of tests on humans.&quot;</p><p>Pucci&#39;s most recent study, <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9622189"><em>Momentum-Based Extended Kalman Filter for Thrust Estimation on Flying Multibody Robots</em></a>, is slated for publication in the January issue of <em>IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/italian-researchers-have-built-a-humanoid-robot-that-may-one-day-fly-like-iron-man-192750759.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4a44e215-1a15-4ca1-b2b8-dfd61b153f82</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 19:27:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638993555</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T19:59:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/60c3d330-585a-11ec-b7fe-107d7a4abd05" width="1580" height="1185" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/43792c60-5852-11ec-86f9-ce870507a0c0" width="2880" height="1576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instituto Italiano di Technologia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iRonCub as iRonMan]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRonCub as iRonMan]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Horizon Zero Dawn' now supports NVIDIA and AMD upscaling on PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Guerrilla Games has rolled out the latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Horizon%20Zero%20Dawn/"><em><ins>Horizon Zero Dawn</ins></em></a> update on PC, which should improve the game&#39;s performance.

However, you’ll still need to check in at the front desk before you can use your iPhone or Apple Watch to enter your guestroom or any other restricted area within the hotel.

What’s more, if your device starts running low on battery life and enters Power Reserve mode, you can still use your iPhone or Apple Watch as a keycard for up to five hours.</p><p>The six locations where you can use your iPhone or Apple Watch to store a keycard are as follows: Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort, Hyatt Centric Key West Resort and Spa, Hyatt House Chicago/West Loop-Fulton Market, Hyatt House Dallas/Richardson, Hyatt Place Fremont/Silicon Valley and Hyatt Regency Long Beach.</p><p>Hyatt says it expects to roll out the technology to all of its locations globally. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-digital-id-delay-195046762.html">Sometime next year</a>, Apple also plans to allow iOS 15 and watchOS 8 to store government issued IDs from select states as well.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-hotel-keycards-hyatt-launch-190013202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9cf0798a-0b23-4144-aec8-c82207f5eeb4</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 19:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638992106</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T19:35:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5d0536d0-5855-11ec-bbe4-0bcb4305d433" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5d0536d0-5855-11ec-bbe4-0bcb4305d433" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hyatt Hotels Corporation]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Wallet hotel keys]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Wallet hotel keys]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ford Bronco Sport contains trace amounts of recycled ocean plastic]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many car brands are <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-polestar-2-is-a-sporty-ev-fastback-with-allnew-android-automotive-140040133.html">touting recycled parts</a> in their vehicles, but Ford thinks it can claim some extra bragging rights.

It recently started making F-250 fuel-line clips <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-hp-3d-injection-molded-part-3d-printer-waste-204612676.html">from 3D printer waste</a>, and used water bottles for the underbody shields on the 2020 Escape.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This move could be an important step toward more sustainable car production. At the same time, it shows just how far Ford has to go. They&#39;re small parts in an SUV that&#39;s sold exclusively with a combustion engine inside — this would carry more weight if they were larger components in a hybrid or pure electric vehicle. Ford has vowed to further <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-will-only-sell-electrified-vehicles-in-europe-by-2030-113015462.html">electrify its lineup</a> and explore future uses of ocean plastic.

If a component is listed as an &quot;unknown part,&quot; it&#39;s either unofficial, an already-used part from another iPhone or malfunctioning.</p><p>Just how much you&#39;ll learn depends on your iPhone model.

Apple stressed that these alerts won&#39;t prevent you from using your device — you&#39;re fine if you&#39;re comfortable using unofficial parts and losing warranty coverage.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>iOS 15.2 currently exists as a release candidate for developers, suggesting the finished version will be available relatively soon. It&#39;s not yet clear if iPad owners will see a corresponding part history feature at some point.</p><p>The &quot;unknown part&quot; label might not thrill advocates for third-party component options. Apple clearly wants you to use official parts, and that means either taking it in for authorized service or (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-self-service-repair-iphone-mac-142122774.html">in 2022</a>) buying parts from Apple. This might help you catch shops lying about the quality of their parts, though, and could be useful if you repair an iPhone yourself and want to be sure your fixes went smoothly.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-2-genuine-repair-parts-174546070.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">df0c8187-af16-4774-ae0b-b8cb86e61af3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:45:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638985550</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T17:46:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9213c0a0-1ed8-11ec-a7fd-a6bf9eb4f536" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9213c0a0-1ed8-11ec-a7fd-a6bf9eb4f536" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro in gold — back view]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 Pro in gold — back view]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GTA Online's next big update features Dr. Dre and Franklin from 'GTA V']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/rockstar%20games/">Rockstar Games</a> will soon release another big update for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/gta%20online/"><em><ins>GTA Online</ins></em></a>, which includes a story mission featuring one of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/GTA%20V/"><em><ins>Grand Theft Auto V</ins></em><ins>&#39;s</ins></a> main characters. &quot;The Contract&quot; centers around Franklin Clinton and his friends, who aspire to be problem solvers for celebrities and &quot;rich folk who got rich folk problems.&quot;</p><p>One of those potential clients is Dr. Dre, who appears as himself in the story.

The tool essentially simulates what a conversation like that may look like with the help of AI chatbots. At launch, the CCS came with access to one such “persona.” Today, The Trevor Project is <a href="https://www.thetrevorproject.org/blog/the-trevor-project-expands-its-ai-innovation-with-new-crisis-contact-simulator-persona-to-scale-counselor-training/">adding a second one called Drew</a>. The new chatbot represents a fictional youth in their early 20s who lives in California and faces bullying and harassment.</p><p>Since implementing its first persona, the aptly named Trevor, in February, the organization says the technology has helped train more than 1,000 counselors. One thing to note here is The Trevor Project is using the Crisis Contact Simulator to complement its existing training methods; the tool is not a replacement for in-person training.

Machine learning systems can help alleviate some of this burden by automating the policy enforcement process, however modern AI systems often require months of lead time to properly train and deploy (time mostly spent collecting and annotating the thousands, if not millions of, necessary examples). To shorten that response time, at least to a matter of weeks rather than months, Meta’s AI research group (formerly FAIR) <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.14690.pdf">has developed a more generalized technology</a> that requires just a handful of specific examples in order to respond to new and emerging forms of malicious content, called Few-Shot Learner (FSL).</p><p>Few-shot learning is a relatively recent development in AI, essentially teaching the system to make accurate predictions based on a limited number of training examples — quite the opposite of conventional supervised learning methods. For example, if you wanted to train a standard SL model to recognize pictures of rabbits, you feed it a couple hundred thousand rabbit pictures and then you can present it with two images and ask if they both show the same animal. Thing is, the model doesn’t know if the two pictures are of rabbits because it doesn’t actually know what a rabbit is. That’s because the model’s purpose isn’t to spot rabbits, the model’s purpose is to look for similarities and differences between the presented images and predict whether or not the things displayed are the same. There is no larger context for the model to work within, which makes it only good for telling “rabbits” apart — it can’t tell you if it’s looking at an image of a rabbit, or of a lion, or of a John Cougar Mellencamp, just that those three entities are not the same thing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="63d90029fa404788975f4678c771df7f"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/0fJyXvO" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>FSL relies far less on labelled data (i.e. pictures of rabbits) in favor of a generalized system, more akin to how humans learn than conventional AIs. “It’s first trained on billions of generic and open-source language examples,” per a Wednesday Meta blog post. “Then, the AI system is trained with <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__transparency.fb.com_features_approach-2Dto-2Dranking_content-2Ddistribution-2Dguidelines_content-2Dborderline-2Dto-2Dthe-2Dcommunity-2Dstandards_&amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=nq7G5BV3pUJKzCGIu8cu5_tCus3U1C00PIx5p0WG07A&amp;m=W_gGKUlJZmdjHRDSGJwMk1WvQKkih20AvL1uv-AHrdA&amp;s=iykgbeuxOzQP-V5xTgniBEzjaSAwPNs4WBMZ4LIur3M&amp;e=">integrity-specific data</a> we’ve labeled over the years. Finally, it’s trained on condensed text explaining a new policy.” And unlike the rabbit-matching model above, FSL “is pretrained on both general language and integrity-specific language so it can learn the policy text implicitly.”</p><p>Recent tests of the FSL system have proven encouraging. Meta researchers looked at the change in prevalence of harmful content shown to Facebook and Instagram users before and after FSL’s activation on the sites. The system both found harmful content that conventional SL models had missed and reduced the prevalence of that content in general. The FSL system reportedly outperformed other few-shot models by as much as 55 percent (though only 12 percent on average).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/969af200-57a5-11ec-9f2f-58cccf12ef42" alt="FSL Prevalence Graph the numbers are going down" data-uuid="d2f3768b-8bcd-39f2-9c32-95084353d122"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Meta</div></figure><p>FSL’s improved performance is thanks in part to entailment, <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/entailment#:~:text=noun,an%20entailment%20of%20the%20job.">defined as</a> “the act or fact of entailing, or involving by necessity or as a consequence.” It’s essentially a logical consequence between two sentences — if sentence A is true, then sentence B must also be true. For example, if sentence A is “The President was assassinated,” then it entails that sentence B, “the President is dead,” is also true, accurate and correct. By leveraging entailment in the FSL system, the team is able to “convert the class label into a natural language sentence which can be used to describe the label, and determine if the example entails the label description,” Meta AI researchers explained. So instead of trying to generalize what a conventional SL model knows from its training set (hundreds of thousands of rabbit pics) to the test set (“are these two images of rabbits?”), the FSL model can more broadly recognize harmful content when it sees it, because it understands the policy that the content violates.</p><p>The added flexibility of having a “single, shared knowledge base and backbone” could one day enable AI moderation systems to recognize and react to new forms of harmful content far more quickly, catch more content that just barely skirts around current policies and even help Meta develop and better define future policies.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metas-prototype-moderation-ai-only-needs-a-few-examples-of-bad-behavior-to-take-action-170005410.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ae0fcc97-8149-4a28-9d2c-f39045d7e3fc</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 17:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638983854</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T17:17:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c5c883b0-4159-11ec-beff-be4d5e13ee6f" width="4813" height="3124" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c5c883b0-4159-11ec-beff-be4d5e13ee6f" width="4813" height="3124" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A 3D printed Facebook's new rebrand logo Meta and Facebook logo are seen in this illustration taken on November 2, 2021.

The smart speaker firm has <a href="https://www.sonos.com/en-us/newsroom/sonos-sustainability">unveiled</a> an inaugural climate plan that will make its &quot;value chain&quot; carbon neutral by 2030, and achieve net zero emissions by 2040.

Fiscal 2023 will also mark the release of Sonos&#39; first devices designed explicitly with recycling and reuse in mind, such as easier-to-remove fasteners in place of glue.

From security cameras to smart light bulbs, pretty much any internet-connected device that you can control via an app is enough to get you started on your smart home journey. But before you dive in, we advise taking a few preliminary steps. For one, don’t try to outfit your entire smart home in one go. Not only can this be quite expensive, we think it’s generally best to buy just one or two items first to see if you like them. From there, you can figure out if you want to buy more devices, making sure that they’re compatible with one another. Below are our suggestions for the best of each smart device category, with alternate suggestions where appropriate.</p><h2>Before you start, pick a voice assistant</h2><p>While plenty of smart home devices are platform agnostic, there are some — smart speakers and smart displays in particular — that require you to choose your voice assistant. Currently, that means deciding if you’ll use the Google Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa on a regular basis. (I’ll address Siri in a moment.) They’re both compatible with various smart home products from light bulbs to robot vacuums, but there are certain devices that work best with either Google or Amazon. Nest products, for example, are more compatible with Google-powered speakers and displays. They can still work with Amazon devices, but certain features might be disabled. The same holds true with Amazon products: They work better if they’re in the same ecosystem.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So how do you choose between Alexa and Google Assistant? It really depends on your personal preferences. Do you listen to Audible, watch Prime Video and tend to do a lot of shopping on Amazon? Then you might lean toward an Alexa-powered product. Do you use a lot of Google services like YouTube and Google Podcasts? A Google-powered device might be best.</p><p>If you want a voice assistant that’s great at answering questions, Google Assistant tends to be better than Alexa. Amazon’s helper, on the other hand, currently supports more smart home products. The company’s smart speakers and displays also support the Zigbee smart home protocol, and some devices even have built-in smart home hubs. Both Google and Amazon devices can sync with your calendar, though Google’s tend to work better with Google services. Plus, if you already have an Android phone, you might be more comfortable with Google Assistant anyway.</p><p>But what about Siri? Apple’s assistant is an option as well, but it doesn’t have the same level of device support as Google and Amazon. The HomePod mini and the (now discontinued) HomePod are the only Siri-compatible speakers on the market at the moment, too. That said, it’s not too hard to find HomeKit-compatible gear as more third-party companies add support for it, but you currently have a smaller pool of devices to choose from.</p><h2>Engadget picks</h2><h3>Best smart speaker: Sonos One</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-04/914b9040-7a8c-11ea-9ee7-aa6c14e6afb5" alt="Sonos One smart speaker." data-uuid="77872500-1368-45aa-9f4c-36cc0673f1ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham</div></figure><p>Our recommendation for the best smart speaker is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Sonos One" href="https://fave.co/31LNvla">Sonos One</a>. It’s compact enough to fit in most areas in your home, but more importantly, it delivers excellent audio quality that’s superior to a lot of other smart speakers out there. When tuned properly to the acoustics of your room — which requires the iOS app — the sound is fantastic, with punchy bass and clear highs. Unfortunately, the Android app doesn’t have TruePlay tuning (Sonos has not said whether it’s in the works), but the speakers should still sound admirable.

Out of the three, we think the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo" href="https://amzn.to/3FdU1zQ">Echo</a> has the best audio quality. Our colleague Nate Ingraham <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-2020-review-130046336.html">said</a> its bass is impressive and the mid-range frequencies are pretty powerful.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Echo Show 8</a>, on the other hand, is perfectly sized for most rooms in the house. Like other Alexa-powered smart displays, it supports plenty of video streaming services including Amazon Prime, Hulu and Netflix and it comes with a couple of built-in browsers that you can use to surf the web. Unfortunately, it doesn’t support YouTube, which is a pretty notable omission considering how ubiquitous the service is. As a workaround, you can access it via the aforementioned browsers, but the experience isn’t as smooth as if it were a native app.</p><p>You can use the Show 8 to make video calls with any phone or tablet with the Alexa app. Alternatively, it supports Skype, Zoom and Amazon’s own Chime service.

It has a 7-inch screen, which makes it just big enough to fit in most rooms in the house. The size also makes it work well as a digital photo frame. You can set it up to pull in pictures of friends and family from your Google Photos library, and there’s a smart algorithm that automatically uses the best shots while avoiding the blurry ones. As you might expect, you can also use the display to watch YouTube, Netflix and other streaming services.</p><p>Plus, a smart display without a camera is great if you want to place it in more intimate places like the bedroom, where you might be more protective of your privacy.

Its built-in camera can be used for video calls with Google Duo, Google Meet and Zoom. It also has an optional face-tracking feature that lets the camera follow you around during calls. One benefit of the camera is that it gives you the option for Face Match, a feature that automatically recognizes individual members of the house and then displays the information that’s pertinent only to them, like calendar alerts.</p><p>Additionally, the camera adds a unique gestures feature that lets you play and pause media simply by holding up your hand to the screen, which is convenient if you need to stop the music without having to shout across the room.

Smart light bulbs let you control your lighting remotely, either via an app and with your voice. They add automation and scheduling to the mix, so you can have them turn on and off at certain times of the day. Some also let you adjust their brightness and color temperature, or even let you create a custom light scene.</p><p>Our favorite smart lighting products come from Philips Hue, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:White and Color Ambiance LED Smart Button Starter Kit" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjRaO6">White and Color Ambiance LED Smart Button Starter Kit</a> is a particularly good entry point as it includes three Philips Hue White and Color Ambiance 60W LED smart bulbs; a Hue hub that lets you control up to 50 lights; and a Smart Button if you want to have the option of turning off the lights without having your phone around.</p><p>This kit offers lots of versatility in lighting styles; you can change not just the brightness but also the color temperature and experiment with all different shades of the rainbow, decking out your room in whatever light scene you desire. If that seems a little too daring, Philips offers alternatives: The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit" href="https://amzn.to/3CeFthg">Hue White Ambiance Starter Kit</a> lacks the color option, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hue White Starter Kit" href="https://amzn.to/3wDkCmw">Hue White Starter Kit</a> won’t let you adjust the color temperature.</p><p>The main reason we prefer Philips Hue bulbs is that they’re widely supported across smart home ecosystems. Not only can you find them pretty much anywhere, but they’ll work with Google, Amazon and Apple’s HomeKit. Since all the bulbs connect to the Hue hub via the Zigbee protocol (and not your home’s WiFi), it tends to be more reliable and it won’t slow down your home internet connection either.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/GjRaO6" id="9fe2ec724416420ba4f7f91a1ba5627c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Philips Hue starter set at Best Buy - $130</a><h3>Best budget smart lights: Cync by GE</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/49403500-582d-11ec-bef3-22d267ca3d71" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="GE Cync smart light bulbs" data-uuid="fa1de799-ca8a-35b7-9c23-8b292251791c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">GE</div></figure><p>If you’re not quite ready to dive into a whole lighting ecosystem or you just prefer a more affordable alternative, we suggest GE’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart LED Bulb" href="https://amzn.to/3C9FSlg">Cync Full Color Direct Connect Smart LED Bulb</a>.

You can also customize Motion Detection Zones that allow you to adjust just how sensitive you want it to be. It also offers 24/7 continuous video recording that you can store via a 32GB microSD card (not included).</p><p>We especially like that the Wyze doesn’t require a subscription; free cloud storage is included with the purchase, and you’ll always have access to the last 14 days of recording on the app. Be warned, however, that the free account can only hold 12-second clips every five minutes. If you want it to record unlimited motion, consider upgrading to a Cam Plus subscription, which includes additional features like alerting you if it detects a person or a package.

And just in case you don’t have access to the app — maybe you left your phone in another room, for example — the Roomba 694 has manual controls as well.</p><p>One of the reasons the Roomba 694 cleans so well is that it has a three-stage system that tells it to suck up dirt while also navigating around obstacles. When it encounters an especially filthy area, it focuses in on it, making sure it’s clean before moving on. You can also manually instruct it to clean a specific spot in case you need it.

Just like with the Wyze Plug, you can schedule the plug to turn on and off at certain times and days of the week. On top of that, the Kasa actually offers scheduling around sunrise or sunset times, a feature that the Wyze lacks.

Anyone with an LG set running webOS 5.0 or 6.0 (that is, 2020 or newer) can use the cloud gaming service to play <em>Assassin&#39;s Creed</em> or <em>Madden</em> without requiring a media device or PC as a go-between. You&#39;ll need a compatible gamepad, but that shouldn&#39;t be an issue when the Stadia Controller and common console pads should work either wirelessly or through USB.</p><p>Not surprisingly, LG suggests one of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-c1-g1-series-oled-tvs-ces-2021-133053674.html">OLED TVs</a> for Stadia thanks to the fast pixel response times, low latency and (for Stadia Pro subscribers) 4K HDR visuals. They&#39;re certainly not required, though, and it&#39;s arguably the lag from game streaming that will make the larger difference.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Stadia is available through the LG Content Store in all 22 countries where the service already exists. You probably won&#39;t buy a TV with Stadia in mind, but this significantly widens the number of sets where native support is an option — you might be more inclined to try it if the barrier to entry is that much lower.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-lg-smart-tv-release-date-152718368.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">64752abf-fae3-4f24-b1b0-f52414eb4087</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 15:27:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638976469</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T15:14:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/786150b0-5834-11ec-befe-fc6ff23c8f2b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/786150b0-5834-11ec-befe-fc6ff23c8f2b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Stadia on LG Smart TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Stadia on LG Smart TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Polestar will increase its EV's horsepower with a €1,000 software update]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/polestar/"><ins>Polestar</ins></a> has <a href="https://media.polestar.com/global/en/media/pressreleases/642344"><ins>released</ins></a> an over-the-air update that boosts the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/polestar-2-ev-drive-video-133035906.html"><ins>Polestar 2&#39;s</ins></a> torque and horsepower.

Previously, that program was only open to users with Pages.

Those features are coming &quot;soon&quot; and it&#39;s planning to expand Reels to more countries next year, too. Professional Mode also lets profiles see the same kind of post and audience analytics data that Page users get, including shares, reactions and comments. You can also see your follower growth over time.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s a caveat that, not surprisingly, involves privacy. Once you turn on professional mode, &quot;anyone can follow you and see your public content in their feed,&quot; Facebook said. However, you&#39;ll still be able to limit specific posts or updates to friends only.</p><p>Facebook is playing catchup to rival platforms with the creator community, particularly TikTok, which recently passed 3 billion downloads and is ahead of Facebook in user engagement. On top of the new profiles, it recently introduced the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/07/facebooks-new-website-lets-fans-buy-stars-without-paying-the-app-stores-commissions/">Stars store website</a> that lets creators earn cash from followers without paying app store commissions. Professional mode is testing with a limited number of profiles today in the US, but will be expanded to more people in the US &quot;soon&quot; and more countries in the coming months.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-introduces-a-new-professional-mode-for-creators-140006876.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd9bdd0f-4477-4363-b683-aa4a167dc39a</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 14:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638967259</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T12:41:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b5987980-581c-11ec-adff-c9a7048a056a" width="2000" height="1035" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b5987980-581c-11ec-adff-c9a7048a056a" width="2000" height="1035" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook's 'professional mode' lets creators monetize without a separate Page]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook's 'professional mode' lets creators monetize without a separate Page]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[8Bitdo's SN30 Pro+ controller drops to $40 for today only]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Update, 1:17pm ET:</strong> The Lightning Deal on the 8Bitdo SN30 Pro+ has now expired.</p><p>8Bitdo controllers have been some of our favorites thanks to their charming designs and affordable prices.

While plenty of people will want to use it with Nintendo&#39;s console, the SN30 Pro+ is also compatible with PC, macOS, Android, Steam and Raspberry Pi.</p><p>Not only did we find the SN30 Pro+ to be even more comfortable than Nintendo&#39;s own Switch Pro Controller, it also has the added benefit of a removable battery pack. It&#39;ll last about 20 hours on a single charge, but in a pinch, you can take out that pack and replace it with AA batteries instead. That&#39;ll come in handy on long flights, camping trips and other situations in which you can&#39;t charge up for a while. We also appreciate that the <a href="https://support.8bitdo.com/ultimate-software.html">8BitDo Ultimate Software</a> lets you personalize the controller a bit further by remapping buttons and creating custom profiles.</p><p>The few gripes we had with the SN30 Pro+ were its somewhat tedious syncing process with the Switch (but thankfully you only have to do that once), its lack of a headphone jack and its lack of support for iOS, Xbox and PlayStation. However, if you&#39;re looking for a stocking stuffer for the gamer in your life, the SN30 Pro+ is hard to beat at this sale price.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/8-bitdos-sn-30-pro-plus-controller-drops-to-40-for-today-only-133621646.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c346769f-65d3-4033-bc65-9476f32d180d</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 13:36:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638987447</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T18:17:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2Fbeac8c50-deca-11e9-bbf5-6f5eb40d32bc&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=afa5d5a9e07e12a37648a5ccd33b6b96dcadcf6f" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?resize=2000%2C2000%2Cshrink&amp;image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2019-09%2Fbeac8c50-deca-11e9-bbf5-6f5eb40d32bc&amp;client=a1acac3e1b3290917d92&amp;signature=afa5d5a9e07e12a37648a5ccd33b6b96dcadcf6f" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[8Bitdo&#39;s SN30 Pro+ controller drops to $40 for today only]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple was reportedly forced to halt iPhone and iPad assembly for the first time in a decade]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple was forced to cease <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone</a> and iPad production for several days when it was supposed to kick into high gear, according to a report from <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/The-Big-Story/Apple-s-nightmare-before-Christmas-Supply-chain-crisis-delays-gift-deliveries"><em>Nikkei Asia</em></a>. It&#39;s no secret that Apple hasn&#39;t been immune to the global supply chain shortages despite its enormous purchasing power. The tech giant previously lowered its iPhone 13 production goals for the year and had to cut back on the iPad&#39;s production to allocate more parts for its mobile flagship devices. But this is reportedly the first time in a decade that the company had to cease operations at its factories during China&#39;s Golden Week.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple factories typically ramp up production during the Chinese holidays that take place at the beginning of October, running 24 hour shifts so that it can keep up with holiday shopping demands. This year, though, it reportedly gave its workers some time off instead. A supply chain manager told the publication that it made no sense to pay workers overtime for working during the holidays when there were very limited component and chips to work with. As a result, people who may be thinking of getting a new iPad or a new iPhone as a Christmas gift for loved ones or themselves may not get it in time for the season.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Nikkei Asia</em> says that supply chain issues started way before the pandemic, when Chinese companies blacklisted by the United States hoarded inventories to survive crackdowns. That said, the COVID-19 lockdowns implemented in Malaysia and Vietnam due to the Delta variant heavily affected the production of numerous electrical components and chips.&nbsp;</p><p>In many cases, bottlenecks weren&#39;t caused by the lack of a device&#39;s most expensive components, but its cheaper peripheral parts. Component manufacturers that don&#39;t have as much purchasing power as tech giants fall to the back of the list when it comes to raw materials, after all. For the iPhone 13 Max, for instance, tiny peripherals that only cost a few cents each are what&#39;s causing the delay.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple chief Tim Cook <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/28/apple-aapl-q4-2021-earnings.html">previously said</a> that the company lost $6 billion for the quarter ending in September due to supply chain constraints, and that he believes that it could lose more in the final quarter of the year. It still remains to be seen if Apple would still enjoy the same level of demand by the time it has the components to manufacture its devices. <em>Nikkei Asia</em> says Apple told suppliers that demand persists for the iPhone 13 and to reaccelerate their component production for November, December and January. According to a previous <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-warned-suppliers-slowing-demand-iphones-070948347.html"><em>Bloomberg report</em></a>, though, Apple warned suppliers that demand for its biggest revenue source has already weakened just before the holidays.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-reportedly-forced-to-halt-iphone-ipad-assembly-131714897.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e8fd40c-67ed-4bef-9f0d-b1f6dbb935ac</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 13:17:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638969623</ingested><modified>2021-12-08T13:20:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9f506060-5822-11ec-bf5b-acf849375663" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9f506060-5822-11ec-bf5b-acf849375663" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: The Hubble telescope wakes up from 'hibernation']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#39;s Hubble telescope has been in a month-long nap since going into system failure in late October. However, early yesterday, the agency announced it is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-hubble-telescope-is-operational-again-155710162.html">waking Hubble up</a>. NASA says the telescope is now functioning as normal, with all four active instruments collecting data.</p><p>On October 23rd, NASA first noticed Hubble&#39;s instruments weren&#39;t receiving messages from the telescope&#39;s control unit. NASA ended up putting the telescope into a sort of safe mode while it tried to figure out what happened. That safe mode takes a long time to come out of because of the sensitivity of Hubble&#39;s hardware. Rapid power or temperature changes aren&#39;t good for its lifespan. The telescope is now 31 years old — Hubble may be nearing the end of its useful life in space. NASA will use the telescope till the end, though, planning to use it in tandem with the Webb telescope, which is expected to finally launch on December 22nd.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/discord-premium-memberships-announcement-160019679.html https://www.engadget.com/...">Discord gives server owners the tools to put channels behind a paywall</a></h2><h3>The company is testing Premium Memberships with a small group of users.</h3><h3></h3><p>Discord has started testing a feature called Premium Memberships.
