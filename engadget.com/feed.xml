The move will maintain the &quot;continued safety&quot; of visitors while the museum finishes work on its first new west wing galleries.</p><p>The closure is part of the first phase of a seven-year renovation poised to cost over $1 billion. The Smithsonian is staggering closures to keep at least some physical museum spaces open during that period, including the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center in Virginia (which will remain open). Some parts of the collection have relocated to other relevant museums in the meantime, such as the Museum of African American History and Culture, the Museum of Natural History and the Museum of the American Indian.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The wait could be worthwhile. Eight west wing exhibits should launch when the main museum reopens, including &quot;One World Connected&quot; (shown above) and spaces touching on the Wright brothers, planetary exploration and the Moon.</p><p>Some parts of the renovation are still far from completion. The museum will start &quot;deinstallation&quot; of the east wing in March and won&#39;t complete its upgrade until sometime in 2025. If you can live with those limitations, though, the Air and Space Museum may soon be more relevant and engaging than in the past — even if you&#39;ve visited relatively recently.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/smithsonian-air-and-space-museum-closed-renovations-182003676.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f193ff1e-845a-416d-8b17-1a034c14269a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:20:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637690478</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T18:01:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture Organizations]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ec711990-4c81-11ec-8ffe-e43800f84d1d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/ec711990-4c81-11ec-8ffe-e43800f84d1d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Smithsonian Air and Space Museum 'One Connected World' exhibit rendering]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Smithsonian Air and Space Museum 'One Connected World' exhibit rendering]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple sues NSO Group over state-backed spyware]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple is more than a little angry at NSO Group for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-security-flaw-al-jazeera-journalist-spying-215710995.html">developing spyware tools</a>. The iPhone maker has <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/11/apple-sues-nso-group-to-curb-the-abuse-of-state-sponsored-spyware/">filed a lawsuit</a> against NSO to &quot;hold it accountable&quot; for governments spying on and targeting Apple device users.

However, Apple stressed that targets are frequently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html">activists, journalists</a> and other critics of regimes that routinely suppress political dissent.

There are <em>so</em> many versions of it around: From stock Android to Google’s own Pixel-first edition to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-phones-get-update-to-one-ui-4-110031121.html">Samsung’s One UI 4 overlay</a>, there are enough variants to overrun <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-loki-finale-episode-six-163019038.html">the Time Variance Authority</a> (<em>Loki</em>, anyone?). That means that writing a review of Android 12 is a complicated task. With so many branded and device specific tweaks, it can be hard at times to differentiate core Android features from the window dressing.</p><p>The land of Android is messy, but we’re going to keep this review of Android 12 simple. If you want an idea of the Pixel-only features, head over to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-review-specs-camera-samples-battery-test-160014200.html">our Pixel 6 Pro review</a> where I covered things like Live Translate and Magic Eraser. Features like HDR Net videos and white balance controls are also exclusive to Pixels, though that doesn’t mean they won’t one day <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-google-photos-gboard-other-android-devices-160039468.html">roll out more widely</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>Material You everywhere</strong></h2><p>Functionally, that means there isn’t much obviously different for those on other devices upgrading to Android 12. The biggest change will be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-material-you-android-personalized-redesign-182501466.html">new Material You design</a>, and how much of that makes its way to your particular handset will depend on your phone’s maker.</p><p>On <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/one-ui-4-update-delivers-an-elevated-mobile-experience-centered-around-you">One UI 4</a>, for example, you’ll get something similar to Material You by way of Samsung’s “whole host of new Color Palettes,” which like Google’s version will apply to menus, buttons and icons. But these aren’t automatically generated by the phone based on your wallpaper, and have a distinct Samsung-y cartoonish style that Galaxy users will find familiar. One UI 4 and Android 12 both also offer new widgets that look much better and offer more customization options than before.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1f25db00-4bd3-11ec-8dbe-c72fd622aab4" alt="Two screenshots showing the Android 12 Material You theme. The first is the Wallpaper &amp; Style settings page, the second screenshot shows the notifications and quick settings shade in the same color palette." data-uuid="89f806bc-933c-3b97-a5f7-3b844c872d47"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>So Android 12 is a nice visual change, but it does go beyond aesthetics and affects how you interact with the system. Sliders and buttons are larger than before, which some might find ugly compared to the cleaner, thinner options of Androids past.</p><p>After living with this new style for a few months, I’ve gotten used to the extra chonky navigational elements. In fact, in some apps, like Clock, the bigger targets are easier to see, and I can hit the Snooze slider more easily from bed. They even look pretty thanks to Material You, which beautifully infuses everything from the Settings shade to keyboards and numpads. I also like that the new lock screen clock takes over the whole display when you don’t have any notifications.</p><p>There’s plenty of little things that Google added throughout Android 12, like new animations across the interface and updated limits to toast dialogs. Those are the little boxes that pop up at the bottom of the screen when you copy text to your clipboard, for example. I’ll focus on just a few of the more obvious changes, starting with the quick settings panel and notification shade.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/8d47b6c0-4bd4-11ec-bef5-d54f97b5f96b" alt="Two screenshots showing the Android 12 Settings and Notifications shade. On the left is the quick settings panel with a couple of notifications, on the right is the expanded settings panel showing the display slider and eight toggles." data-uuid="c1044b03-4ccf-35aa-9e12-372924faad5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>In general, Google’s been busy decluttering. It removed the redundant “Conversations” and “Notifications” headers from the notifications list that took up extra lines, while using a background color in this area that’s close to the cards, making everything blend more smoothly. The Quick Settings area up top has a black background and just four buttons compared to the six from before, which means you’ll now need an extra swipe to access things like Battery Saver or Auto Rotate toggles. Of course, you can rearrange these to put your favorites first, but you’ll only be able to pick four.</p><p>This is a bummer, but at least when you make that extra swipe in Android 12, you’ll see eight settings shortcuts as opposed to just six. The net convenience lost or gained here is… kinda zero.</p><p>I also don’t love that Android 12 will default to summoning the Google Assistant when you long press the power button, but at least you can revert it to show the restart, shut down, lock and emergency buttons.</p><p>One of the most common ways I interact with my phone is by tapping the search bar at the bottom and typing either the name of an app I want or the show I’m about to watch. Nothing’s changed here since Android 11, you’ll still see your recent entries and suggested apps when you hit the text field. But if you use the search bar in the All Apps drawer, which requires a swipe up, you’ll get Android 12’s universal search. This will let you find things on your phone, including not just apps and contacts, but conversations within supported apps as well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e4c68c50-4bd4-11ec-bd99-0f73733b4ec0" alt="A pair of screenshots showing Android 12&#39;s universal search results. On the left are the results for the letter " data-uuid="1e813942-2d86-38cf-9dd2-c32b26309da3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I randomly hit “D,” and was shown a row of suggested apps, like Discord and Discovery+. Below that was a list of people from various apps, like my colleague Devindra on Gmail, as well as conversations with some guys named Dan and Dylan from Hinge. It also showed actions from specific apps, like “Submit a Front Desk instruction” in my building’s portal and “Connect with Mat Smith” on Duo. When I typed “the,” I got suggestions to order from “The Old Spot” on Uber Eats and quickly hail a ride to “The Westin Grand, Berlin” on Uber. Both are places I’d saved as favorites.</p><p>Finally, at the bottom, you’ll find an option to submit your query to Google’s search engine. Chances that I’ll scroll so far down the list are slim, but at least it gets shorter the more letters entered.</p><h2><strong>More privacy and battery information</strong></h2><p>Most of the changes in Android 12 I’ve described so far are in your face, and you’ll see them as you interact with the system. Others, like the new Privacy Dashboard, are things you’ll have to look for in Settings.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1c5ff250-4bd5-11ec-bf3e-f4490fb44f99" alt="Two screenshots showing the Android 12 Battery and Privacy settings pages. " data-uuid="d2dceef2-a318-3214-b455-2ead6753aed6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That means they’ll be less impactful on your daily use, but they are, for the most part, informative. The Privacy Dashboard helped me realize that my camera and mic are activated a <em>ton</em> and showed the apps I most often use that require them. And speaking of, Android 12 also provides new indicators for when your mic and camera are being used (a green dot appears in the top right corner of the screen). This is basically the same as on iOS, except Google requires one more tap on the dot to see which app is accessing the sensor.</p><p>While the Battery Usage page isn’t new, it’s now more prominently featured as the first option in the Battery settings panel — you won’t have to tap a separate three-dot button to find it. Google did appear to update the graph showing your power levels for the last 24 hours, with the horizontal axis now poorly labeled with just the numbers 1, 7, 1, 7 and 1 (or 13, 19, 01, 07, 13 on the phone I set to military time) instead of “xx hr ago” and “xx min left”. I found myself ignoring this chart most of the time, since it isn’t all that helpful.</p><p>In the months I’ve been using Android 12, I’ve seen more apps ask for permission to access my specific or approximate location. I almost never selected the latter, but it’s nice to have the option for things like the weather app. In general, though, I relied on the “Allow this time” or “Allow while using” choices as a way to grant limited permissions to apps. Google will also tell you, after some time, which apps you haven’t used in awhile. It’ll automatically revoke permissions for those, which is nice. None of these apps were things I used often enough for this to be a problem.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3ce23e20-4bd5-11ec-9df5-a00615e610e7" alt="Three screenshots showing apps that make use of the Material You color scheme: Clock, Recorder and Calendar. " data-uuid="5ce629a3-f45f-3c20-9080-ce240e2dea95"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>That’s… pretty much it for the major new Android 12 features. I’m still waiting to see an app that uses the new audio-coupled haptic feedback, since I enjoy the sensation it adds to games I’ve played on the iPhone 13 Pro. But there don’t appear to be any at the moment. Google is also constantly pushing out security and stability updates for Android 12, so maybe there are still more features to come.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>Ultimately, the biggest things Android 12 brings are Material You design and more privacy tools. That might seem minor on paper, but the visual refresh and faster animations throughout the system make it feel drastically different. Plus, Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-updates-locked-folder-night-sight-videos-clipboard-android-safety-160012247.html">continues</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-update-june-2021-starred-messages-earthquake-detection-alert-voice-access-password-160100755.html">drop feature sets</a> every <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-scheduled-text-messages-maps-dark-mode-talkback-screen-reader-auto-password-checkup-170022939.html">quarter or so</a>, meaning each version of Android doesn’t have to be as major of an upgrade. But if you’ve been looking for a fresh face for your phone, Android 12 is a fun, satisfying update.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-review-material-you-privacy-controls-180010087.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2651d6f6-8c43-47be-89fb-620b26692bf4</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 18:00:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637687905</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T17:18:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9f9e2680-4bd2-11ec-9dfd-844877790d9b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A phone showing the Android 12 easter egg, which is the OS logo on a background of circles themed to the system's color scheme.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo of America head responds to 'distressing' situation at Activision Blizzard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Add Nintendo to the list of major gaming companies that say they&#39;re disappointed with Activision Blizzard following last week&#39;s bombshell <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> report on the publisher and CEO Bobby Kotick.

However, there&#39;s no mention of reassessing the relationship with Activision like Xbox chief Phil Spencer said was on the table in his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-phil-spencer-activision-blizzard-203557204.html">message to Microsoft employees</a>. What he does mention is that Nintendo is working with the <a href="https://www.theesa.com/">Entertainment Software Association</a>, a lobbying group that represents both Nintendo and Activision, to strengthen its stance on harassment and workplace abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“Every company in the industry must create an environment where everyone is respected and treated as equals, and where all understand the consequences of not doing so,” he said in the email.</p><p>Bowser reportedly sent the letter on Friday, November 19th, to all levels of the company, including internal development teams like Retro Studios. Nintendo of America later confirmed the authenticity of the email. &quot;We can confirm the content of Doug Bowser&#39;s internal email to Nintendo of America staff is accurate,&quot; a spokesperson for the company told <em>Fanbyte</em>. &quot;We have nothing further to share on this topic.&quot;</p><p>According to <em>The Journal</em>, Kotick knew about many of the incidents of sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard and, at times, acted to protect abusers at the company. He also allegedly acted as one himself at times. In a statement to Engadget, a spokesperson for the company said the article presented a &quot;misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our CEO.&quot; The report drew an outcry from Activision Blizzard employees who <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html">staged a walkout</a> on the day it was published.

The company had dabbled in the app world before with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-10-19-moog-filtatron-app-makes-your-ios-band-seem-almost-plausible.html">Filtatron</a>, which was an emulation of the classic Moog ladder filter. But <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-12-21-animoog-2-0-accelerometer-modulation.html">Animoog</a> was a different beast entirely. It was a full-fledged software instrument that used <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-02-modal-electronics-craftsynth-2-0-hands-on-demo-portable-music.html">wavetable synthesis</a>, often associated with cold and complex digital sounds that are in many ways the antithesis of what Moog stood for. But, the app turned out to be a huge success. And for its tenth anniversary it’s finally getting a proper sequel in Animoog Z.</p><p>The core, which Moog calls Anisotropic Synth Engine, is largely the same. Of the dozens of waveforms you choose up to eight at a time from. They range from samples of analog saw waves to decidedly more digital sounds. What makes it relatively unique is the ‘orbit’ and ‘path’ modules which shape the timbre. The way they work is hard to describe, but basically notes you play travel along a path drawn in space, and orbit around that path. You control the speed and intensity of distance of the orbit, as well as the speed at which it travels along the path and that determines how the sound of each note evolves, in a relatively opaque way.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/43758cd0-4c73-11ec-a7e6-04a9f88b818d" alt="Animoog Z" data-uuid="162eb21c-5181-3bdf-8f74-7168bd7f3d5f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Moog</div></figure><p>The big change here from the original app is that Animoog Z adds a third dimension to the path. So instead of just traveling along an X and Y axis, the notes also can move along this Z axis. This gives the new app just a touch more depth and notes a bit more room to evolve. The difference can be subtle at times, but certain presets in Animoog Z take advantage of additional modulation path to create truly wild and complex sounds. (Just check out Downward Spiral and Ball Lightning.)</p><p>There’s also a  new effects section with a looper, delay, filter, an arpeggiator and a “thick” section. Thick was also in the original app and it just offers a variety of ways to beef up your sound, from adding detune, drive and bit crushing effects. While a few of these are holdovers from the original, the way they’re grouped together here makes sound design a little more fluid and linear.</p><p>The whole app has received a massive face lift that not only makes it feel more modern, but also makes it easier to navigate. While the UI can feel a bit cramped on an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-12-23-animoog-debuts-diy-synth-studio-for-iphone-4-byo-talent-video.html">iPhone</a>, it’s still light years beyond the original. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to test it on an iPad or a Mac, so I can’t speak to how well the interface scales up when it has space to breathe. But, the general layout is clean, logical and consistent.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4372cdb0-4c73-11ec-bbe7-d7e9aace2646" alt="Animoog Z" data-uuid="958075a7-e440-34ae-a363-1128e558bd84"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Moog</div></figure><p>The LFO, mod and envelope sections are more accessible and more powerful than their counterparts in the original app. In Animoog Z there is an entire tab dedicated to envelopes, with a clearly labeled amp envelope, and you’ll find it in the same place you’ll find the FX, orbit, filter, path and LFO tabs. There’s no need to go searching. In the original some of these features were scattered amongst dropdown menus. There are also just a lot more options for routing modulation in the new app.</p><p>Lastly, Moog added MPE support to the app, and even offers a limited version of it through the touchscreen interface. If you expand the keyboard, you can slide your fingers up and down individual notes to add unique modulation to each. You can also bend each note individually by moving your fingers. One of the great ways to add a little character to your playing is to turn down the keyboard correction and turn up the glide which will just by dint of your imperfect and imprecise human fingers add subtle detuning and bends as you play. With the right settings this can simulate everything from subtle analog drift to the tape warbles of a dying Walkman.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/43745450-4c73-11ec-bbfd-97956623ec9f" alt="Animoog Z" data-uuid="99edc65b-4037-37b3-badf-7e21e06e7e9f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Moog</div></figure><p>Animoog Z is available as a free download, but only in an extremely limited version. You can play the built-in presets and manipulate some basic parameters, but if you want full access to all its features you’ll need to pay $10. One nice change here is the flat price no matter the platform. Currently the iPhone version Animoog is $10, but it’s $20 on the iPad. Animoog Z is $10 no matter where you’re using it.</p><p>Animoog is definitely starting to look and feel its age. So this sequel couldn’t have come at a better time. And Animoog Z is definitely a worthy successor to this groundbreaking app.</p><div id="9271a5d581ad4ac7867020dae439d1e7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZR0PJ8c8HS4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/moog-animoog-z-i-os-softsynth-music-app-170019893.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7321ad22-6650-47d8-ab4a-71448a007784</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 17:00:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637683191</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T16:00:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/43758cd0-4c73-11ec-a7e6-04a9f88b818d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/56643300-4c73-11ec-bfaf-db6c11907338" width="2216" height="1478" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Moog Music]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Animoog Z]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Animoog Z]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Game Boy Advance 'hacked' to run PlayStation games using a Raspberry Pi]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-game-boy-advance-20th-anniversary-150023359.html">Game Boy Advance</a> is useful in the modern era for more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tenet-game-boy-advance-bob-wulff-christopher-nolan-202848161.html">watching Christopher Nolan blockbusters</a>. <em>Gizmodo</em><a href="https://gizmodo.com/super-powered-cartridge-lets-the-game-boy-advance-run-p-1848109189">notes</a> that tinkerer Rodrigo Alfonso has Nintendo&#39;s 20-year-old handheld <a href="https://github.com/rodri042/gba-remote-play">running</a> PlayStation (and Genesis, and SNES) games without special modifications. The trick, as you might imagine revolves around a custom cartridge — you&#39;re technically running the game on a separate system.</p><p>The cartridge houses a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-14-raspberry-pi-3-model-b-plus.html">Raspberry Pi 3</a> mini-computer running the RetroPie emulator and streaming both video and input through the GBA&#39;s multiplayer-oriented Link Port. Yes, that&#39;s constraining as you think it is — you can&#39;t transfer more than 1.6Mbps bi-directionally, and the Pi has to routinely give the &quot;poor&quot; GBA&#39;s processor a break for a few microseconds. Alfonso suggests lowering the stream resolution from the console&#39;s native 240 x 160 if a high frame rate is important.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Still, the results are mostly impressive. The special cart can handle classics like the <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> series and <em>Spyro the Dragon</em> at smooth frame rates, albeit with some video artifacts that reflect the limited bandwidth. You can overclock the GBA&#39;s processor to improve the frame rate and quality.</p><p>You&#39;ll have to build the cartridge and load code yourself, although Alfonso has helpfully provided both <a href="https://github.com/rodri042/gba-remote-play">on GitHub</a>. This probably won&#39;t replace <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wont-stop-selling-psp-games-after-july-2nd-065844351.html">a PSP</a> if you want the most authentic PlayStation handheld experience you can get.

As <em>Kotaku</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/activisions-damage-control-reaches-sad-new-low-1848107710">reports</a>, the developer has <a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-board-directors-continues-build-upon-its">formed</a> a &quot;Workplace Responsibility Committee&quot; to help it implement new anti-harassment and anti-discrimination efforts. While that sounds useful at first, there&#39;s a concern the initial committee is more symbolic than functional.</p><p>The committee will launch with just two members, both of whom (chair Dawn Ostroff and Reveta Bowers) are existing independent board members. They, in turn, will report to the board and key Activision Blizzard executives — including CEO Bobby Kotick, who some argue is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-employees-call-ceo-bobby-kotick-resign-194513764.html">partly to blame for the scandal</a>. The duo will work with an outside coordinator and a consultant following the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-settles-eeoc-18-million-lawsuit-005806200.html">settlement with the EEOC</a>, but there&#39;s no mention of involving regular company staff or outsiders who weren&#39;t part of that court agreement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As such, it won&#39;t be surprising if the committee does little to satisfy critics. Employees and others have called on Kotick to resign, among other more substantial changes. There&#39;s also low confidence in leadership&#39;s ability to police itself — Jennifer Oneal, Blizzard&#39;s first female leader, allegedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-jen-oneal-step-down-mike-ybarra-213704384.html">left her position</a> feeling she was the target of discrimination by a seemingly irredeemable company culture. <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-11-19/activision-blizzard-s-atvi-board-is-full-of-ceo-bobby-kotick-s-friends?sref=10lNAhZ9">noted</a> that some board members (including Ostroff) are Kotick&#39;s longtime friends and connections, for that matter. The committee might need to take aggressive steps if it wants to prove it&#39;s more than a superficial gesture.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-harassment-committee-151913561.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">257e36a0-f998-4f29-84be-0af1e04ac655</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 15:19:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637680755</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T15:19:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cdc38340-494b-11ec-87dd-02450f302348" width="4200" height="3073" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cdc38340-494b-11ec-87dd-02450f302348" width="4200" height="3073" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Allen J.

The T7 supports optional password protection, but on the Touch, you can choose to use your fingerprint to unlock the device and access saved files. The T7 is physically protected as well with its shock- and drop-resistant body, which is also small enough to fit into nearly any pocket of any bag or backpack.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We also appreciate the use of ePCM technology and Dynamic Thermal Guard to control heat levels, which means that the drive won&#39;t overheat even when you&#39;re pushing it to its limits. And you may do that a lot depending on how you use the drive. It comes with both a USB-C to C cable and a USB-C to A cable, so it can work with most gadgets — including some game consoles.

Being the newest Apple Watch, we don&#39;t expect to see major discounts on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Series 7" href="https://amzn.to/3DOtAA8">Series 7</a> this holiday season — but you can get the wearable for $20 less right now on Amazon. The online retailer has a few colors of the Series 7 for $380, which is a record low. Some <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:GPS + Cellular models" href="https://amzn.to/3cG6fEV">GPS + Cellular models</a> are also $20 off, if you wanted to spring for the most independent version of the Watch.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DOtAA8" id="d97eb2818d4e4add9a43be4596d9d082" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Series 7 (GPS) at Amazon - $380</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3cG6fEV" id="0f99a95bff2c41ae9c4a10daab8a9a5b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Series 7 (GPS + Cellular) at Amazon - $480</a><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Series 7</a> retains the same footprint of the Series 6, but Apple enlarged the screen by slimming down the bezels to just 1.7mm. What that means in practice is that you have more screen real estate on your wrist, which makes a noticeably difference in usability. Everything is a bit clearer and less cramped, and more things can fit on the screen — like the on-display QWERTY keyboard that the Series 7 has access to in watchOS 8. That lets you type out iMessages whenever you want, although some may still prefer dictation or quick replies to that method.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This Apple Watch also charges a bit faster than previous versions. In our testing, we got 10 percent juice in just 10 minutes of charging, and the Watch was fully powered in under an hour. This will undoubtably come in handy if you forget to place your Watch in its charger overnight, or if you make use of Apple&#39;s sleep tracking feature and want to power up before heading out for the day.</p><p>Otherwise, the Series 7 is the most comprehensive Apple Watch to date. You&#39;re getting all of the sensors and features possible here including a blood oxygen sensor, an ECG measurement tool, GPS, heart rate monitor, altimeter and more. Also, you&#39;re getting an always-on display, which makes it easier to check notifications without raising your wrist. If you&#39;ve had your eye on the Series 7 since it was announced, this is the best deal we&#39;ve seen on it since then. However, those who can give up things like an always-on display and bloody oxygen and ECG tracking, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Watch SE" href="https://amzn.to/3cAA7Ti">Apple Watch SE</a> may be the better option since it&#39;s also on sale for an all-time low of $219.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

According to the watchdog, the two companies signed an agreement in 2018 that would prohibit both official and unofficial resellers of Apple and Apple-owned Beats products on Amazon&#39;s Italian website. That agreement allegedly contained contractual clauses that only allowed Amazon itself and select sellers &quot;chosen individually and in a discriminatory way&quot; to sell those items.</p><p>AGCM said in its announcement that those clauses violate article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. In addition, the watchdog said the agreement restricted cross-border sales, ultimately limiting buyers&#39; options and depriving them of the discounts typically offered by third-party sellers. The Italian authority <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-italy-antitrust-investigation-141046089.html">opened</a> the antitrust case against both companies in 2020 and even searched their offices in the country.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A total of 70 percent of consumer electronics purchases in the country are from Amazon, AGCM explained, and 40 percent were purchases from sellers that use the website as their main platform. That&#39;s why it&#39;s essential for Amazon to implement Italy&#39;s competition rules and ensure a level playing field for all sellers, as well as to ensure that buyers have access to more options.</p><p>AGCM imposed a fine of €68.7 million (US$77 million) on Amazon and a fine of €134.5 million (US$151.2 million) on Apple. It also ordered the companies to end the restrictions and allow the sale of Apple and Beats products on Amazon Italy in &quot;non-discriminatory manner.&quot; In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/italys-antitrust-fines-amazon-apple-more-than-200-mln-euros-alleged-collusion-2021-11-23/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Amazon called the imposed penalty &quot;disproportionate and unjustified.&quot; A spokesperson said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We reject the suggestion that Amazon benefits by excluding sellers from our store, since our business model relies on their success. As a result of the agreement, Italian customers can find the latest Apple and Beats products on our store, benefiting from a catalogue that more than doubled, with better deals and faster shipping.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Apple denied any wrongdoing:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;To ensure our customers purchase genuine products, we work closely with our reseller partners and have dedicated teams of experts around the world who work with law enforcement, customs and merchants to ensure only genuine Apple products are being sold.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>According to <em>Reuters</em>, both companies are planning to appeal the watchdog&#39;s penalty.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-apple-fined-228-million-italy-restricting-beats-sales-123325114.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b51f0908-6fa4-453d-8742-b074ed6d5ba2</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 12:33:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637670878</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T12:34:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a86b77c0-4c51-11ec-bbfe-527302eb48ec" width="3500" height="2308" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/a86b77c0-4c51-11ec-bbfe-527302eb48ec" width="3500" height="2308" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Andrew Matthews - PA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[General view of a pair of beats Mixr headphones alongside an Apple iPhone 5, as Apple will make the most expensive acquisition in its history, after confirming a deal to buy Dr Dre's Beats Electronics for 3 billion dollars (&pound;1.78 billion).

Now, Tile has been acquired family tracking company Life360 for $205 million in a move that could give it the resources to better contend with rivals. It will continue to operate with the same branding under current Tile CEO CJ Prober, Life360 <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/life360-to-acquire-tile-creating-the-world-leader-in-finding-and-location-solutions-301430364.html">announced</a>.</p><p>Life360 said the acquisition will help it expand beyond family tracking to letting people &quot;locate the people, pets, and things they love.&quot; It noted that the addition of Life360&#39;s 33 million smartphone users will increase the reach of Tile&#39;s Finding Network by around 10x.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, Life360 will gain access to consumers in 27,000 retail stores where Tile trackers are sold. Tile&#39;s technology is also used in over a million third-party devices, ranging from wireless earphones to dog collars. The company will also acquire Tile&#39;s subscribers, boosting its total paid subscriber base by 45 percent to 1.6 million users.</p><p>The company emphasized that both Life360 and Tile are &quot;platform agnostic,&quot; working on both iOS and Android. The subtext is that Apple&#39;s AirTags only work on iOS, though Apple does have <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/03/airtag-privacy-improvements-sound-android-app/">plans</a> to introduce Android compatibility by year&#39;s end. Last year, Tile <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tile-apple-european-commission-antitrust-143303005.html">filed an EU complaint</a> against Apple for alleged anticompetitive behavior, claiming the iOS 13.5 update made its app harder to use.&nbsp;</p><p>There&#39;s certainly synergy between the companies, as Life360 has operated as a multi-platform &#39;Find My Friends&#39;-style service for years. Parents in the US, especially, have used the devices to keep track of their kids — so adding the ability to track objects and gadgets makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tile-to-be-acquired-by-family-location-sharing-service-life-360-103400952.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ace2f260-fc89-439a-9b32-367261314528</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 10:34:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637663641</ingested><modified>2021-11-23T10:34:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cdd18100-4c40-11ec-be7a-030bc674b5e8" width="1500" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cdd18100-4c40-11ec-be7a-030bc674b5e8" width="1500" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tile to be acquired by Life360 for $205 million]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ Tile to be acquired by Life360 for $205 million]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dodge to phase out its Challenger and Charger muscle cars in shift towards EVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dodge is phasing out its gas-powered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-dodge-charger-r-t-125300079.html">Charger</a> and Challenger muscle cars by 2024 in favor of electric muscle cars, <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/dodge-challenger-charger-dead-2024-ev-coming-soon/"><em>Motor Trend</em></a> has reported.

The first concept arriving in 2022 will be an electric muscle car, revealed in the next four or five months as a high-performance, drivable vehicle. The next model, a plug-in hybrid, will be a new car but not a Durango as some expected, according to Kuniskis.

For better or worse, no other creator in the gaming industry has pushed the medium closer to film than Kojima. And after hinting his studio <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-04-kojima-may-venture-filmmaking.html"><ins>could venture into filmmaking</ins></a>, it&#39;s doing precisely that.&nbsp;</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-11-22-kojima-productions-launches-new-film-tv-and-music-division"><em><ins>GamesIndustry.Biz</ins></em></a>, Kojima Productions has established a division dedicated to music, TV and film that will operate out of Los Angeles. Riley Russell, a former Sony Interactive executive, will lead the unit as it attempts to expand the cultural footprint of Kojima Productions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="532628924b594aa2b4fd4f66c4f1e6e5"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:75%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S3nzuv87ik4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>&quot;The new division will be tasked with working with creative and talented professionals in television, music and film, as well as the more familiar games industry,&quot; Russell told the outlet. &quot;The team has as its charter, the goal of expanding the reach and awareness of the properties now under development at Kojima Productions, and to make them even more a part of our popular culture.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s not surprising to see Kojima Productions expand beyond games. Kojima is known for his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-death-stranding-is-a-great-movie.html">film-like approach</a> to making games, and if you <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1462586580023922689?s=20">follow him on Twitter</a>, you&#39;ll know he frequently tweets about his favorite albums and movies. The question now becomes how the studio plans to handle the expansion. Since reforming in 2015, Kojima Productions has released one game. You can push that number to two if you count the recent Director&#39;s<a href="https://www.engadget.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-trailer-release-date-220511148.html"> Cut</a> release of <em>Death Stranding</em> as a separate title. What would a film adaptation of <em>Death Stranding</em> look like? For that matter, what would an adaptation of any Kojima game look like? We may just find out soon enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kojima-productions-film-music-tv-division-183631759.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f9ce52fb-4426-4f75-b515-745f62affc54</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 2021 18:36:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637605794</ingested><modified>2021-11-22T18:29:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/772b6760-4bc0-11ec-9fb7-b1eceb6cc104" width="4450" height="3091" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/772b6760-4bc0-11ec-9fb7-b1eceb6cc104" width="4450" height="3091" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mike Blake / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Japanese video game designer, Hideo Kojima of Kojima Productions Co., Ltd. is introduced by the Sony Corporation during their PlayStation 4 E3 2016 event in Los Angeles, California, U.S. June 13, 2016.
