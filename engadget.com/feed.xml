The latest title to slip to 2022 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-re-verse-announcement-225722341.html"><em><ins>Resident Evil Re:Verse</ins></em></a>, the upcoming multiplayer take on the horror franchise. What stands out with this delay, however, is that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/capcom"><ins>Capcom</ins></a> is putting the release date on ice only a week or two before the game was supposed to drop.</p><p>&quot;The previously announced July 2021 launch of <em>Resident Evil Re:Verse</em> is being moved to 2022 so that the team can continue working to deliver a smooth gameplay experience,&quot; the Resident Evil crew <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1415642321157230592"><ins>wrote in a tweet</ins></a>. &quot;We will share updated launch details at a later time. Thank you for your patience and understanding.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Re:Verse</em> was announced as a freebie for those who own <em>Resident Evil Village</em>. Capcom <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1415642323132747781"><ins>suggested</ins></a> those who have a physical copy of <em>Village </em>keep their <em>Re:Verse </em>download code in a safe place or add it to their account so they&#39;re ready to roll when the game finally drops.</p><div id="efaa1a4a01774fffb8dc607ada062801"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For players who purchased a physical version of Resident Evil Village, we recommend that you keep track of the included Resident Evil Re:Verse download code or add it to your account now so that you are ready to play when the game launches next year.</p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1415642323132747781?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 15, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p><em>Re:Verse</em> is effectively a separate deathmatch mode in which between four and six players pick a Resident Evil character and duke it out in short battles. When you die, you return as a zombie. The player with the most points after five minutes wins.</p><p>Game development is a complex process where all manner of things can go wrong.

Pushing back <em>Re:Verse </em>by at least six months at the last minute is a curious case, though. A lengthy delay indicates the game isn&#39;t close to being ready despite the July release window.</p><p>Although it&#39;s an add on for a main-series Resident Evil game, the delay will be disappointing to those who were looking forward to <em>Re:Verse</em>. Still, it&#39;s better to have a game that arrives late and works properly from the jump rather than one that needs months of post-launch hotfixes and larger patches <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cyberpunk-2077-crash-fixes-patch-1-23-023151901.html"><ins>to squish bugs</ins></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-reverse-delay-2022-capcom-141931770.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">76845c5a-369d-4fbf-8272-96e187c9bc55</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 14:19:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626358773</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T14:19:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/932ddc50-e576-11eb-af9d-5c4b00a8a1c9" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/932ddc50-e576-11eb-af9d-5c4b00a8a1c9" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Capcom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Resident Evil Re:Verse]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Resident Evil Re:Verse]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lyft's shared rides return with COVID measures and advanced booking]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lyft unsurprisingly axed shared rides as COVID-19 took hold, but it&#39;s rethinking them as the pandemic (hopefully) subsides and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-lyft-surge-pricing-lack-of-drivers-035835230.html">demand resumes</a>. The company is <a href="https://www.lyft.com/blog/posts/lyft-revamps-shared-rides-with-new-experience-for-riders-and-drivers">relaunching</a> shared rides on July 19th with a few tweaks to both streamline your trips and acknowledge the safety issues of a not-quite-normal US.</p><p>You can now request these rides up to 30 minutes in advance, saving you money and increasing the chances that you&#39;ll get an optimized route. There also won&#39;t be any surprise route changes or delays if you choose the &quot;no surprise pickups&quot; options — you won&#39;t be late for work because someone hailed a ride at the &#39;wrong&#39; moment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1dfcd9a0-e570-11eb-b3fd-426f4c244611" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Lyft shared rides scheduled in advance" data-uuid="1c8599f4-665e-3885-b386-de4c6a368602"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Lyft</div></figure><p>And yes, you&#39;ll still have to abide by some pandemic safety restrictions. Everyone in the car will still have to wear masks, and there will be no more than two passengers (both in the back seats). You can&#39;t eat or drink, either. If anyone violates the rules, both the driver and passengers can cancel a ride without penalty.</p><p>In some ways, this is as much about coping with Lyft&#39;s practical realities as anything. With ridership picking  back up, Lyft is facing a shortage of drivers. The shared option could help Lyft keep up while it recruits more drivers, especially among cost-conscious travellers who don&#39;t mind some socially distanced company.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lyft-shared-rides-return-133317382.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9094baf7-fafc-43af-86d9-581f5bfb8c27</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 13:33:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626355999</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T13:33:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3031e610-e56b-11eb-bfbb-d230d7a53069" width="8192" height="5464" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3031e610-e56b-11eb-bfbb-d230d7a53069" width="8192" height="5464" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[alvarez via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mixed race woman with protective face mask travel by taxi.

It&#39;s all about creating a &quot;social space&quot; accentuated by the three driving modes, two of which (Autonomy and Rest) don&#39;t require you to drive at all.

The company has <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/integrate-facebook-pay-directly-into-business-website">announced</a> plans to break out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-facebook-pay-unification-whatsapp-instagram.html">Facebook Pay</a> from its own ecosystem to facilitate transactions across the web. Starting in August, US-based customers will be able to make purchases from Shopify-powered businesses using the payment method. When you visit a supported seller, you&#39;ll see a Facebook Pay button allowing you to complete a purchase with your saved card or PayPal details.&nbsp;</p><p>In that sense, Facebook will be jostling for attention at checkout with rival mobile and digital wallets including Apple Pay and Google Pay. Of course, each has a built-in audience based on preferred hardware, operating system or, in Facebook&#39;s case, social network.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Until now, Facebook Pay has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-12-facebook-pay.html">limited</a> to the company&#39;s own platforms including Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp. Facebook has pitched it as an expedient way to shop on those apps, split the bill with friends, send money abroad and donate to charities. Expanding Facebook Pay&#39;s reach across the web not only boosts its convenience, but also fits into the company&#39;s wider ecommerce strategy. In June, Facebook added support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-qr-codes-payments-213052047.html">QR codes</a> to the payments platform, enabling users to send money to people outside of their friends group.&nbsp;</p><p>At the same time, it has integrated shopping features into its wider ecosystem of social apps to capitalize on the shift to ecommerce. In May, Facebook introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-new-shopping-features-171051648.html">Shops</a> that turn business pages on its main platform and Instagram into online storefronts. Like Google and Snapchat before it, the company is also turning to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-visual-search-instagram-shopping-190323553.html">visual search</a> to help people discover more shoppable products on Instagram. Not to be left out, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-shopping-button-152011215.html">WhatsApp</a> also received a shopping button that let users browse a retailer&#39;s product catalog.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-pay-online-stores-121041167.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b2798917-7255-4420-8424-d9e31cdb4384</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 12:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626349016</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T11:37:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/dbfe5e30-e55a-11eb-bbbf-543e1934722c" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/dbfe5e30-e55a-11eb-bbbf-543e1934722c" width="2000" height="1136" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Pay]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Pay]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube makes subscriber-only chats and polls available to all streamers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube has boosted its features for gamers and live-streamers with <a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/117186067/availability-updates-for-clips-polls-subscribers-only-chat">three more features</a> borrowed from Twitch, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577574/youtube-twitch-features-subscriber-sub-only-chat-polls-clips"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported.

Developed by researchers at <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2021/07/420946/neuroprosthesis-restores-words-man-paralysis">UC San Francisco</a>, the technique is a more natural way for people with speech loss to communicate than other methods <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-brain-implants-help-paralyzed-type-faster.html">we&#39;ve seen</a> to date.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, neuroprosthetic technology has only allowed paralyzed users to type out just one letter at a time, a process that can be slow and laborious. It also tapped parts of the brain that control the arm or hand, a system that&#39;s not necessarily intuitive for the subject.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The USCF system, however, uses an implant that&#39;s placed directly on the part of the brain dedicated to speech. That way, the subject can mentally activate the brain patterns they would normally use to say a word, and the system can translate the entire word, rather than single letters, to the screen.&nbsp;</p><p>To make it work, patients with normal speech volunteered to have their brain recordings analyzed for speech related activities. Researchers were then able to analyze those patterns and develop new methods to decode them in real time, using statistical language models to improve accuracy.&nbsp;</p><div id="9dc1b71b29ca4459a6eefda9c48dd6ee"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GMcf1fXdW8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>However, the team still wasn&#39;t sure if brain signals controlling the vocal tract would still be intact in patients paralyzed for many years. To that end, they enlisted an anonymous participant (known as Bravo1) who worked with researchers to create a 50-word vocabulary that the team could decipher using advanced computer algorithms. That included words like &quot;water,&quot; &quot;family&quot; and &quot;good,&quot; enough to allow the patient to create hundreds of sentences applicable to their daily life. The team also used an &quot;auto-correct&quot; function similar to those found on consumer speech recognition apps.&nbsp;</p><p>To test the system, the team asked patient Bravo1 to reply to questions like &quot;How are you today?&quot; and &quot;Would you like some water?&quot; The patient&#39;s attempted speech then appeared on the screen as &quot;I am very good,&quot; and &quot;No, I am not thirsty.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>The system was able to decode their speech at up to 18 words per minute with 93 percent accuracy, with a 75 percent median accuracy. That might not sound great compared to the 200 words per minute possible with normal speech, but it&#39;s much better than the speeds seen on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-brain-implants-help-paralyzed-type-faster.html">previous neuroprosthetic systems</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“To our knowledge, this is the first successful demonstration of direct decoding of full words from the brain activity of someone who is paralyzed and cannot speak,” said Edward Chang, MD,  Chair of Neurological Surgery at UCSF and senior author on the study. “It shows strong promise to restore communication by tapping into the brain&#39;s natural speech machinery.”</p><p>The team said the trial represents a proof of principal for this new type of &quot;speech neuroprosthesis.&quot; Next up, they plan to expand the trial to include more participants, while also working to increase the number of words in the vocabulary and improve the rate of speech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/severely-paralyzed-man-communicates-using-brain-signals-sent-to-his-vocal-tract-110524126.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">788eefc6-08c2-4fe2-b7be-694819d33ec7</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 11:05:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626345334</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T10:35:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Career & Education]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ae215810-e54f-11eb-b333-df8fd83ee8ec" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ae215810-e54f-11eb-b333-df8fd83ee8ec" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[UCSF]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Severely paralyzed man communicates using brain signals sent to his vocal tract]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Severely paralyzed man communicates using brain signals sent to his vocal tract]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's SmartThings app can now track your energy usage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung is catering its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/smartthings">SmartThings</a> app updates to our changing lifestyles.

The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) is <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Newsroom/News-Releases/2021/CPSC-Sues-Amazon-to-Force-Recall-of-Hazardous-Products-Sold-on-Amazon-com">suing</a> the online retailer to force it to recall faulty items that pose safety risks to shoppers. In the filing, regulators said they had warned Amazon about the hazardous items on its site, but deemed its response insufficient.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the CPSC, the faulty goods included 24,000 carbon monoxide detectors that failed to alarm, 400,000 hair dryers that lacked electrocution safeguards and children&#39;s sleepwear that could catch fire. The commission voted by 3-1 to approve the legal complaint to compel Amazon to recall the named products, notify customers who purchased them and offer full refunds.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As stated in the <a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/s3fs-public/pdfs/recall/lawsuits/abc/001-In-re-Amazon-com-Inc__.pdf?TvLLxHy1UMfiz3BpfXaKjQy1ibQbYAiU">lawsuit</a>, the retailer has already taken some of those actions. Amazon removed the identification numbers for the specified products, the CPSC said. The company also informed consumers who had purchased the goods that they could present a hazard and offered to compensate them with gift cards credited to their account, the regulator noted. But, the CPSC insisted that Amazon&#39;s &quot;unilateral&quot; response was insufficient.</p><p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-regulator-sues-amazon-demands-recall-hazardous-products-2021-07-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a>, Amazon said it was &quot;unclear&quot; why the CPSC rejected its offer to expand its recall program, including for products sold by third parties, or sued to force actions &quot;almost entirely duplicative&quot; of those it had taken. The retailer added that it had removed &quot;the vast majority&quot; of the products in question from its store and provided full customer refunds.</p><p>“Today’s vote to file an administrative complaint against Amazon was a huge step forward for this small agency,” said the CPSC acting chairman Robert Adler. “But it’s a huge step across a vast desert—we must grapple with how to deal with these massive third-party platforms more efficiently, and how best to protect the American consumers who rely on them.”</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Amazon has been lambasted for its distribution of hazardous items. Last year, a <em>CNN</em> investigation into customer reviews on the site<em>&nbsp;</em>found 70 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-basics-products-could-be-fire-safety-risk-214942687.html">AmazonBasics</a> items had been associated with fires. A 2019 report by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> also claimed that Amazon was selling more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-basics-products-could-be-fire-safety-risk-214942687.html">4,000 items</a> that federal agencies had declared unsafe, prompting<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-29-senators-amazon-unsafe-products-letter.html"> Senators to write to then CEO Jeff Bezos </a>for answers.&nbsp;</p><p>Last fall, a California state appeals court ruled that Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-liable-defective-thirdparty-products-135528763.html">can be held liable</a> for damages and injuries caused by faulty products sold on its third-party marketplace.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cpsc-amazon-lawsuit-hazardous-products-091349726.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">94dc119f-411c-4432-8c84-ccca59e14a56</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 09:13:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626340431</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T09:14:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/316bb6b0-e54c-11eb-af34-55c9c115b936" width="3229" height="2153" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/316bb6b0-e54c-11eb-af34-55c9c115b936" width="3229" height="2153" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An Amazon delivery worker pulls a delivery cart full of packages during its annual Prime Day promotion in New York City, U.S., June 21, 2021.

The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/amplitube5cs/">AmpliTube modeling software</a> offers the ability to use popular effects, amps and cabinets via digital modeling rather than the hardware itself. But the app resides on computer <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/irigstompio/?pkey=irig-stomp-io">or tablet</a>, so it&#39;s not exactly the most convenient thing to take on the road. Today, IK Multimedia is debuting the AmpliTube X-GEAR line: a collection of four guitar pedals equipped with versions of the same effects available on the robust desktop software.&nbsp;</p><p>The AmpliTube X-GEAR pedals offer options for distortion (X-DRIVE), modulation (X-VIBE), delay (X-TIME) and reverb (X-SPACE). All four pedals are loaded with 16 different effects and IK Multimedia developed new algorithms for both reverb and delay. The company says that despite giving users a different set of tools, each of the X-GEAR devices uses the same hardware and digital signal processing (DSP).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/38514d80-e50d-11eb-aaf3-19d06510fb75" style="height:1298;width:1600;" alt="IK Multimedia AmpliTube X-GEAR" data-uuid="25bf4733-6eca-3998-a9cd-3393c024b808"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IK Multimedia</div></figure><p>Because these are based on powerful software, IK Multimedia says the X-GEAR pedals work well in both the studio and on stage. With the desktop app (AmpliTube SE is included with the pedals), you can make changes and save settings, including up to 300 presets, back to the hardware pedal as needed. Thanks to up to 192kHz internal processing and oversampling, the company says the X-GEAR pedals can give you the same &quot;realism and response&quot; as AmpliTube on the desktop.</p><p>Each X-GEAR pedal is housed in an aluminum shell with 24-bit/192kHz converters to keep noise at a minimum and 5Hz–24kHz frequency response. IK Multimedia says the frequency response combined with an analog dry path and selectable true or soft bypass will allow your guitar&#39;s tone to come through unfiltered. When it&#39;s time to record, the X-GEAR pedals can serve as a USB interface with a digital audio workstation (DAW). You can select between wet or dry signals, use a stereo output for monitoring and employ full MIDI compatibility. On stage, pair any item in the X-GEAR lineup with an expression pedal and you&#39;ll get even more control of each of the parameters on board. There are also five cabinet options on each pedal so you can connect them directly to a PA if needed.&nbsp;</p><p>The X-GEAR pedals go on sale in August for $300 each, but you can pre-order them now <a href="https://www.ikmultimedia.com/products/xgear/">from the company&#39;s website</a>. That price puts IK Multimedia&#39;s latest gear just below multi-effects options like <a href="https://www.strymon.net/product-category/effects-pedals/">Strymon&#39;s BlueSky and Mobius pedals</a>. A key difference though is that IK Multimedia is known for mobile audio interfaces, MIDI controllers and software plug-ins while companies like Strymon are well-respected in the guitar world thanks to their established track records. This is really the first time IK Multimedia has built what many would consider &quot;real&quot; effects pedals, so it will be interesting to see if the company successfully leveraged its software expertise for this new hardware.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="242bea21-4079-4db3-8c66-3752382d8c0d"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ik-multimedia-amplitube-x-gear-pedals-073045987.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ccb8cad3-4848-4076-ab77-48fe317d576d</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 07:30:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626314132</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T01:55:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/71e50110-e506-11eb-bbcd-dbb3c6044d25" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/71e50110-e506-11eb-bbcd-dbb3c6044d25" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IK Multimedia]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[IK Multimedia AmpliTube X-GEAR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IK Multimedia AmpliTube X-GEAR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Delta pilot sues the airline for allegedly stealing an app he designed]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-08-delta-computer-system-meltdown.html">Delta</a> pilot has sued the airline for $1 billion, accusing it of trade secrets theft over a communications app he developed a few years ago. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/delta-pilot-sues-airline-for-1-billion-claiming-stolen-crew-app"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Captain Craig Alexander pitched the QrewLive app, which he reportedly developed with $100,000 of his own money, to the company as a way for crew to easily communicate in case of disrupted flights. However, Delta turned him down and then launched what he says is an identical tool a few years later.</p><p>Alexander apparently contacted Delta CEO Ed Bastian back in 2016 after a computer system meltdown put <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-08-delta-computer-system-meltdown.html">all flights on hold</a> and cost the company over $150 million. He told the CEO that he had a solution for issues like that, which resulted in several meetings with executives who <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/business/pilot-files-intellectual-property-lawsuit-against-delta/YM3GFTE3UNFOJMXOEWGUMYQIN4/">gave him</a> verbal assurances that they were going to acquire his app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to Alexander&#39;s complaint, Delta ended up telling him that his technology didn&#39;t fit its needs and ultimately launched its own Flight Family Communications app in 2018. He called the official Delta app a &quot;carbon copy, knock-off of the role-based text messaging component of [his] proprietary QrewLive communications platform.&quot; As for how he decided to seek $1 billion in damages, he said it&#39;s &quot;based solely upon operational cost savings to Delta, [which] conservatively exceeds $1 billion.&quot;</p><p>The plaintiff has been with the airline for 11 years and still currently works with the company. Delta spokesperson Morgan Durrant told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a statement: &quot;While we take the allegations specified in Mr. Alexander&#39;s complaint seriously, they are not an accurate or fair description of Delta&#39;s development of its internal crew messaging platform.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/delta-pilot-sues-airline-app-063637349.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc54dfb2-9b56-4fab-8735-125708018c07</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 06:36:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626355619</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T13:27:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98ff79d0-e531-11eb-bfdf-b17a4cea27fd" width="4256" height="2482" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/98ff79d0-e531-11eb-bfdf-b17a4cea27fd" width="4256" height="2482" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mindaugas Dulinskas via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Narita, Japan - January 25, 2017: N674US Boeing 747 Delta Air Lines Landing in International Narita Airport, Japan.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[N674US Boeing 747 Delta Air Lines Landing in International Narita Airport, Japan.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix will reportedly offer video games within the next year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-exclusive-rights-universal-animated-films-105446842.html">Netflix</a> may be a TV show, movie <em>and</em> game streaming platform in the near future. According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/netflix-plans-to-offer-video-games-in-expansion-beyond-films-tv"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the company has hired Mike Verdu, a former Oculus and EA exec, as vice president of game development. Verdu was the VP of augmented and virtual reality games and content at Facebook, where he worked with developers for the Oculus Rift, Quest and Go. From 2017 to 2018, he was also the head of EA Mobile and oversaw the studios that worked on <em>Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</em>, <em>SimCity BuildIt</em>, <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> and <em>Sims Free Play</em>, among others.</p><p>The company will reportedly build out its gaming team in the coming months to be able to start offering games for streaming within the next year. Netflix isn&#39;t exactly inexperienced in the area and previously developed games based on its popular shows. However, it released those titles on mobile and consoles — <em>Bloomberg</em> says the company won&#39;t be making a separate platform for its upcoming video games and will instead make them available alongside its shows and movies under their own category. Also, the streaming giant reportedly has no plans to charge extra for game access, though it&#39;s unclear if the additional content will lead to a future price hike.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With competitors popping up left and right, Netflix has been looking for ways to grow and make sure it stays ahead, especially in saturated markets like the US. Adding video games to its repertoire seems to be the answer it came up with recently. <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/netflix-seeks-executive-to-expand-game-efforts"><em>The Information</em></a> first reported that the company was seeking to hire an executive who&#39;d oversee its expansion into video games back in May. Apparently, Netflix approached several veteran execs in the industry regarding the position. Back then, a company spokesperson told <em>The Information</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Our members value the variety and quality of our content. It&#39;s why we&#39;ve continually expanded our offering— from series to documentaries, film, local language originals and reality TV.

It’s also possible to mirror the screen on your iOS device. With HomeKit, meanwhile, you can control your TV using Siri or the Home app on iOS and macOS. Using voice commands, it’s possible to turn the TV on and off, as well as adjust the volume and control playback.</p><p>To take advantage of that latter functionality, you’ll need to dig into the settings menu on your TV, navigate to the “Display and Sounds” section and select “AirPlay and HomeKit.” From there, follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup process. If all you want to do is use AirPlay, you don’t have to do anything special; the feature is enabled by default after installing the new software.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toshiba-insignia-fire-tv-airplay-2-homekit-update-013526800.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">860cf3b2-c7ff-4058-a1da-0ebdc8b42ce5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 01:35:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626303284</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T22:54:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8ccb4520-e4d9-11eb-bf77-a33a47efdb54" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8ccb4520-e4d9-11eb-bf77-a33a47efdb54" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toshiba]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Toshiba 4K UHD Fire TV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Toshiba 4K UHD Fire TV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Teenage Engineering's OP-1 synth update brings USB audio streaming 10 years after release]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Ten years after its initial release, Teenage Engineering still finds ways to surprise and delight with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-09-27-teenage-engineering-op-1-synthesizer-gets-priced-at-799-cant.html"><ins>OP-1</ins></a>.

That&#39;s about to change, and eventually you&#39;ll no longer need to have a phone nearby to use WhatsApp on the web, macOS, Windows or Portal.</p><p>Starting today, WhatsApp will invite users to try its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-multi-device-support-soon-132418897.html"><ins>multi-device beta</ins></a>. You&#39;ll be able to use the service on your phone and up to four other devices (as long as they also aren&#39;t phones). WhatsApp will try the multi-device approach with a small group of people from its beta program. They&#39;ll be able to opt out of the beta later. With the help of those users, WhatsApp will optimize the multi-device experience and add some more features before rolling it out more broadly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Although many users have been requesting multi-device support, it&#39;s taken WhatsApp some time to make that happen. It has built a system that retains end-to-end encryption while letting people sync data like contact names, archives and starred messages across devices.</p><p>Until now, the WhatsApp smartphone app has been an essential conduit for the service. Other platforms like the web and desktop apps maintain a consistent, secure link to the phone app and mirror the content. But if your phone battery dies or there&#39;s an issue with the smartphone app, you can&#39;t use WhatsApp on other platforms.</p><p>Through the multi-device beta, each device will have its own identity key. Currently, users have a single identity key (i.e. the one on their phone) to handle encrypted messages. WhatsApp has <a href="https://scontent.whatsapp.net/v/t39.8562-34/217392192_617386875906350_2307693746154839727_n.pdf/WhatsApp_Security_Whitepaper_V4_Preview.pdf?ccb=1-3&amp;_nc_sid=2fbf2a&amp;_nc_ohc=4NBatF5TfzwAX-aVLCC&amp;_nc_oc=AQmcb-mK8YRXFKR50jznycD5iL0Wr-cAEL2STU9EfokAGZIq6Fn9thP2YmymlwHht6o&amp;_nc_ht=scontent.whatsapp.net&amp;oh=e9995b3578767e0defaf6163c8a1424e&amp;oe=60F4C687">developed systems</a> it says will keep out eavesdroppers who try to add devices to a user&#39;s account and to minimize the number of times people need to confirm their identity across devices. You&#39;ll also have control over connected devices and see which ones are linked to your account.</p><p>Along with messages, WhatsApp will have E2EE support for voice and video calls as part of the multi-device beta. There won&#39;t be any impact on the way WhatsApp handles cloud backups.&nbsp;</p><p>Solving the issue of supporting E2EE across a user&#39;s devices can be tricky given that only devices that messages are sent to and from are supposed to be able to decrypt them. Apple seems to have found an answer — iMessage supports E2EE across Apple devices. Although Telegram works on multiple devices, its E2EE approach (Secret Chats) <a href="https://tsf.telegram.org/manuals/e2ee-simple"><ins>does not currently do so</ins></a>. Like WhatsApp&#39;s current setup, Signal&#39;s desktop app also needs to <a href="https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360008216551-Installing-Signal&#92;">connect to a smartphone</a> to send and receive messages.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-phone-multi-device-end-to-end-encryption-192123565.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60c61ae4-bbfb-48a7-ad18-2c50b6dbefde</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 19:21:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626290557</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T19:22:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e9424220-e4d6-11eb-bdee-3947bb2fcd59" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e9424220-e4d6-11eb-bdee-3947bb2fcd59" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[WhatsApp]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WhatsApp multi-device beta]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[WhatsApp multi-device beta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter removed a lot more abusive content in the second half of 2020 than ever before]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is getting better at moderating its platform. That’s one of the main takeaways from the company’s most <a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/an-update-to-the-twitter-transparency-center"><ins>recent transparency report</ins></a>, which it shared on Wednesday.  Between July 1st and December 31st, 2020, Twitter says it took action against 964,459 accounts for abusive behavior. Compared to the first six months of 2020, that’s a 142 percent increase. Over the same timeframe, Twitter also removed more hateful content. On that front, the company says it took action against 1,126,990 accounts, a 77 percent increase from the 635,415 accounts it reprimanded in the first half of 2020.</p><p>What’s notable here is that the company attributes the latter increase to policy changes it put in place throughout 2020. Specifically, it calls out the fact that it began taking action on &quot;content that incites fear and/or fearful stereotypes about protected categories&quot; as a result of an uptick in harassment during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also calls out an expansion of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-hate-speech-rules-race-ethnicity-194849330.html">hateful conduct policy</a> in early December that saw the company prohibit language that “dehumanizes” people based on their race, ethnicity or national origin. Not mentioned in the report — but likely still something that had a positive effect — is the ban the company put in place in July against links to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bans-links-hateful-conduct-violence-010623900.html"><ins>content that promotes violence and hateful conduct</ins></a>.</p><p>In another part of the report, Twitter also attributes its recent success to better technology. As of the second half of last year, the company claims its automated moderation tools helped it take action against 65 percent of abusive tweets and other behavior before someone had to flag the content for its moderators. To put that percentage in perspective, those tools were about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-twitter-says-better-spotting-abusive-tweets-than-users.html"><ins>50 percent effective</ins></a> by late 2019.</p><p>Obviously, Twitter has yet to completely stop abuse, harassment and hate speech from taking place on its platform, but today’s report shows the company is at least making progress on its 2019 promise to “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-05-twitter-jack-dorsey-public-square-health.html"><ins>increase the health of public conversation</ins></a>.”&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-second-half-2020-transparency-report-184953614.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">45e4cd13-e7a9-452f-90d1-11a68da11289</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 18:49:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626288596</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T18:50:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1457de20-e4d2-11eb-bb9d-f9d09caf80c1" width="3110" height="1949" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1457de20-e4d2-11eb-bb9d-f9d09caf80c1" width="3110" height="1949" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

Safari is getting some design updates, including easier access to reloading, sharing and Tab Groups in macOS Monterey, as well as improved navigation features in iOS 15.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the changes in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html#safari">macOS Monterey beta that we didn&#39;t like</a> was the removal of the tabs bar. Senior editor Devindra Hardawar pointed out that while the new menu in its place allowed Apple to devote more screen space to website content, it made sorting through your tabs messy and tedious. With today&#39;s beta release, though, Apple&#39;s brought back the standalone Tab bar, which will be enabled by default, like it was on Big Sur.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, you&#39;ll also get one-click access to controls including Reload and Sharing, as well as access to new features like Tab Groups from the toolbar. If you liked the thin menu that gave you more space for browsing, you can still adopt it, and Apple&#39;s refined this to make it easier to see page titles while you rack up more tabs.</p><p>These changes will also come to iPadOS in a future beta update, which is nice since deputy editor Nathan Ingraham <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-os-15-public-beta-preview-191514417.html#safari">also criticized the removal of the tab bar in our preview</a>.</p><p>On iOS 15, Apple&#39;s tweaked Safari to make it easier to use with one hand. When you&#39;re entering a search, the field will now appear on top of the keyboard so it&#39;s nearer the bottom of the screen, making it easier to edit your query. When you&#39;re done typing, you can dismiss the keyboard by swiping down on it. Apple also added a Reload option to the long-press menu on the left side of the tab bar.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven&#39;t already, you can enroll in Apple&#39;s beta program to check these previews out for yourself. But be warned, you&#39;ll need to be sure you want to risk running potentially unstable software. If you can&#39;t wait a bit longer for the stable release, make sure you back up your data before installing the updates.

While the feature is still in development, there likely won&#39;t be a way for all players to join the same lobbies.</p><p>During an upcoming invite-only technical playtest, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and PC players will be able to hop into games together. DICE is planning to split the player pool between gamers on those platforms and those on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. PC and console players can opt out from playing against each other, which might soothe concerns about the disparity between controllers and mouse and keyboard.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Dividing players between console generations might come as a disappointment to some, especially for those with friends who don&#39;t have a decent gaming rig or haven’t been able to snag a PS5 or Xbox Series X/S. However, it makes sense. The PS4 and Xbox One versions <a href="https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-video-details-151958457.html">will have smaller lobbies</a> than on PC and current consoles, with 64 players instead of 128, as well as slightly condensed maps. Gameplay will otherwise be the same on all platforms, including weather events like tornados.</p><p>Cross-progression is in the works too. Your progress and items (including ones you buy) will carry over from one platform to another, so if you hop between PC and PlayStation or Xbox, you’ll have access to all of your gear.</p><p>Elsewhere, DICE plans to use bots to fill out lobbies when needed to improve matchmaking and perhaps get you into matches faster. You can&#39;t opt out from using the bots, though players will always have priority over AI soldiers. If a player leaves mid-game, a bot will take over until someone else joins.&nbsp;</p><p>The bots should act in a similar way to human players, though they won&#39;t be able to use wingsuits or class-based abilities. The AI soldiers can carry out other tasks, like reviving teammates, calling in vehicles and capturing objectives. You’ll be able to battle bots in solo and co-op modes too.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/battlefield-briefing-answering-your-reveal-questions">a blog post</a> covering these tidbits, DICE and EA spilled the beans about some other features, including vehicles, fully customizable loadouts and how different modes focus on certain areas of maps. Meanwhile, DICE said you won&#39;t be able to fight on every floor of a skyscraper, only the lobby and rooftop. More details about <em>Battlefield 2042 </em>will be revealed at the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-play-live-spotlight-series-223554077.html">EA Play Live event</a> on July 22nd.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-2042-cross-play-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x-pc-174805910.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0b8be361-d8a9-4024-b722-baf16775e142</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2021 17:48:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626290786</ingested><modified>2021-07-14T19:26:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3398290-c943-11eb-adbf-3bda51b8d5b9" width="640" height="360" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/c3398290-c943-11eb-adbf-3bda51b8d5b9" width="640" height="360" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA / DICE]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[RendeZook]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[RendeZook]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clubhouse unveils its new 'Backchannel' DM feature]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Clubhouse, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-launches-its-clubhouse-live-audio-rival-greenroom-130034550.html">oft</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-launches-audio-rooms-and-podcasts-110028076.html">cloned</a> invite-only <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-is-clubhouse-app-130015640.html">audio chat platform</a> that recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-clubhouse-android-app-is-now-available-worldwide-082506070.html">expanded to Android</a>, has since its inception lacked a seemingly fundamental feature present on virtually every other social media app: the ability to directly message other users.
