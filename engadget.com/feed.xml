But of course, like most other Apple accessories, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-battery-pack-175601349.html">palm-sized battery</a> is expensive, coming in at $99. But Amazon has the pack for the lowest price we&#39;ve seen it right now — only $75, or 24 percent off its normal price. Now&#39;s a good opportunity to grab it if you&#39;ve been eyeing it for a while for your own iPhone, or you need a stocking stuffer for an iPhone user in your life.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xKTxhQ" id="4e74ed1faee84cf99e1bb59d07c9ff10" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MagSafe battery pack at Amazon - $75</a><p>Like all MagSafe accessories, this battery pack is designed to snap onto the back of your iPhone and it&#39;ll automatically start charging the handset once attached. It fits neatly onto the backside of even the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13 mini</a>, so you can still easily use your phone with one hand while powering up. If you plug in the battery pack while charging your iPhone, you&#39;ll get up to 15W of power and you could get even faster charging when you pair your Lightning cable with an adapter higher than 20W. Plus, you&#39;ll be able to keep track of your phone&#39;s and the battery pack&#39;s recharge on your iPhone&#39;s lock screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s pretty tempting (and often convenient) to go for Apple&#39;s own accessories, but you can often find similar, more affordable options elsewhere. While the number of MagSafe-compatible gadgets is growing, there are still only a few battery packs made by reputable brands. Anker makes two 5,000mAh magnetic power packs, a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:standard one" href="https://amzn.to/3luk3qN">standard one</a> and a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:newer MagGo model" href="https://amzn.to/3ofoHuA">newer MagGo model</a> that has a built-in, foldable kickstand, so you can prop up your iPhone while charging. Belkin also makes a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:10,000mAh battery" href="https://amzn.to/3ogFQ7b">10,000mAh battery</a> that works as a magnetic charger and a portable power bank. We haven&#39;t tested any of these alternatives yet, but both Anker and Belkin have a good track record when it comes to mobile accessories — plus, all three battery packs come in between $50 and $60 each, making them even better options for those with tight budgets.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-magsafe-battery-pack-is-24-percent-off-at-amazon-141038263.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">777585d1-601b-4cf5-93c1-2858d0bd9004</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 14:10:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638453006</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T13:50:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a4f836d0-e402-11eb-b77f-32ac984a1efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a4f836d0-e402-11eb-b77f-32ac984a1efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 12 MagSafe Battery Pack]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 12 MagSafe Battery Pack]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook will force users at risk of being hacked to enable two-factor authentication]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook has taken steps to ensure that users most at risk of being hacked don&#39;t lose their accounts to bad actors. The social network has updated its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-security-monitoring-two-factor-keys-152613046.html">Protect program</a> that was designed to provide extra security features to human rights activists, politicians, journalists and other at-risk users. In a press call with reporters, Facebook announced that it&#39;ll start requiring users part of the program to switch on two-factor authentication.&nbsp;</p><p>The website will start implementing the new rule over the coming months all over the world — for members in the US, the requirement will take effect sometime in mid-to-late February. Facebook explained that it worked on making the enrollment and use of two-factor on its website &quot;as frictionless as possible for these groups of people by providing better user experience and support.&quot; It admitted that it may take time for all users to be able to comply with the new rule, since not everyone actively uses its platform. But Facebook and its parent company seem to be pleased with what they&#39;d seen in early testing.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta&#39;s head of security policy Nathaniel Gleicher said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;So far, it&#39;s actually going very, very well we&#39;re seeing well above 90% of people successfully enabling ahead of that mandatory period.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Facebook first tested Protect back in 2018 and offered it to American politicians ahead of the 2020 US Elections. It expanded the program&#39;s scope and opened it up to more users after that— in my case, I was locked out of my account until I activated it. The website is now on track to make the program available in more than 50 countries by the end of year, including the US and India, where <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/268136/top-15-countries-based-on-number-of-facebook-users/">most</a> of its users are based.</p><p>Gleicher said over 1.5 million users had enrolled in the program so far, and 950,000 had already switched on 2FA. He also said that 2FA is an underutilized feature on the platform, with only 4 percent of the website&#39;s monthly users enabling it. Even so, there are no plans to require people outside of the Protect program to switch it on.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-2-factor-140044867.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c1bee97b-3b00-4dc0-b281-396b5d8d0db8</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 14:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638444238</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T11:24:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b0815230-535a-11ec-8fff-39a5b893c699" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b0815230-535a-11ec-8fff-39a5b893c699" width="6240" height="4160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charnchai via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Businessman use cell phone and working on office desk and analyzing new project of accounting finance.

The company has partnered with artists, session players and others who created &quot;inspiring playable instrument loops, vocal hooks, one-shots, and soundscapes,&quot; along with a story behind the sounds. You can then use those samples in any way you like to create your own tracks.&nbsp;</p><p>Chromatic is as much about the interface as the capability, according to LANDR. It gives users access to content across genres of music through color-coded mood boards, so you can &quot;quickly audition or earmark individual sound sets&quot; and incorporate them into your workflow. At the same time, they&#39;re matched to the tempo and key of any project.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="60e2c6ea4c9749e3944f999a00466741"><p><a href="https://landr-1.wistia.com/medias/wodors0shs?wvideo=wodors0shs"><img src="https://embed-fastly.wistia.com/deliveries/592e26bb51ac15ee22036c2ebae43d35.jpg?image_play_button_size=2x&amp;image_crop_resized=960x408&amp;image_play_button=1&amp;image_play_button_color=0c1b2be0" width="400" height="170" style="width:400px;height:170px;"></a></p><p><a href="https://landr-1.wistia.com/medias/wodors0shs?wvideo=wodors0shs">Chromatic - landr-1</a></p></div><p>&quot;As an instrument, Chromatic lets you explore, play, and manipulate original sounds created by artists and producers, making them your own,&quot; says LANDR CEO Pascal Pilon in a statement. &quot;We&#39;ve developed Chromatic to bring the human element back into your virtual studio, a unique way to collaborate and engage with the creators of your favorite tracks and musical styles.&quot;</p><p>Artists who contribute the loops will receive royalties for when they&#39;re used. However, for certain specific artists and labels, LANDR will support splits on works created with their sound sets. &quot;With this unique arrangement, Chromatic will serve as a foundation for emerging producers to collaborate with featured artists, resulting in a split release and promotion of a new work made with their Chromatic content.&quot; This presumably means that Chromatic users would share royalties on commercial releases with select, high-profile loop creators.&nbsp;</p><p>Chromatic is LANDR&#39;s first instrument, and a move towards a trend of subscriptions toward virtual instruments. A recent example is Output, which recently unveiled a similar subscription-based product called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arcade-20-note-kits-instruments-sampler-hands-on-161548233.html">Arcade</a>. <a href="https://www.antarestech.com/product/auto-tune-unlimited/">Auto-Tune</a> also offers a subscription, and Splice <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splice-new-creator-plans-with-exclusive-plugins-and-educational-videos-123418413.html">recently launched</a> two vocal VST plugins that are behind subscription walls, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>Chromatic is <a href="https://www.landr.com/en/chromatic?utm_campaign=awareness_chromatic_en_us_pressrelease&amp;utm_medium=organic_referral&amp;utm_source=pr&amp;utm_content=rps&amp;utm_term=professionals">now available</a> as a free download with access to the full library of royalty-free sound sets at $10 per month. It&#39;s also offering an &quot;<a href="https://www.landr.com/en/pricing/">All Access Pass</a>&quot; at $10 per month for six months and $15 per month thereafter, with royalty-free access to the sample library, AI-assisted mastering, music distribution on sites like Spotify, Sessions collaboration and more.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/landrs-chromatic-lets-you-create-using-artist-generated-loops-140038379.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2ce76d47-50b9-4865-8c66-87034a0042d5</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 14:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638452699</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T13:45:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b694140-5372-11ec-96b7-b3cac4b9f94b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6b694140-5372-11ec-96b7-b3cac4b9f94b" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LANDR]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LANDR's Chromatic DAW app lets you create using artist-generated loops]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LANDR's Chromatic DAW app lets you create using artist-generated loops]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla is selling a $1,900 Cyberquad ATV for kids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-made-a-cyberwhistle-and-its-already-sold-out-101040559.html">Tesla</a> has <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberquad-for-kids">started selling the Cyberquad</a>, but it&#39;s not the ATV it previewed when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-22-cyberquad-electric-atv-cybertruck-tesla.html">unveiled</a> its electric truck in 2019. No, the Cybersquad you can now buy from the automaker&#39;s store is a much smaller version of the vehicle meant kids — and yes, it actually works.&nbsp;</p><p>The four-wheel ATV is powered by a lithium-ion battery and will run on electricity like its bigger version. It has 15 miles of range with a configurable top speed of 10mph, a full steel frame, a cushioned seat, adjustable suspension and LED light bars. In other words, it looks like a shrunken down version of a legit ATV.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A small Cyberquad will set you back $1,900 and is expected to start shipping within the next two to four weeks. But before you seriously start considering getting it as a gift for your kid this Christmas, know that Tesla says that orders aren&#39;t guaranteed to arrive before the holidays. Also, it&#39;s only currently available from Tesla&#39;s US shop and can only be shipped to continental United States.</p><p>We first saw a glimpse of the Cyberquad (the actual one for for adults) at the Cybertruck event, where it rode onto the back of the truck to show how its adaptive suspension enables easier loading.

Tesla yesterday launched <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-made-a-cyberwhistle-and-its-already-sold-out-101040559.html"><ins>Cyberwhistle</ins></a>, a $50 whistle designed with the same angular lines as its forthcoming Cybertruck.

Sadly, not long after Musk tweeted a link to the <a href="https://shop.tesla.com/product/cyberwhistle?sku=1715672-00-A"><ins>sale page</ins></a>, the whistle sold out, but there’s hope another round will be available at some point in the future.

That said, his overall review was positive, with the light weight, fun riding style and added features putting the gloss on a very good bike. Worth saying, however, is that the Indiegogo pre-order price of $2,000 is likely to skyrocket when the hardware is retail ready, so if you’re eager, dive in soon.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/urtopia-ebike-is-the-most-tech-heavy-weve-seen-140046298.html"><strong><ins>Continue Reading.</ins></strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html"><ins>Spotify&#39;s 2021 Wrapped is here to chronicle your year in music</ins></a></h2><h3>With color-coded Audio Auras and a quiz about your listening habits.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/182b3cf0-5362-11ec-beaf-a6737f149dd0" style="height:455;width:675;" alt="Image of an example Spotify Wrapped." data-uuid="bc78d6b0-4e89-3a8a-9bf8-ea69fd19dba1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Spotify</div></figure></a><p>It’s December, and that can only mean one thing: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-wrapped-2021-140005862.html"><ins>Spotify Unwrapped</ins></a> is upon us, allowing us to humblebrag (or not) about our music taste.

Now, it&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23689535011&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;linkId=7635a48c60ffd1a60ba56260b8140678&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">adding</a> two new specific Alexa sound detectors for &quot;water running&quot; and &quot;appliance beeping&quot; that can be used to set up routines or reminders. It also rolled a number of other new features for things like prescription refills, ultrasound motion detection and more.&nbsp;</p><p>It was already possible to have Alexa identify those two specific sounds, but the new update means you won&#39;t have to bother training it. With the new features, you can use the Alexa app to send a notification when the washer beeps to indicate your laundry is done. It can also remind you to turn off the sink of someone accidentally leaves the water running.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Along the same lines, the update includes the introduction of ultrasound motion detection for routines on select Echo devices. At its September event, Amazon said that a feature would arrive to fourth-gen Echo and Echo Dot devices, designed to use an &quot;inaudible ultrasound wave&quot; to detect if there are people in a room. With the new routines, you can use Alexa to turn on lights when motion is detected near the device, for instance, or lower the thermostat when no motion is detected.&nbsp;</p><p>Another new feature allows Amazon Pharmacy customers to ask Alexa to refill prescriptions and get proactive updates when they&#39;re delivered. &quot;You can also ask Alexa to call Amazon Pharmacy to connect with an Amazon Pharmacy customer care representative who can answer questions on topics like prescription status, account, billing, and also drug information and side effects,&quot; Amazon said.&nbsp;</p><p>Other new features include &quot;preference teaching&quot; that lets you teach Alexa which food or sports you like, dining suggestion (&quot;Alexa, what should I eat?&quot;), a TikTok video launcher, conversation mode (&quot;Alexa, join the conversation&quot;) and hands-free audio calls using Verizon Number share. Amazon also announced that customers can now pre-order the Echo Show 15 and have it ship on December 9th. The new features are now rolling out to Alexa devices, though some may be region-limited.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-alexa-can-tell-you-if-your-washing-machine-stops-or-water-is-running-102043428.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06f443de-7b09-4ba8-95c0-948b4c37022d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 02 Dec 2021 10:20:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638440446</ingested><modified>2021-12-02T10:20:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fbc76d50-5351-11ec-abae-0d8f7205dcb3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/fbc76d50-5351-11ec-abae-0d8f7205dcb3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon's Alexa can tell you if your washing machine stops or water is running]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon's Alexa can tell you if your washing machine stops or water is running]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's 2021 App Store Awards highlight 'connection']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-best-apps-games-2020-zoom-disney-plus-genshin-impact-disco-elysium-202554793.html">Apple focused on quarantine life </a>for its App Store Awards. For 2021, it&#39;s continuing that concept with a focus on &quot;connection&quot; as its trend of the year — basically, things that brought us together even though we&#39;re still dealing with a global pandemic. That trend award was bestowed upon five apps, including familiar names like <a href="https://bumble.com/">Bumble </a>and <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/"><em>Among Us</em></a><em>!.</em> But the niche winners are even more interesting: there&#39;s <a href="https://www.eatokra.com/">EatOkra</a>, an app that helps you find black-owned restaurants; <a href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>, which helps anyone create pro-grade designs; and <a href="https://www.peanut-app.io/">Peanut</a>, a social network focused on connecting women to find support throughout major life events.</p><p>You&#39;d probably be surprised by some of the winners for Apple&#39;s mainstay categories too: the Apple TV app of the year was the boxing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/dazn-live-sports-streaming/id1129523589">streaming service Dazn</a>, something I&#39;ve admittedly <em>never</em> heard of. The Apple TV game of the year, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/space-marshals-3/id1501495423"><em>Space Marshals 3</em></a>, also came out of seemingly nowhere. But the strong review scores for both of those apps make it clear that users genuinely enjoy them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the App Store Awards are very much a marketing exercise, it&#39;s also a useful way to highlight some of the best apps users may have missed.

According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-02/apple-tells-suppliers-iphone-demand-has-slowed-as-holidays-near"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the tech giant has told its component suppliers that demand for its biggest moneymaker has weakened just before the holiday season.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in October, the organization <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-poised-to-slash-iphone-production-goals-due-to-chip-crunch?sref=10lNAhZ9">reported</a> that Apple lowered the lineup&#39;s production goal to 80 million units — 10 million less than its original target — due to the lack of parts. However, the company was expecting to make up for the loss next year when component supplies are set to improve. Now, Apple has reportedly told its suppliers that the orders it was expecting to get next year might not materialize at all.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The global chip shortage has had significant effects on companies across industries, forcing tech companies and automakers to significantly slash their production targets. In addition to lowering the iPhone 13&#39;s production goals, Apple reportedly chose to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-cuts-ipad-production-feed-chips-iphone-13-nikkei-2021-11-02/">cut back on the iPad&#39;s</a> production to be able to allocate more chips for its new phones. But some potential buyers may already have decided to skip this generation altogether after they were faced with lengthy wait times and lack of stocks at retailers. Especially since reports suggest that the iPhone 14 will be a major upgrade and will represent a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-14-redesign-leak-152422684.html">complete redesign</a> of the company&#39;s mobile devices.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the weakening demand, analysts are still expecting Apple to reveal a sales increase of 6 percent in the final three months of 2021.

And it’s that expansion from that the rebranding is designed to encapsulate.</p><p>“We built the Square brand for our Seller business, which is where it belongs,” Dorsey said. “Block is a new name, but our purpose of economic empowerment remains the same. No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy.”</p><p>The move comes in the same week that Dorsey stepped down as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-jack-dorsey-ceo-step-down-150532889.html"><ins>CEO of Twitter</ins></a>.

Speaking to the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, Haugen once again urged Congress to act to rein in Facebook.</p><p>Unlike Haugen’s last Congressional hearing, during which she briefed senators on Facebook’s internal research, Wednesday’s hearing was meant to be focused on potential reforms of social media platforms. Specifically, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-31-s230-repeal.html"><ins>1996 law</ins></a> that shields online platforms from liability for their users&#39; actions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“This committee&#39;s attention and this Congress&#39; action are critical,” she said during her opening statement. But she also told Congress they should be careful with changing the law as it could have unintended consequences.</p><p>“As you consider reform to section 230, I encourage you to move forward with your eyes open to the consequences of reform,” Haugen said. “Congress has instituted carve outs to Section 230 in recent years. I encourage you to talk to human rights advocates who can help provide context on how the last reform of 230 had dramatic impacts on the safety of some of the most vulnerable people in our society, but has been rarely used for its original purpose.”</p><p>Pennsylvania Rep. Michael Doyle began the hearing by acknowledging the importance of Section 230, but said the courts’ interpretation of the rule should change. “To be clear, Section 230 is critically important to promoting a vibrant and free internet,” he said. “But I agree with those who suggest the courts have allowed it to stray too far.”</p><p>But throughout the hearing, there was little discussion of specific changes or potential legislation that would change 230. Many members of Congress repeated the need for bipartisan action, but there seemed to be little agreement on what actions they should take. Doyle noted in his opening statement that members of the committee have proposed four bills that would make changes to Section 230, including one that would <a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/BILLS-117hr5596ih_0.pdf"><ins>limit</ins></a> protections for companies that deployed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-bill-justice-against-malicious-algorithms-act-162915185.html"><ins>“malicious” algorithms</ins></a>.</p><p>But those four bills were barely discussed during the four-hour hearing, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html"><ins>once again</ins></a>, veered into other issues. Many Republican members on the committee opted to focus on “censorship,” and their belief that platforms like Facebook are biased against them. Haugen countered that Facebook could implement changes that would make the platform safer regardless of a user’s political beliefs.</p><p>“We spent a lot of time today talking about censorship ... what we need to do is make the platform safer through product choices,” Haugen said, describing how adding “friction” to resharing content could reduce the spread of misinformation. “We need solutions like friction to make the platform safe for everyone even if you don’t speak English.”</p><p>At one point, Jim Steyer, CEO of Common Sense Media, appeared to grow frustrated. “I would like to say to this committee, you&#39;ve talked about this for years, but you haven&#39;t done anything,” he said. “Show me a piece of legislation that you passed. 230 reform is going to be very important for protecting kids and teens on platforms like Instagram and holding them accountable and liable. But you also as a committee have to do privacy, antitrust and design reform.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/congress-quizzes-facebook-whistleblower-on-section-230-reforms-203605272.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7097ea7-2b77-4c9b-9ad9-774019ac326f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 20:36:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638390966</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T20:36:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0bf25f10-52e3-11ec-925f-bb7d0afeb7d1" width="7625" height="5083" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/0bf25f10-52e3-11ec-925f-bb7d0afeb7d1" width="7625" height="5083" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tom Williams via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UNITED STATES - DECEMBER 1: Frances Haugen, a former Facebook employee, arrives for the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Communications and Technology hearing titled Holding Big Tech Accountable: Targeted Reforms to Tech's Legal Immunity, in Rayburn Building on Wednesday, December 1, 2021.

The social network has released a new report saying that it has successfully closed down a number of networks for Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior (CIB). But in addition to networks of fake profiles all working in tandem, the company has also shed some light on how it deals with additional threats. This includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-targeted-harassment-policy-172858497.html">Brigading</a> — the use of negative comments and counter-posting to drown out an individual’s posts — and Mass Reporting, where Facebook’s own anti-harassment tools are used as a weapon. This is another step beyond the broader tactics the company announced back in September, where it pledged to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-coordinated-social-harm-180601493.html">combat broader social harms</a> that took place on its platform.</p><p>With Brigading, the company took down what it describes as a “network of accounts that originated in Italy and France” which targeted medical professionals, journalists and public officials. Facebook says that it tracked the activity back to a European anti-vaccine conspiracy movement called “V_V,” adding that its members used a large volume of fake accounts to “mass comment on posts” from individuals and news agencies “to intimidate them and suppress their views.”In addition, those accounts posted doctored images, superimposing the swastika onto the faces of prominent doctors and accusing them of supporting nazism.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In Vietnam, Facebook took down a network that was being used to target activists and users critical of the local government. The network would submit “hundreds — in some cases thousands — of complaints against their targets through our abuse reporting flows.” Attackers also created duplicate accounts of the users they intended to silence and then reported the real account as an impersonator from the fake account. Facebook added that some of these fake accounts were automatically detected and disabled by the company’s automatic moderation tools.</p><p>As for the more old-fashioned methods of Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior, the company took down networks in Palestine, Poland, Belarus and China. The first was reportedly tied to Hamas, while the second two were crafted to exacerbate tensions during the humanitarian crisis on the border there. In a call with reporters, Facebook said that the Polish network had very good operational security and, so far, it has not been able to tie it to a real-world organization. The Belarusian network, on the other hand, had much poorer operational security, and so the company has tied the activity to the Belarusian KGB.</p><p>The final network, out of China, has prompted Facebook to publish a deep dive into the activity given the depth of what took place. In its report, the company says that a group created a fake profile of a Swiss biologist called Wilson Edwards who posted material critical of the US and WHO. 48 hours later, and his comments were picked up by Chinese state media, and engaged with by high-level officials. But there was no evidence that Wilson Edwards existed, which prompted the platform to close the account.</p><p>Researchers found that Edwards’ was “the work of a multi-pronged, largely unsuccessful influence operation,” involving “employees of Chinese state infrastructure companies across four continents.” Facebook wanted to make it clear that Edwards’ comments were not engaged with organically, and it was only when the posts were reported by state media did things suddenly rise in prominence.</p><p>One thing that Facebook did identify is the use of guides which were used to train potential network members. The V_V network, for instance, published videos through its Telegram channels that suggested that users replace letters in key words so that it wouldn’t be picked up by automatic filtering.

A lot has changed in four years, if not as much as you might think — this is as much about dragging the device into the modern era as anything.</p><p>The Nook GlowLight 4 is billed as &quot;sleeker&quot; than the GlowLight 3, with a smaller overall profile, better page-turning buttons and a more comfortable hand feel. It&#39;s the first Nook e-reader with USB-C, and storage has quadrupled to 32GB. However, you&#39;ll still see a 6-inch, 300DPI e-paper display and a claimed one-month battery life. This is more for Nook newcomers, or those upgrading from particularly old devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The GlowLight 4 ships December 8th for $150.

It&#39;s a viable alternative if you don&#39;t want to attach yourself to the Amazon or Kobo ecosystems, though. Also, this is as much a declaration of intent as a new product. Barnes &amp; Noble chief James Daunt said the company planned to &quot;reinvigorate&quot; the Nook line in the months and years ahead — this may just be one of the opening salvos.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/barnes-and-noble-nook-glowlight-4-e-reader-191526217.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7b3b9ac6-9be3-496d-ae1a-03674e4d0b2f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 19:15:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638387174</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T19:33:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d0141e10-52cf-11ec-bfe9-1978834475e4" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/d0141e10-52cf-11ec-bfe9-1978834475e4" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barnes & Noble]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Barnes & Noble Nook GlowLight 4 e-reader]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Barnes & Noble Nook GlowLight 4 e-reader]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[CVS Pharmacy now offers audio prescription labels across the US]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following a trial in 2020 involving 1,700 locations across the US, CVS is <a href="https://cvshealth.com/news-and-insights/press-releases/spoken-rx-talking-prescription-labels-now-available-in-all-cvs"><ins>expanding the availability of its Spoken Rx</ins></a> audio prescription labels to all 10,000 of its pharmacies nationwide.

And we say it doesn&#39;t work, we mean it&#39;s almost entirely broken. Most people report they can&#39;t run any of the software they&#39;ve downloaded from Amazon.

The drone has a top speed of just under 56mph.</p><p>The Airpeak Flight app for iOS provides real-time status info and updates on the hardware. With the Airpeak Base web app, users can create advanced, repeatable flight plans, manage the drone and camera and troubleshoot issues. There&#39;s also a dual operation mode, which allows one person to control the drone and another to operate the camera and gimbal. Both users can see what the camera is capturing.</p><p>The Airpeak S1 comes with two sets of propellers, two rechargeable batteries and a controller. Sony has shaved $1,000 off the previously announced price — the drone now costs a still-eye-watering <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/more/airpeak/p/arss1"><ins>$9,000</ins></a>. The S1 should ship on December 24th, so it might arrive a little too late to be an extremely generous holiday gift.</p><p>There&#39;s an optional cloud service called Airpeak Plus that offers extra storage, enhanced geofencing tools and flight log importing and exporting. It costs around $300 for 12 months.</p><div id="b76079c1546b487586a4c962208097f1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jnyUPbM9H7Q?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-airpeak-s1-drone-alpha-cameras-pre-order-171505573.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5efdb7c-0cc0-4ada-aff7-6b118451e341</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:15:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638377961</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T16:59:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/70ac55a0-52c5-11ec-99a7-2565d27a543c" width="1108" height="624" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/70ac55a0-52c5-11ec-99a7-2565d27a543c" width="1108" height="624" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony's Sony Airpeak S1 drone with an attached camera and gimbal sitting on a rocky surface.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony Airpeak S1 drone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Digital car keys arrive on Pixel 6 and Samsung Galaxy S21]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google/"><ins>Google</ins></a> has revealed a slew of features and updates for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-review-material-you-privacy-controls-180010087.html"><ins>Android 12</ins></a>. Starting today, the digital car key function that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-digital-car-key-183057490.html"><ins>announced at Google I/O</ins></a> in May is available on Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S21 for compatible BMW vehicles in select countries. You can use your phone to lock and unlock the doors, and start the engine. The feature is likely coming to other vehicles later — Google has been working with other, unnamed automakers on support for digital car keys.</p><p>There&#39;s now an option to open <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%20auto/"><ins>Android Auto</ins></a> automatically when you connect your device to a compatible car. In addition, the home screen will have an always-on play button, so you can fire up your favorite music with a single tap.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Smart reply options (which will arrive in the coming months) will offer more ways to respond to text messages while you&#39;re driving. You can tap to reply or create a custom message with the help of Google Assistant. Also coming soon, there&#39;ll be a faster way to search for music in your media apps. Just tap the search button and say the name of your favorite artist or song.</p><p>Other media-centric options are coming to the home screen of Android 12 proper. A <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube%20music/"><ins>YouTube Music</ins></a> widget, for instance, includes playback controls and recently played songs. Two other widgets are rolling out next week. One for Google Play Books offers access to your library of books and could help you keep track of where you are in audiobooks.</p><div id="315b3824a81e436d8fd10bf02faccb34"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hp-lGxwPUnI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>A Google Photos People &amp; Pets widget, meanwhile, provides an easy way to bring your loved ones to the home screen. Select a few faces and a frame, and your family, friends and pets can take pride of place on the home screen.</p><p>Elsewhere in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google%20photos/"><ins>Google Photos</ins></a>, you&#39;ll start to see Memories in the photo grid. It&#39;s a curated selection of photos and videos from holidays and events like birthdays and graduations, which are displayed in a stories format. Along with renaming, personalizing and correcting them, you&#39;ll have the option to remove Memories from the grid.</p><div id="897573efa662474f80216840f63abc78"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6CiQEfiZv9s?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Google is bringing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-family-bell-smart-speaker-display-150006076.html"><ins>Family Bell</ins></a> from smart home products to mobile devices. You can set up the feature to alert you and your family with bells and notifications when it&#39;s time to do certain things, such as picking up kids from school or getting to bed at a decent hour. Family members can set or customize as many bells as they like on their own devices to keep stay on schedule. Google will offer suggested bells too, including holiday-themed ones like volunteering for a local cause or watering the tree.</p><p>In Gboard&#39;s Emoji Kitchen, you&#39;ll see thousands more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-gboard-android-emoji-kitchen.html"><ins>emoji mashups</ins></a>. They&#39;ll be available for Gboard Beta users starting today and for everyone in the coming weeks.</p><p>Last, but not least, Google announced another Android security measure. To help protect your privacy, your device will automatically turn off runtime permissions (which allow apps to access data or carry out actions for you) in apps you haven&#39;t used in a while. You can turn these permissions back on in the app or the device settings. The feature will be available on Android 12 at first. Starting next month, Google plans to roll it out to devices with Google Play services running Android 6.0 or later.</p><div id="f25b59b5996c40c6826921bec94efca9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKqSayojRkg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-digital-car-keys-assistant-widgets-photos-youtube-music-170006763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e177addb-cd0c-43c7-8d13-cabf4842388f</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638373708</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T15:48:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/906d0ab0-52bb-11ec-afe4-fca6a6a20720" width="1037" height="659" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/906d0ab0-52bb-11ec-afe4-fca6a6a20720" width="1037" height="659" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An illustration showing a selection of new Android 12 features.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Verizon and Bang & Olufsen made soundbars with Android TV built-in]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Verizon (Engadget&#39;s former parent company) isn&#39;t just relying on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-verizon-stream-tv.html">no-frills media players</a> to push its Stream TV platform. The carrier has <a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/verizon-bang-and-olufsen-soundbars-stream-tv">unveiled</a> the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Stream TV Soundbar" href="https://fave.co/32Kcp5b">Stream TV Soundbar</a> (shown below) and Stream TV Soundbar Pro (at top), both of which mate Android TV with Bang &amp; Olufsen&#39;s audio know-how and some high-end features to match. All of them include Dolby Atmos surround sound and content-sensitive sound field selection — it&#39;s just a question of how much B&amp;O influence you want.</p><p>The base Stream TV Soundbar costs $400 with five speakers &quot;tuned&quot; by B&amp;O as well as two HDMI ports. Step up to the $1,000 Soundbar Pro and you&#39;ll get nine B&amp;O speakers, a third HDMI port and a B&amp;O-designed profile. Both run the same Stream TV interface with similar software features (including Chromecast streaming and the Google Play Store), so it really comes down to your budget and desire for Danish audio.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both soundbars are available solely through Verizon as of today (December 1st). They face stiff competition. On top of direct rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-24-jbl-link-bar-android-tv-soundbar-finally-on-sale.html">JBL&#39;s Link Bar</a>, you can find plenty of not-quite-so-connected soundbars like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html">Sonos Arc</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-gen-2-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-130024506.html">Beam</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a5000-soundbar-announced-specs-price-availability-140034265.html">Sony&#39;s HT-A5000</a>. Verizon&#39;s bars make the most sense if you&#39;re already shopping the company&#39;s store, unimpressed with your immediately available alternatives or just want a (relatively) inexpensive way to get B&amp;O sound into your living room.</p><div id="1b6db76cacc64bb6b7d58ad834180264"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Q77kORvl9g?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/verizon-bang-and-olufsen-soundbars-android-tv-161520556.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4820a0d8-9476-40ac-ad5f-41d52e618b14</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 01 Dec 2021 16:15:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1638378177</ingested><modified>2021-12-01T17:03:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b54bfa0-52ba-11ec-96df-16c1d1f47e63" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b54bfa0-52ba-11ec-96df-16c1d1f47e63" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Verizon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Verizon Stream TV Soundbar Pro (top) and Soundbar (bottom)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Verizon Stream TV Soundbar Pro (top) and Soundbar (bottom)]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
