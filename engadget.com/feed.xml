Here&#39;s your chance to get some at a good price.

The best values are among the most recent buds, however — the Elite 75t is at an all-time low <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:for $100" href="https://amzn.to/3FSBs5h">of $100</a> ($50 off), while the newer Elite 85t is on sale <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:for $180" href="https://amzn.to/3APkOjc">for $180</a> (also $50 off).

These may be your picks for lengthy studying sessions and arduous hikes. The 75t is a relatively no-frills design, while the 85t adds perks like active noise cancellation and optional wireless charging.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>They have their catches. The Elite 75t is relatively plain at a time when many $100 earbuds <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-buds-2nd-gen-review-130018884.html">offer ANC</a>, and their on-bud controls take practice. The Elite 85t is feature-packed, but it sounds merely average for the money. Don&#39;t overlook the importance of comfort, though — and Jabra&#39;s platform independence might be a plus if you aren&#39;t tied to any one device ecosystem.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-75t-85t-sale-amazon-155042486.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">78fe52ea-fb3f-466b-b86f-04a5eb6c69ec</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 15:50:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634485842</ingested><modified>2021-10-17T15:50:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2b9f590-2f5b-11ec-bfeb-90b074686c1a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2b9f590-2f5b-11ec-bfeb-90b074686c1a" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85t wireless earbuds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 85t wireless earbuds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's new MacBook Pro chips may be called the M1 Pro and M1 Max]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Leaks are still pouring in just a day before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-what-to-expect-october-18-unleashed-142518973.html">Apple&#39;s &quot;Unleashed&quot; event</a> kicks off. <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/17/m1-pro-and-m1-max-chip-names-app-log/">According</a> to <em>MacRumors</em>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">Mark Gurman</a> understands the chips for the widely expected 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models have surfaced in developer app logs under the names &quot;M1 Pro&quot; and &quot;M1 Max.&quot; It&#39;s not certain Apple will use these names for its high-end silicon, but they suggest Apple won&#39;t go with M1X or otherwise echo the naming scheme used for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-26-apple-ipad-pro-12-9-review-2020-lidar-trackpad.html">souped-up A-series chips</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier rumors have hinted at two processors destined for the new MacBook Pros. Both would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-cpu-leaks-151945192.html">include 10 cores</a> (eight high-performance, two high-efficiency). An &#39;entry&#39; version would include a 16-core GPU, while the higher-end model would pack a 32-core GPU. This roughly lines up with the M1 Pro and M1 Max naming schemes. Other rumors have pointed to a direct sequel to the base M1, the M2, arriving sometime in early 2022 alongside a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Gurman also reiterated the changes he and others expect from the MacBook Pro redesign. Both laptops would include mini-LED displays with higher resolutions. They may bring back welcome connectors like a MagSafe power port, HDMI and an SD card slot. You might also see support for up to 64GB of RAM and the death of the Touch Bar.</p><p>It wouldn&#39;t be shocking if Apple brought its Pro and Max naming schemes to computer CPUs. If Apple is going to replace all Intel chips with in-house processors, as planned, those clearer names might be necessary to help buyers understand performance differences between models. If Apple does use the M1 Pro and M1 Max names, that will speak volumes about its likely chip name strategy going forward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-pro-m1-pro-m1-max-leak-145253589.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">04cb5fc6-f453-4aec-ba15-757c0dff80e7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 17 Oct 2021 14:52:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634482374</ingested><modified>2021-10-17T14:53:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c3f773a0-b7e5-11eb-bfff-8865a6ff63da" width="1600" height="1033" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/c3f773a0-b7e5-11eb-bfff-8865a6ff63da" width="1600" height="1033" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Russian crew returns from shooting the first feature film on the ISS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Shooting for the first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/international-space-station-russia-movie-the-challenge-183808670.html">feature-length movie in space</a> has wrapped. <em>Space.com</em><a href="https://www.space.com/soyuz-ms-18-landing-challenge">reports</a> Russian actress Yulia Pereslid, producer Klim Shipenko and cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy have <a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2021/10/17/russian-station-veteran-filmmakers-back-on-earth/">returned</a> to Earth after the first two spent 12 days filming their movie <em>The Challenge</em> aboard the International Space Station.

Novitskiy had been there since April 9th as part of his regular duties, although he also played a key role — the movie has Pereslid play a surgeon who makes an emergency visit to the ISS to operate on the cosmonaut.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The filming required significant sacrifices for some of the ISS crew. NASA astronaut Mark Vande Hei and Russian cosmonaut Pyotr Dubrov were originally slated to return aboard the Soyuz capsule, but both have had their stays extended by six months to accommodate the film producers. Vande Hei will set a record for the longest spaceflight by a US astronaut as a result, spending exactly one year in orbit. Pereslid also broke ground as the first professional actor to visit space, beating <a href="https://www.engadget.com/william-shatner-blue-origin-spaceflight-successful-145444763.html">William Shatner</a> by roughly a week.</p><p>It will be a while before <em>The Challenge</em> is ready to watch, and it&#39;s safe to say the production is aimed primarily at a Russian audience.

They&#39;ve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9vFB65-U_c">released</a> a story trailer for <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> that shows the formation of Task Force X and explains why your band of supervillains (Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, Deadshot and King Shark) has to destroy some of Earth&#39;s greatest heroes.</p><p>As it turns out, Brainiac has possessed the Justice League and is using heroes to wreak havoc. The Task Force is the first unit to make it into Metropolis alive, as X organizer Amanda Waller explains. It&#39;s also clear that Harley and crew aren&#39;t exactly eager volunteers, as their heads are &quot;ticking.&quot; Superman, Green Lantern and The Flash also get some attention in the trailer, and even The Penguin makes an unusual cameo appearance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s unfortunately no gameplay in this trailer, and the developers haven&#39;t committed to a more specific release date than &quot;2022&quot; for the PC, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-x-review-microsoft-140045437.html">Xbox Series X</a>/<a href="https://www.engadget.com/xbox-series-s-review-140027758.html">S</a> versions. Even so, this gives you a better idea of what to expect: plenty of witty banter, a world turned on its head and an almost casual approach to violence. The main question is simply whether Rocksteady can build on the reputation from its <em>Batman</em> games and deliver action on par with this teaser footage.</p><div id="4683a141983243a0b30b7abb8f1aebef"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J9vFB65-U_c?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/suicide-game-story-trailer-rocksteady-210739084.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20ccb67c-3895-46a4-bdf7-90dc40096259</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 21:07:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634420302</ingested><modified>2021-10-16T21:38:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/12518160-2ec1-11ec-beff-2b4f74663e78" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/12518160-2ec1-11ec-beff-2b4f74663e78" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Rocksteady/Warner Bros.

So does FIFA, apparently.  <em>Eurogamer</em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-10-15-fifa-says-football-gaming-must-involve-more-than-one-party-controlling-and-exploiting-all-rights">notes</a> that FIFA has issued a <a href="https://www.fifa.com/news/fifa-set-to-widen-gaming-and-esports-portfolio">statement</a> insisting that soccer gaming and eSports should have more than one party &quot;controlling and exploiting all rights&quot; — a not-so-subtle reference to EA. Accordingly, FIFA is talking to developers, investors and other groups to &quot;widen&quot; its gaming and eSports options.</p><p>The organization added this would help &quot;maximize all future opportunities.&quot; It also reiterated its commitment to running eSports tournaments under its FIFAe brand.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The statement comes at a crucial moment for both EA and FIFA. EA&#39;s current licensing deal expires after the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, and <em>New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/sports/soccer/ea-sports-fifa.html">sources</a> claim talks have stalled between the two sides. FIFA reportedly wants more than double its current cut from EA (more than $1 billion over four years) while also limiting EA&#39;s rights to keep it to video games. EA, meanwhile, is <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Electronic-Arts-Announces-Record-breaking-FIFA-22-Launch-and-Provides-Comments-on-the-Future-of-Football/default.aspx">considering new names</a> for its soccer games while supposedly exploring new concepts like arena-based tournaments, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nft-explainer-digital-art-collectibles-blockchain-environment-business-investment-cryptocurrency-153023551.html">NFTs</a> and even highlights for real-world games.</p><p>A decision is expected by the end of 2021, according to <em>The Times</em>, but EA is hedging its bets by registering an &quot;EA Sports FC&quot; trademark. EA and FIFA have declined to comment on the talks.</p><p>In that context, FIFA&#39;s statement may serve as a warning shot — see things our way or miss out on a valuable licensing agreement. While EA&#39;s existing clout might help a non-licensed game sell, there&#39;s little doubt a generic game would lose players hoping to control Mbappé or Messi in real clubs. EA won&#39;t necessarily bow to FIFA as a result. It might, however, be more aware of what&#39;s at stake if deal negotiations fall apart.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fifa-criticizes-ea-dominance-of-soccer-games-191851861.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">873abb32-990f-4df0-99d0-bffacdc2c70f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 19:18:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634411935</ingested><modified>2021-10-16T19:18:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Soccer]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5c72e910-2eac-11ec-9fdf-d0327a5a31d7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5c72e910-2eac-11ec-9fdf-d0327a5a31d7" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA Sports]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kylian Mbappe charges forward in 'FIFA 22']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Kylian Mbappe charges forward in 'FIFA 22']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The future of ‘Minecraft’ includes swamps, scary monsters and a Game Pass bundle]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday, Mojang held its annual Minecraft Live fan convention. As in years past, the event saw the studio detail the future of its immensely popular sandbox game. And if you&#39;re a fan of <em>Minecraft</em>, the livestream did not disappoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The studio kicked off the event with the announcement of The Wild Update. Set to come out sometime in 2022, Mojang promises this latest DLC will change how players explore and interact with the game’s overworld. The update will introduce an entirely new swamp biome that includes mangroves players can pick fruit from and replant to nurture new plants.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Deep Dark, which was previously planned for 2021, will now launch instead in 2022 alongside The Wild Update. First announced at Minecraft Live 2020, the DLC adds the Warden, a new enemy character that is one of the game’s scariest yet. Players who brave the DLC will find special new items only available in the deep dark.</p><p>In the meantime, fans can look forward to part two of the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/updates/caves-and-cliffs">Caves and Cliffs update</a> coming out later this year. In the first half of 2021, Mojang made the decision to split the update into two parts due to the complexity of the included features. At Minecraft Live, the studio said that was the right decision, in part because it allowed the team to take into consideration community feedback. As previously announced, the update will include expanded caves and biomes. It will also increase the height and depth limit of worlds.</p><p>Mojang hasn’t forgotten about <a href="https://www.engadget.com/minecraft-dungeons-preview-interview-130029404.html"><em>Minecraft Dungeons</em></a>. In December, the studio will introduce a new feature called Seasonal Adventures. Each week, you and your friends will have to chance to take on weekly challenges. As you complete them, you’ll earn progress towards a seasonal progression track that unlocks rewards like new skins, pets and emotes. Season One, The Cloudy Climb, will add a new Tower feature and adventure hub for players to explore.</p><p>Now is also the perfect time to either try <em>Minecraft</em> for the first time or return to the game after an extended break. On November 2nd, Microsoft will release a <em>Minecraft</em> bundle for Xbox Game Pass on PC. The pack includes both the Bedrock and Java editions of the game, with support for a single MSA log-in across both.</p><p>The updates come at a time when <em>Minecraft</em> has never been more popular. Just this past August, Mojang said more than 140 million players logged in to play the game, representing a new milestone for the title. Minecraft Live then was about positioning the game for a future where it continues to grow.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mojang-minecraft-live-2021-updates-173255619.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42627285-79e7-49be-9504-178aabbad7bb</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 17:32:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634405579</ingested><modified>2021-10-16T17:33:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ddcb2660-2e81-11ec-bffd-d8075a925d79" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ddcb2660-2e81-11ec-bffd-d8075a925d79" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mojang Studios / Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Minecraft Dungeons]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Minecraft Dungeons]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[There's now an official 'Minecraft' gaming chair]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-gaming-chair-built-in-katana-demon-slayer-142546594.html">Themed gaming chairs</a> aren&#39;t completely new, but this example is rather unusual. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/minecraft-secretlab-chair-collaboration-announcement">According</a> to <em>Windows Central,</em> Microsoft and Mojang have collaborated with Secretlab on a <em>Minecraft</em> chair. The Minecraft Edition Titan Evo 2022 includes the obligatory game logos, but it&#39;s also made to look like you&#39;re sitting on one of the game&#39;s infamous Creepers. That sounds more than a little... creepy, but it might be just what you&#39;re looking for if you livestream <em>Minecraft</em> or otherwise want to advertise your fondness for the classic creative title.</p><p>And unlike the in-game Creepers, this chair shouldn&#39;t explode. This is Secretlab&#39;s first special-run chair to use the company&#39;s SoftWeave Plus fabric, which promises to blend durability with comfort. You might not have to worry quite so much about spills or tears ruining your gaming throne.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can pre-order the <em>Minecraft</em> gaming chair today starting at $549 for small and regular versions, and $599 for XL. That&#39;s a lot to spend on any chair, especially a special edition — you might want to be sure your love of the game is more than just a short-term fling. If it is, though, the expense might be worthwhile to improve your comfort (and hopefully posture) for those lengthy world-building sessions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/minecraft-gaming-chair-secretlab-173058454.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">63e85b9b-ca35-405c-8740-a8555e19cf89</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 17:30:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634405461</ingested><modified>2021-10-16T17:31:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/74829510-2ea1-11ec-bf7f-11925ec14f0e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/74829510-2ea1-11ec-bf7f-11925ec14f0e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Secret Lab]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Minecraft' gaming chair from Secret Lab]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Minecraft' gaming chair from Secret Lab]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[McDonald's will trial its plant-based burger in the US on November 3rd]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You may soon be able to give McDonald&#39;s plant-based burgers a try.

It&#39;s a limited-time trial run for the burger, and it&#39;s supposed to help the company figure out how having the item in its menu will impact its kitchen operations.&nbsp;</p><p>The burger&#39;s patty is made with Beyond Meat plant-based meat.

Back when the McPlant was first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mcdonalds-plant-based-burger-meatless-mcplant-171734231.html">announced</a>, the fast-food giant said it &quot;delivers [its] iconic taste in a sink-your-teeth-in (and wipe-your-mouth) kind of sandwich.

McDonald&#39;s is also trialing the burger in other countries, including Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria and the UK. While the McPlant is simply a burger for now, McDonald&#39;s previously said that it could represent a whole line of plant-based menu items in the future, including chicken substitutes and breakfast sandwiches.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mc-donalds-trial-run-us-mcplant-164512755.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e2c4fbef-7b7d-4255-9ac9-308099b847c6</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 16:45:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634402125</ingested><modified>2021-10-16T16:35:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/804de120-2e7d-11ec-bff5-ffaa0a3e667f" width="1440" height="810" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/804de120-2e7d-11ec-bff5-ffaa0a3e667f" width="1440" height="810" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[McDonald's]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[McDonald's]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[McDonald's]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Analogue Pocket's OS is meant as the 'definitive' platform for retro games]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-delay-december-220026363.html">Analogue&#39;s Pocket handheld</a> won&#39;t arrive until late this year, but the company is betting that its software will be worth the wait. <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/16/analogue-aspires-to-build-the-definitive-os-for-retro-gaming/">notes</a> the company has <a href="https://twitter.com/analogue/status/1449389698493861888">detailed</a> AnalogueOS, the platform the Pocket and future Analogue devices will run — and it&#39;s pitched as nothing less than the &quot;definitive&quot; OS for retro games, a way to showcase classics that haven&#39;t always received the kindest treatment.</p><p>Rather than simply play cartridge games, the Pocket and future hardware will tap into a library that provides all the useful data surrounding a game, ranging from box art and publisher data to guides.

Cherlynn Low strapped on the Apple Watch Series 7 to see how it compares to the previous version and to find out how much of a difference the larger screen makes. Igor Bonifacic tested the 2021 Motorola Edge smartphone and found it offers a lot of high-end features — including a 144Hz display — at a budget-friendly price. Terrence O’Brien played with the effects and inputs on the Roland SP-404MKII and reported that it makes chopping samples more fun. Finally, Jess Conditt sat in the virtual driver’s seat to play <em>Forza Horizon 5, </em>a game she declares a perfect getaway in a time of travel restrictions.</p><h2>The Apple Watch Series 7 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">bigger and better</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bb9e4c00-2dca-11ec-9f7f-d2efc77f9e58" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" data-uuid="2e5050a7-76d2-38bf-b3f9-a6f9c7b951c0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low acknowledges that the main difference between the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Watch Series 7" href="https://amzn.to/3j85k3E">Apple Watch Series 7</a> and the previous model is the larger screen, but she’s adamant that even this small change makes a big impact. The Series 7’s display is 20 percent larger than that of the Series 6, and has significantly smaller bezels. It’s also the first Apple Watch to be IP6X certified for dust resistance, making it more durable. Cherlynn said the larger display made things easier to read and navigate, and the extra screen space made it easier to enter in the right keys and see more of messages.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple also debuted some additional watch faces and a full QWERTY keyboard on the Series 7. Cherlynn says the new faces are designed to display more information at once. The full QWERTY keyboard provided more flexibility, but since she only got roughly a 60-percent accuracy rate when tapping on the display, Cherlynn said she still preferred using dictation. Apple still doesn’t offer advanced sleep tracking, though this model will log your respiration rate while you sleep and report back the next morning. If sleep tracking isn’t your main reason for wanting a smartwatch, Cherlynn says the Series 7 will be a satisfying purchase.</p><h2>The 2021 Motorola Edge is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/motorola-edge-2021-review-130059627.html">easier to recommend than its predecessor</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/959a4850-2dcb-11ec-9eff-e978667c1082" alt="Moto Edge 2021" data-uuid="a5cc7a3f-48c4-3bf5-a441-39142e12c1ad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Igor Bonifacic / Engadget</div></figure><p>Of the various upgrades to the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:2021 Motorola Edge" href="https://fave.co/3DyeyhE">2021 Motorola Edge</a>, Igor Bonifacic thinks the 6.8-inch LCD 144Hz screen is the stand-out feature. The flat edges made it easier to hold and the improved refresh rate makes the Edge feel smooth and responsive. The screen is vibrant, bright and has support for HDR10, plus Igor says the 19.5:9 aspect ratio works well for scrolling through vertical apps. He also liked the move to a capacitive fingerprint scanner on the side-mounted power button because it made unlocking the phone while wearing a mask significantly easier.</p><p>However, there are some tradeoffs for the $550 smartphone, notably the LCD screen, which lacks the power efficiency and deep blacks that OLED can offer. The 144Hz display also produced some slight glitching. In addition, the device’s single speaker produced tinny sound, and he found the ultra-wide camera mediocre. But he did like the battery life, which lasted a whopping two days, and the extended 2-year software support. If you don’t mind a few compromises, Igor says the 2021 Edge is well worth checking out.</p><h2>Roland’s SP-404MKII sampler is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-sp-404-mkii-hands-on-dragging-an-iconic-sampler-into-the-modern-age-070043439.html">pleasure to use</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1c715350-2dcc-11ec-86e6-c18d0a65cb8b" alt="Roland SP-404MKII" data-uuid="544b00a3-ace0-3d2b-926a-7ea0f362a118"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Though the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:SP-404MKII" href="https://bit.ly/3j5ytg4">SP-404MKII</a> sampler physically resembles previous versions, Terrence O’Brien says the new OLED screen and 16-pad layout are huge upgrades. The new display can show the actual waveform as it’s being edited, which makes recording and editing samples easier and more fun. And the 16-pad set up is not only more standard, but it also offers users more samples and patterns to make beats. Terrence also preferred the refreshed color scheme of grey and black with muted orange and white accents.</p><p>The SP-404MKII has a few more minor upgrades: it’s the first sampler in the line to feature velocity sensitive pads and it has MIDI out as well as MIDI IN connectors. This means the 404 can get hooked up to a PC via USB-C, or be used with external gear. Terrence played around with both the input effects, courtesy of the ¼-inch audio input and headphone jacks, as well as the bus effects and found that chopping samples on the machine is actually enjoyable instead of a chore. The SP-404MKII is also fairly portable: Terrence says it can fit in a bag easily enough and it can be powered with six AA batteries. And it&#39;s affordable at $500, which makes it a reasonable purchase even for those who are just looking to dabble in sampling.</p><h2><em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>is an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-preview-xbox-series-s-bronco-130028198.html">enjoyable escape</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9f28c3f0-2dcc-11ec-bfdf-ed8a8ff3fc8f" alt="Forza Horizon 5" data-uuid="4499e853-ebee-3467-a298-443acb636d06"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playground Games</div></figure><p>Since she couldn’t get behind the wheel of a real-life 2021 Ford Bronco, Jess Conditt did the next best thing: she drove it around the race tracks and lush environments of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Forza Horizon 5" href="https://amzn.to/3vnx6OD"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a><em>. </em>Though she only had access to a preview build, she reports back that <em>Horizon 5</em> is a mellower version of the motorsport game, spread across a fictionalized Mexico and featuring tricked out vehicles including a 2020 Corvette Stingray Coupe and a 1989 Porsche 911 Desert Flyer.</p><p>Regardless of which vehicle you choose, Jess says they’re all magical to (virtually) drive. They get window cracks and door dents but are largely indestructible and always land tires-down. She also appreciated the layers of customization within the game, from accessories to creating characters to upgrading vehicles with designs. On the Xbox Series S, the game ran smoothly and looked lovely at 1080p/60fps. Jess says even without ray-tracing, <em>Horizon 5’s </em>distinct biomes, weather and environments were all a treat to view, making it a perfect virtual escape.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-the-apple-watch-series-7-makes-the-most-of-its-bigger-screen-160058245.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9d8dd28-2021-4c8a-bce1-e9f214fe6ef1</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 16:00:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634319338</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T17:35:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9761caa0-2b96-11ec-bffd-fddd7431d5dc" width="1900" height="1267" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9761caa0-2b96-11ec-bffd-fddd7431d5dc" width="1900" height="1267" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An off-angle view of the Apple Watch Series 7 on a person's wrist, showing the screen's refracted edge and the watch's dial and button.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hitting the Books: How Amazon's aggressive R&D push made it an e-commerce behemoth]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is the Standard Oil of the 21st century.

With retail revenues in excess of $213 billion, it was larger than Germany’s Schwarz Gruppe, America’s Costco, and every British retailer. Only America’s Walmart, with more than half a trillion dollars of sales, was bigger. But Amazon was, by this time, far and away the world’s largest online retailer. Its online business was about eight times larger than Walmart’s. Amazon was more than just an online shop, however. Its huge operations in areas such as cloud computing, logistics, media, and hardware added a further $172 billion in sales.</p><p>At the heart of Amazon’s success is an annual research and development budget that reached a staggering $36 billion in 2019, and which is used to develop everything from robots to smart home assistants. This sum leaves other companies — and many governments — behind. It is not far off the UK government’s annual budget for research and development. The entire US government’s federal R&amp;D budget for 2018 was only $134 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon spent more on R&amp;D in 2018 than the US National Institutes of Health. Roche, the global pharmaceutical company renowned for its investment in research, spent a mere $12 billion in R&amp;D in 2018. Meanwhile Tesco, the largest retailer in Britain — with annual sales in excess of £50 billion (approximately $70 billion) — had a research lab whose budget was in the “six figures” in 2016.</p><p>Perhaps more remarkable is the rate at which Amazon grew this budget. Ten years earlier, Amazon’s research budget was $1.2 billion. Over the course of the next decade, the firm increased its annual R&amp;D budget by about 44 percent every year. As the 2010s went on, Amazon doubled down on its investments in research. In the words of Werner Vogels, the firm’s chief technology officer, if they stopped innovating they “would be out of business in ten to fifteen years.”</p><p>In the process, Amazon created a chasm between the old world and the new. The approach of traditional business was to rely on models that succeeded yesterday. They were based on a strategy that tomorrow might be a little different, but not markedly so.</p><p>This kind of linear thinking, rooted in the assumption that change takes decades and not months, may have worked in the past—but not anymore. Amazon understood the nature of the Exponential Age. The pace of change was accelerating; the companies that could harness the technologies of the new era would take off. And those that couldn’t keep up would be undone at remarkable speed.</p><p>This divergence between the old and the new is one example of what I call the “exponential gap.” On the one hand, there are technologies that develop at an exponential pace—and the companies, institutions, and communities that adapt to or harness those developments. On the other, there are the ideas and norms of the old world. The companies, institutions, and communities that can only adapt at an incremental pace. These get left behind—and fast.</p><p>The emergence of this gap is a consequence of exponential technology. Until the early 2010s, most companies assumed the cost of their inputs would remain pretty similar from year to year, perhaps with a nudge for inflation. The raw materials might fluctuate based on commodity markets, but their planning processes, institutionalized in management orthodoxy, could manage such volatility. But in the Exponential Age, one primary input for a company is its ability to process information. One of the main costs to process that data is computation. And the cost of computation didn’t rise each year; it declined rapidly. The underlying dynamics of how companies operate had shifted.</p><p>In Chapter 1, we explored how Moore’s Law amounts to a halving of the underlying cost of computation every couple of years. It means that every ten years, the cost of the processing that can be done by a computer will decline by a factor of one hundred. But the implications of this process stretch far beyond our personal laptop use—and far beyond the interests of any one laptop manufacturer.</p><p>In general, if an organization needs to do something that uses computation, and that task is too expensive today, it probably won’t be too expensive in a couple of years. For companies, this realization has deep significance. Firms that figured out that the effective price of computation was declining, even if the notional price of what they were buying was staying the same (or even rising), could plan, practice, and experiment with the near future in mind. Even if those futuristic activities were expensive now, they would become affordable soon enough. Organizations that understood this deflation, and planned for it, became well-positioned to take advantage of the Exponential Age.</p><p>If Amazon’s early recognition of this trend helped transform it into one of the most valuable companies in history, they were not alone. Many of the new digital giants—from Uber to Alibaba, Spotify to TikTok—took a similar path. And following in their footsteps were firms who understand how these processes apply in other sectors. The bosses at Tesla understood that the prices of electric vehicles might decline on an exponential curve, and launched the electric vehicle revolution. The founders of Impossible Foods understood how the expensive process of precision fermentation (which involves genetically modified microorganisms) would get cheaper and cheaper. Executives at space companies like Spire and Planet Labs understood this process would drive down the cost of putting satellites in orbit. Companies that didn’t adapt to exponential technology shifts, like much of the newspaper publishing industry, didn’t stand a chance.</p><p>We can visualize the gap by returning to our now-familiar exponential curve. As we’ve seen, individual technologies develop according to an S-curve, which begins by roughly following an exponential trajectory. And as we’ve seen, it starts off looking a bit humdrum. In those early days, exponential change is distinctly boring, and most people and organizations ignore it. At this point in the curve, the industry producing an exponential technology looks exciting to those in it, but like a backwater to everyone else. But at some point, the line of exponential change crosses that of linear change. Soon it reaches an inflection point. That shift in gear, which is both sudden and subtle, is hard to fathom.&nbsp;</p><p>Because, for all the visibility of exponential change, most of the institutions that make up our society follow a linear trajectory. Codified laws and unspoken social norms; legacy companies and NGOs; political systems and intergovernmental bodies—all have only ever known how to adapt incrementally. Stability is an important force within institutions. In fact, it’s built into them.</p><p>The gap between our institutions’ capacity to change and our new technologies’ accelerating speed is the defining consequence of our shift into the Exponential Age. On the one side, you have the new behaviors, relationships, and structures that are enabled by exponentially improving technologies, and the products and services built from them. On the other, you have the norms that have evolved or been designed to suit the needs of earlier configurations of technology. The gap leads to extreme tension. In the Exponential Age, this divergence is ongoing—and it is everywhere.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-exponential-age-azeem-azhar-diversion-books-153033895.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fc33c625-62d6-4378-96a8-0e018d7c54c4</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 15:30:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634247215</ingested><modified>2021-10-14T21:33:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f4f0710-25f8-11ec-b9fb-08066930ce5e" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6f4f0710-25f8-11ec-b9fb-08066930ce5e" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/09/01: In this photo illustration, an Amazon logo seen displayed on a smartphone along with a shopping cart.

Dbrand <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22728936/dbrand-pulls-ps5-darkplates-from-sale-sony-threatens-legal-action">told <em>The Verge</em></a> it stopped selling its PS5 &quot;Darkplates&quot; after Sony issued a cease-and-desist letter earlier in the year threatening legal action over alleged design and trademark violations.

In a Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/q94jua/darkplates_are_dead_thanks_sony/">thread</a>, the company claimed it was submitting to the &quot;terrorists&#39; demands... for now.&quot; It believed customers had the right to modify hardware with third-party components, and speculated that Sony might be clamping down so that it can either sell its own covers or charge licensing fees. The company didn&#39;t definitively say it planned to resume sales, but did say it would &quot;talk soon.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whatever Dbrand&#39;s intentions, this takes away a major option (though <a href="https://www.customizemyplates.com/">not your only option</a>) for customizing the PS5. The question is whether or not Sony can completely halt third-party faceplate sales. After all, the faceplates are designed to be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-official-teardown-124857385.html">easily removable</a> and aren&#39;t much more than plastic sheets. Dbrand likened this to replacing a broken F-150 truck bumper with an aftermarket part — you have the right to choose the parts you use for fixes or cosmetic upgrades, and Ford can&#39;t sue simply because you&#39;re using an unofficial bumper. It won&#39;t be surprising if there&#39;s an eventual court battle over Sony&#39;s policy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dbrand-stops-ps5-faceplate-sales-150427894.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f69ee7c-8029-449b-9bc4-983728ce010c</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 15:04:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634396671</ingested><modified>2021-10-16T15:04:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/06d16c90-2e8c-11ec-bd8b-55b30ce078bc" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/06d16c90-2e8c-11ec-bd8b-55b30ce078bc" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dbrand]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dbrand's PS5 "Darkplate" faceplate]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dbrand's PS5 "Darkplate" faceplate]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA launches mission to explore Solar System 'fossils']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the more important missions to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-05-nasa-discover-lucy-psyche-asteroids.html">study the early Solar System</a> is now underway. NASA has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-ula-launch-lucy-mission-to-fossils-of-planet-formation">launched</a> Lucy, a robotic spacecraft that will be the agency&#39;s first to explore the Trojan asteroids trapped near Jupiter&#39;s Lagrange points.

Lucy will return to Earth for another gravity assist in 2024, and won&#39;t see any asteroids until it swings by the Donaldjohanson asteroid (near the main asteroid belt) in 2025. The probe first visits its first swarm of Trojan asteroids, ahead of Jupiter, in 2027. It will then make four flybys before visiting Earth for a third gravity assist in 2031. It will finally visit the second swarm of asteroids in 2033.</p><p>You won&#39;t have to be quite so patient for every asteroid mission, at least. NASA will launch another explorer, Psyche, in 2022. The vehicle will arrive at the metallic asteroid (16) Psyche in 2026 and spend 21 months determining whether it represents the exposed core of an early planet or &#39;just&#39; unmelted material. Lucy is the more ambitious of the two projects, though, and it may pay extra dividends if it sheds light on how the Solar System came to be.</p><div id="2a52d4837ec2486b88ea6ca04e3963c7"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C0qcstDJErk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-lucy-mission-jupiter-trojan-asteroids-135712700.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b7dcb9b2-04c8-4ad4-b689-fdde199ad4ef</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 13:57:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634392635</ingested><modified>2021-10-16T13:57:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8ac3cf30-2e81-11ec-bd8f-b834e1b4fe2d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8ac3cf30-2e81-11ec-bd8f-b834e1b4fe2d" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Southwest Research Institute]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA Lucy probe explores a Jupiter Trojan asteroid]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA Lucy probe explores a Jupiter Trojan asteroid]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surprise Soyuz thruster firing tilted and turned the ISS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/russia-leaving-iss-own-space-station-133854949.html">International Space Station</a> had to initiate emergency protocols after the spacecraft tilted and turned by 57 degrees on Friday. All is well now, but the Roscosmos and NASA ground teams had to spring to action and alert their personnel in space after noticing the change in orientation. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/science/international-space-station-russia.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, the incident happened while cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky was testing the engines aboard the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft that&#39;s currently docked with the station.&nbsp;</p><p>NASA spokesperson Leah Cheshier told the publication that &quot;the thruster firing unexpectedly continued&quot; when the engine testing was scheduled to end. By 5:13 AM Eastern time, the ISS lost control of its orbital positioning. Russian controllers in Moscow immediately told Novitsky that the station turned 57 degrees, while NASA&#39;s mission control in Houston told its astronauts to begin emergency procedures. Flight controllers were able to regain control of the station around 30 minutes later. The Soyuz spacecraft that caused the incident is expected to fly a Russian fillm crew — that same one that flew to the ISS to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/international-space-station-russia-movie-the-challenge-183808670.html">shoot the first feature film</a> there earlier this month — back to Earth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;During the Soyuz MS-18 engines testing, the station’s orientation was impacted. As a result, the International Space Station orientation was temporarily changed.

The station and the crew are in no danger,&quot; Roscosmos said in its <a href="http://en.roscosmos.ru/22425/">announcement</a>.</p><p>As <em>The Times</em> notes, this is the second such emergency on the station. Back in July, the thrusters on Russia&#39;s Nauka module <a href="https://www.space.com/nauka-module-thruster-fire-tilts-space-station">fired</a> &quot;inadvertently and unexpectedly&quot; causing the ISS to tilt by about 45 degrees. At the time, NASA spokesperson Rob Navias said the ISS lost &quot;attitude control,&quot; which is also what happened in this case, and that the event was quite rare.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/soyuz-spacecraft-thruster-firing-turned-iss-122409715.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">89389c4d-0369-41d0-b7c5-b5d5b1ba99f4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 16 Oct 2021 12:24:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634387053</ingested><modified>2021-10-16T12:24:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Engineering]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8a109be0-2e6d-11ec-86be-a96de0b92cac" width="4187" height="2481" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8a109be0-2e6d-11ec-86be-a96de0b92cac" width="4187" height="2481" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[dima_zel via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[International space station on orbit of the Earth planet.

Back in 2017, officials <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-29-moscow-cctv-facial-recognition.html">added</a> facial recognition tech to the city&#39;s 170,000 security cameras as part of its efforts to ID criminals on the street. Activists filed a case against Moscow&#39;s Department of Technology a few years later in hopes of convincing the courts to ban the use of the technology. However, a court in Moscow <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-04-russian-court-facial-recognition-tech-privacy-ruling.html">sided</a> with the city, deciding that its use of facial recognition does not violate the privacy of citizens. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-politics-navalny-tech-idUSKBN2AB1U2"><em>Reuters</em></a> reported earlier this year, though, that those cameras were also used to identify protesters who attended rallies.</p><p>Stanislav Shakirov, the founder of Roskomsvoboda, a group that aims to protect Russians&#39; digital rights, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We are moving closer to authoritarian countries like China that have mastered facial technology.

The firm says much of that is due to component shortages that made it impossible for those companies to meet consumer demand.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://canalys.com/newsroom/canalys-global-smartphone-market-Q3-2021"><ins>preliminary estimate</ins></a>, Samsung shipped the most devices in Q3 2021, claiming a 23 percent share of the market. For the South Korean company, the good news is that it’s no worse off now than it was a year ago. Reclaiming the second spot, Apple managed to increase its share of the market by 3 percentage points year-over-year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7e83dd8214764547bfa2139b16644289"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">🌐📱Q321 smartphones down 6%<br><br>👉 Vendors struggled to meet demand for devices amid component shortages. <br>👉 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Samsung?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Samsung</a> - 23% share. <br>👉 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Apple</a> - 15% share<br>👉 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xiaomi?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xiaomi</a> - 14% share<br> 👉 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vivo?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#vivo</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OPPO?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OPPO</a> took 10% each<a href="https://t.co/iWSEvOk4PY">https://t.co/iWSEvOk4PY</a></p>— Canalys (@Canalys) <a href="https://twitter.com/Canalys/status/1449017906310918145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Rounding out the top five are a trio of Chinese manufacturers: Xiaomi, Vivo and Oppo. Together, they claimed a 34 percent slice of the market. One thing to note about the way Canalys does things is that it includes <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oneplus-oppo-merging-bbk-electronics-pete-lau-141928142.html"><ins>OnePlus shipments under Oppo</ins></a>, but doesn’t group Oppo with sister company Vivo. All three are owned by Chinese conglomerate BBK Electronics. When you think about things that way, it’s usually only second to Samsung as the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world.</p><p>Still, Apple’s performance is impressive when you consider its Q3 numbers only include about one week of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html%5C"><ins>iPhone 13</ins></a> sales. Canalys didn’t speak to the company’s numbers specifically, but it’s likely the strength of Apple’s supply chain helped it thrive in a challenging market. The company is one of TSMC’s most important customers, commanding a sizeable portion of its chip output.</p><p>“The chipset famine has truly arrived,” said Canalys Principal Analyst Ben Stanton. “The smartphone industry is striving to maximize production of devices as best it can.” The problem is that the supply shortage is expected to continue well into 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canalys-smartphone-shipments-q3-2021-190214915.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e1461f6a-f13a-4b51-8819-5ad39aa125b7</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 19:02:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634324541</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T19:02:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f42439e0-1eed-11ec-8b73-9a109939072e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f42439e0-1eed-11ec-8b73-9a109939072e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 in Starlight color]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 13 in Starlight color]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitch says no passwords were leaked in security breach]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>No <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/twitch/"><ins>Twitch</ins></a> passwords were exposed in the livestreaming service&#39;s recent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitch-data-breach-reveals-creator-payouts-source-code-and-more-112012011.html"><ins>major security breach</ins></a>, according to the company.

They&#39;ve created a smart fiber that can sense and respond to the movement of its wearer. <a href="http://doi.org/10.1145/3472749.3474802">Dubbed OmniFiber</a>, the soft robotic fabric features a hollow center channel that allows a fluidic medium to travel through it. With the help of compressed air, the fibers can bend, stretch, curl and pulse on demand. That&#39;s something that allows them to provide tactile feedback in real-time, making them akin to an artificial muscle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Artificial muscle fibers aren&#39;t a new idea; other <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2019/artificial-fiber-muscles-0711"><ins>research teams at MIT</ins></a> have approached the technology in their own way. However, what makes OmniFiber notable is that it doesn&#39;t need heat to change its shape. Immediately that makes it more practical since overheating the skin is not an issue. It has other advantages too. It&#39;s possible to make the fabric with relatively inexpensive materials, and the fibers don&#39;t require a delicate weaving process.</p><p>The team envisions their fabric making its way into garments that could help teach athletes and singers how to control their breathing better. Another even more exciting application could see an OmniFiber garment help someone recover their natural breathing pattern after a respiratory disease like COVID-19.</p><p>It may be some time before we see OmniFiber make its way into the real world, but that&#39;s not to suggest the project is done. <a href="https://www.media.mit.edu/people/ozgun/overview/"><ins>Ozgun Kilic Afsar</ins></a>, one of the researchers who worked on the fabric, told <em>MIT News</em> she plans to continue working on the system. Among the things she wants to do is develop a manufacturing system that allows the creation of even longer filaments.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-omnifiber-172907843.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06296aa2-83d0-424c-8f37-b172d19923c0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 17:29:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634318953</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T17:29:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8d391960-2ddb-11ec-bfaf-2b3290ffe6ab" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8d391960-2ddb-11ec-bfaf-2b3290ffe6ab" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[MIT News]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OmniFiber]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OmniFiber]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Steam bans games that allow cryptocurrency and NFT trading]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/steam/"><ins>Steam</ins></a> will no longer allow games that enable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/nft/"><ins>NFT</ins></a> (non-fungible token) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/cryptocurrency/"><ins>cryptocurrency</ins></a> trading through the blockchain.

Apple&#39;s primary goal is to merge its HomePod and Apple TV hardware, according to Gurman.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple is holding its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-what-to-expect-october-18-unleashed-142518973.html">Unleashed</a> event on Monday, where it&#39;s expected to launch new MacBooks and possibly AirPods, but there&#39;s no rumors of a new HomePod product coming any time soon.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-hires-a-new-home-pod-software-lead-amid-speaker-market-struggles-161509987.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0831c09f-0771-40d3-afe4-6911ce31f844</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 16:15:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634314188</ingested><modified>2021-10-15T16:09:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41ef44d0-2dd0-11ec-bebb-4490cce00e0b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/41ef44d0-2dd0-11ec-bebb-4490cce00e0b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple hires a new HomePod software lead amid speaker market struggles]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple hires a new HomePod software lead amid speaker market struggles]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weight loss app Noom gets into mental health coaching]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since 2011, <a href="https://www.noom.com/programs/health-weight/exsf01d/?upv=3&amp;sp=google&amp;utm_source=g&amp;utm_medium=paidsearch&amp;utm_campaign=6465453559&amp;utm_content=379508920522&amp;utm_term=aud-634016527096:kwd-299095591416%7Cnoom&amp;gid=80088673889%7C&amp;type=branded%7Cintent%7Ce&amp;cid=CjwKCAjwzaSLBhBJEiwAJSRokhvAoudw7D9gHYG4L_TK9aBeYv5O_VD8SZqIYA65_CosFG9dvoL2hRoCqc0QAvD_BwE&amp;pos=&amp;step=pros&amp;lang=en&amp;device=c&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwzaSLBhBJEiwAJSRokhvAoudw7D9gHYG4L_TK9aBeYv5O_VD8SZqIYA65_CosFG9dvoL2hRoCqc0QAvD_BwE">Noom</a> has made a name for itself as a weight loss app. This week, with the introduction of a new feature called <a href="https://noom.com/mood">Noom Mood</a>, it’s expanding into mental wellness.

Along the way, you’ll be asked to log your mood, and if you ever need additional help, the program includes access to a personal coach.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It’s not surprising to see Noom expand beyond weight loss.
