That&#39;s mostly due to the fact that properly <a href="https://pitchfork.com/thepitch/dj-sets-livestreaming-economics-electronic-music-coronavirus/">sorting out royalties</a> for all the samples is a nightmare. You can find them on platforms like SoundCloud (unless they get taken down), but these songs can have literally hundreds of rights holders between the DJ, original artist, labels and even a festival or venue. To remedy the problem, and to massively expand the amount of DJ-mixed content on the platform, Apple worked with both major and independent labels on a system that identifies and directly pays rights holders on a mix. What&#39;s more, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-25-apples-purchase-of-shazam-is-400-million-well-spent.html">leveraged Shazam technology</a> to do it for Apple Music.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple explains that its new tool will let the streaming service ID and compensate individual creators in a DJ mix, even artists who recorded any sampled tunes. It&#39;s also the first major streaming service to do so. In collaboration with DJs themselves alongside festivals, clubs, promoters, curators and independent labels, the company says it&#39;s working with all parties involved to ensure fair compensation. Apple says this will give DJ mixes a longer shelf life when it comes to revenue since individual tracks, collections, compilations and even full festival sets will be available to stream like studio albums on Apple Music.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/boiler-room-brings-mixes-to-apple-music-touting-novel-royalty-model/">thousands of DJ mixes on Apple Music already</a>, and the service says it&#39;s adding more all the time. The company has already commissioned mixes for Black Music Month and Pride in addition to housing content from Tomorrowland&#39;s 2020 and 2021 digital festivals. Thanks to this new system, there&#39;s about to be a lot more to choose from.&nbsp;</p><p>Starting this Friday, !K7&#39;s DJ-Kicks archive will be available for streaming. The label explains that 14 of those editions haven&#39;t been &quot;in the market&quot; for more than 15 years. Previously unavailable for streaming, Tomorrowland performances from Alesso, Charlotte de Witte, David Guetta, Diplo, Major Lazer, Martin Garrix, The Chainsmokers, TiÃ«sto and more will be easily accessible. Mixmag is opening up its vault as well, and livestream platform Cercle will have a dedicated hub on Apple Music where listeners can stream archived mixes and live performances. And yes, much of this will be available for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-lossless-dolby-atmos-131659010.html">lossless streaming</a> and you&#39;ll be able to listen offline too.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Apple has dabbled in managing royalties for DJ mixes. In 2016, the company began <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-15-apple-music-remixes-dj-songs-dubset-mixbank.html">working with Dubset</a> to bring previously unlicensed content to Apple Music. Dubset used a Gracenote database of clips to identify and assign rights. The system even allowed original artists to prohibit their songs from being used in mixes and to limit how much of a track could be repurposed. Dubset was <a href="https://pex.com/blog/pex-acquires-dubset-media/">purchased by Pex in 2020</a>, where the system is used to scan social media audio and video content for unlicensed material. Apple&#39;s new Shazam-based setup, on the other hand, compares all parts of a mix to Apple Music&#39;s library of 75 million songs.</p><p>As you can imagine, all of the new content will be easy to find. Apple says DJs will have artist pages, if they don&#39;t already for any original music. And while the focus is on DJ mixes for now, the company says this system can be applied widely, for things like assigning royalties for hip-hop remixes and more.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-music-dj-mixes-shazam-royalties-040033781.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8ce1cae7-47b5-4e71-bbde-6c05fdcac5c5</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 10 Sep 2021 04:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631245841</ingested><modified>2021-09-10T03:50:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5f5f19a0-11ba-11ec-bbff-1bca0740ee2e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5f5f19a0-11ba-11ec-bbff-1bca0740ee2e" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Music DJ]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Music DJ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Vivo's X70 Pro+ does optical stabilization on all four rear cameras]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/vivo">Vivo</a> brand may not immediately ring a bell in the West, but its recent mobile photography ambitions are worth paying attention to. The company&#39;s latest flagship, the X70 Pro+, is the world&#39;s first smartphone to feature optical image stabilization (OIS) across all four of its rear cameras. Like the <a href="https://www.vivo.com/en/products/x60proplus">previous model</a>, these all have Zeiss optics and Zeiss T* lens coating, but the main camera is further enhanced by an SLR-grade high-transmittance glass lens to reduce chromatic aberration.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6d6117a0-119d-11ec-bbfd-9b10985f4e6a" alt="Vivo X70 Pro+ camera app" data-uuid="6504d06b-66e2-3d99-a6a2-dca28598f92c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivo</div></figure><p>Vivo continues to offer one of the more versatile sets of cameras I&#39;ve seen lately. The X70 Pro+ comes with a 48-megapixel f/2.2 ultra-wide camera, which is further stabilized by Vivo&#39;s now-signature <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivo-x50-pro-gimbal-camera-samsung-s20-ultra-review-comparison-153039220.html">micro gimbal</a>; a 50-megapixel f/1.57 main camera powered by a large <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-isocell-50-megapixel-dual-pixel-102059389.html">Samsung GN1</a> sensor (as featured on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vivo-x50-pro-gimbal-camera-stabilization-152138632.html">X50 Pro+</a>); a 12-megapixel f/1.6 portrait camera with the much newer Sony IMX663; and an 8-megapixel f/3.4 5x zoom periscopic camera.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All four rear cameras support electronic stabilization for video shooting, and if you <em>really</em> want to, the main camera can film at up to 8K resolution. The X70 Pro+ also packs Vivo&#39;s very own &quot;V1&quot; AI imaging chip for better noise reduction in low-light video recording, as well as more efficient motion smoothing in video playback and gaming.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/18e79a30-119a-11ec-ae2c-f0992addd2b9"><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>I don&#39;t usually spend much time in the camera filter section, but Vivo&#39;s selection of bokeh effects look fun, as they were apparently meant to mimic classic Zeiss lenses. The X60 series already introduced the &quot;swirly&quot; Biotar filter, and with the new X70 series, you also get the &quot;anamorphic&quot; Distagon, the &quot;genuine&quot; Planar and the &quot;creamy&quot; Sonnar. Apparently Zeiss took part in developing these bokeh effects, so that should speak for their faithfulness.</p><p>On the other side of the X70 Pro+, you get a 32-megapixel f/2.45 punch-hole selfie camera at the top of a 6.78-inch screen. This 3,200 x 1,400 AMOLED panel offers better colors (10-bit or 1 billion colors) and brightness than before, thanks to Samsung&#39;s latest E5 LTPO tech. It also delivers a refresh rate of up to 120Hz and a touch sampling rate of up to 300Hz, which should deliver some silky smooth scrolling and gaming.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d98b66f0-118f-11ec-a7fd-bffd859ed291" alt="Vivo X70 Pro+ display" data-uuid="b9b166d9-e55c-3e66-ab26-e1798429b599"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivo</div></figure><p>The Android 11-based X70 Pro+ comes with many other flagship elements, namely a Qualcomm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-plus-5g-131035082.html">Snapdragon 888+</a> processor, fast LPDDR5 RAM, IP68 dustproofing and waterproofing, stereo speakers and a dedicated Hi-Fi chip. There&#39;s even an infrared remote feature to let you control home appliances the old-fashioned way.</p><p>As for charging, the 4,500mAh battery here supports Vivo&#39;s 55W FlashCharge and 50W Wireless FlashCharge. The latter requires a special charging stand, which packs two coils to handle both portrait and landscape orientations. You can also use any Qi pad, with the trade-off being a slower charging rate, obviously. The phone itself does 10W reverse wireless charging, should you need to revive other phones, smartwatches or wireless earbuds.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3bcaec00-1190-11ec-bf73-94505a8ddc8a" alt="Vivo X70 Series" data-uuid="9c9598d9-fa79-31a1-ac28-f07572a12d2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivo</div></figure><p>The X70 series includes two other models: the quad-cam X70 Pro and the tri-cam X70. Both models are powered by MediaTek&#39;s Dimensity 1200-vivo chipset, and their smaller 6.56-inch AMOLED screens (2,376 x 1,080, 120Hz) translate to smaller batteries as well. But hey, you still get an infrared remote on either model.</p><p>While the X70 Pro and X70 also receive the Zeiss treatment, they baked the micro gimbal into their main cameras (50 and 40 megapixels, respectively) instead of their 12-megapixel ultra-wide cameras. It&#39;s also worth mentioning that their 12-megapixel portrait cameras lack OIS. Given their missing V1 imaging chip, it&#39;ll be interesting to compare their low-light shots with the X70 Pro+.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2a86de00-118f-11ec-8b4f-5cc18301cb46" alt="Vivo X70 Pro and X70 Pro Plus" data-uuid="f84c7e22-6f63-36fe-8474-c45cb3d4dd30"><figcaption>Vivo X60 Pro and X60 Pro+.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Vivo</div></figure><p>For what it&#39;s worth, the version of the X70 Pro sold in China will be powered by a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-first-five-nanometer-exynos-1080-120528283.html">Samsung Exynos 1080</a>, and it also includes a V1 chip.</p><p>Outside of China, Vivo&#39;s X70 series will initially roll out in markets like India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan and the United Arab Emirates, among others. There&#39;s no word on a European launch just yet, but Vivo might want to plan one soon to keep up with the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-second-largest-phone-brand-q2-2021-141814474.html">Oppo and Xiaomi</a>.

Further, she was discouraged from using the company Slack where she&#39;d been openly criticizing Apple. Her complaints against the tech giant include being asked to make her tone less authoritative during presentations. She was also allegedly told that it was &quot;ok&quot; that she received complaints for her diversity training, including ones finding her &quot;too hard on the white man.&quot; The former Apple engineer also said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ashleygjovik/status/1423656657372934147?s=20">tweet</a> that the company told her it was &quot;fine&quot; that a male director colleague asked her out for drinks and talked about cheating on his wife and mistresses entire time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>By the end of August, GjÃ¸vik <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-faces-us-labor-board-investigation-083212877.html">filed a complaint</a> against Apple with the US National Labor Relations Board, alleging 13 instances of retaliation against her.

After a stint at Adobe, he joined Apple in 2013 to oversee the companyâs wearable and health unit and has frequently been the one to present whatever new features Apple is working on for watchOS.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports Lynch joined the division earlier in the year but is now overseeing the entire unit. The outlet notes Lynchâs appointment suggests Apple is likely focusing on underlying software that a self-driving car would need to navigate the road, instead of a vehicle that we could see the company release anytime soon.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-appoints-kevin-lynch-car-division-223033138.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d1effe3f-305c-4830-a38b-81e314333382</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 22:30:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631226046</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T22:20:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Board & Management Changes]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f5c413a0-11ba-11ec-a77d-6de66c43b016" width="3900" height="2600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f5c413a0-11ba-11ec-a77d-6de66c43b016" width="3900" height="2600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BRITTANY HOSEA-SMALL via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's vice president of technology Kevin Lynch speaks during the keynote address during Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) in San Jose, California on June 3, 2019.

As expected, it look like <em>God of War</em>, with the familiar dual-weapon wielding that Kratos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-12-god-of-war-review.html">excelled at in the 2018 game</a>. His son, Atreus, looks like he&#39;s grown up in the last few years, and he&#39;s challenging his dear old dad&#39;s decisions as well as proving to be a more capable fighter.</p><p>As for the game&#39;s story, it looks to be setting up a conflict with the Norse pantheon of gods â just as Kratos destroyed all of the Greek gods in the first trilogy of games, he might be on that path again here. But he&#39;s definitely fighting it, while Atreus sounds like the one who is more convinced that full-on war is necessary here. As noted in an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/09/first-look-at-god-of-war-ragnarok/">extensive blog post</a> about the new game, a lot of the conflict seems to come from Atreus trying to understand what his now-dead mother wanted for him, after it was revealed he was part-giant at the end of the first game.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="fc97bae0dba54c75b9d451ce78bea5a6"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EE-4GvjKcfs" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>As for the enemies, Freya, an ally-turned-foe, will be a main antagonist, as will Thor. We only saw brief teases of each character, but both characters have lost family to Kratos and Atreus, and they seem about as thirsty for revenge as Kratos used to be when he was a Greek god. Particularly intriguing is the news that veteran actor Richard Schiff (<em>The West Wing) </em>will play Odin, king of the Norse gods.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, the game looks fantastic, with a variety of new environments and enemies as well as more ways to use Kratos&#39; Leviathan Axe and Blades of Chaos. But the familiar boat returns, as does the disembodied head Mimir, so get ready for more story time and cutting remarks about Kratos&#39; perpetually grumpy mood.</p><p>Sony unfortunately didn&#39;t have a release date to share; a year ago, the company said <em>God of War RagnarÃ¶k </em>would arrive in 2021, but the blog post said &quot;see you next year&quot; at its end.</p><p>We did learn in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8Km-KXrXec">post-show interview</a> that Eric Williams, a longtime Santa Monica Studio veteran will be directing <em>God of War RagnarÃ¶k</em>, rather than Cory Barlog, who helmed the 2018 title. Williams has worked on every God of War title so far, so he seems a logical choice for the job. Williams mentioned that each game has historically had a different director, with Barlog the only one doing two installments. &quot;You&#39;re really exhausted at the end of finishing one of these things,&quot; Barlog said, &quot;so you&#39;ve gotta con someone else into doing it, like him.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-first-footage-205908760.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">78d611bc-bba4-45d1-892f-31747b2c5630</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 20:59:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631222094</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T21:15:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/fb603ce0-11af-11ec-9fec-f6529cd97aac" width="2783" height="1614" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/563e9120-11b0-11ec-afef-572f4cc886ae" width="2176" height="1224" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[God of War: Ragnarok]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[God of War: Ragnarok]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Marvel's Spider-Man 2' brings Venom to PlayStation 5 in 2023]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony is working on not one but two new Marvel games.

Houseparty is <a href="https://houseparty.com/blog/saying-goodbye-to-houseparty/">shutting down</a> its app sometime in October. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/houseparty-fortnite-video-chat-pc-ps4-ps5-announcement-110027836.html"><em>Fortnite&#39;s</em> Houseparty integration</a> will vanish around the same time, the developers said. The app has already disappeared from stores.</p><p>The team explained the move as a matter of focus. Houseparty is crafting &quot;meaningful and authentic&quot; new socialization features that would be useful at a metaverse level across Epic Games titles, according to the creators. The company didn&#39;t provide any clues as to what would come next.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s a slightly odd decision. Epic bought Houseparty in 2019, and the app bloomed in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic forced many people to socialize online. There were over 17 million downloads in March 2020 alone, Sensor Tower <a href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/houseparty-statistics/">said</a>. The <em>Fortnite</em> tie-in also gave the younger crowd a way to hang out in a favorite game.

But perhaps most pertinent to the company&#39;s employees was an announcement that it&#39;s delaying their return to the office <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-delays-office-reopening-covid-19-215417217.html">yet again</a>. Microsoft is putting the plans on hold indefinitely due to the COVID-19 delta variant.</p><p>Most recently, the aim was to fully reopen the headquarters in Redmond, Washington and several other US offices no earlier than October 4th. &quot;Given the uncertainty of COVID-19, weâve decided against attempting to forecast a new date for a full reopening of our US work sites in favor of opening US work sites as soon as weâre able to do so safely based on public health guidance.&quot; Jared Spataro, Microsoft&#39;s corporate vice president for modern work, <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/09/09/microsoft-and-linkedin-share-latest-data-and-innovation-for-hybrid-work/">wrote in a blog post</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Once Microsoft has a date in mind for reopening, it will tell workers about a 30-day transition period so they can make preparations. That window, according to Spataro, will let Microsoft &quot;continue to be agile and flexible as we look to the data and make choices to protect employee health, safety and well-being.&quot; As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/09/business/microsoft-rto-delta-variant.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimesbits"><em>The New York Times</em></a> notes, Microsoft will require employees, vendors and guests to have proof of vaccination before being allowed to enter its offices.</p><p>&quot;Itâs a stark reminder that this is the new normal,&quot; Spataro wrote. &quot;Our ability to come together will ebb and flow.&quot;</p><p>With that in mind, it seems Microsoft employees will be taking advantage of the hybrid meeting features that are coming to Teams. They include support for intelligent cameras; more immersive PowerPoint presentations with live video in slides; a way to tell co-workers if you plan to attend meetings in person or remotely when you RSVP; and Apple CarPlay support for audio-only meetings.</p><p>Other major tech companies have delayed returns to the office. Amazon previously planned to bring corporate employees back to its offices this week. In August, it pushed back those plans once again, this time <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-delays-hq-office-return-until-2022-amid-covid-19-surge-055819058.html">until January</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-office-return-delay-indefinite-covid-19-delta-191909008.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">351b292f-b30a-402b-a23d-c432cca57edd</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 19:19:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631217391</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T19:56:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/35620aa0-11a0-11ec-9bbb-718496d26308" width="5242" height="3395" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/35620aa0-11a0-11ec-9bbb-718496d26308" width="5242" height="3395" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Brashear via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[REDMOND, WASHINGTON - JULY 17: A building on the Microsoft Headquarters campus is pictured July 17, 2014 in Redmond, Washington.

The facility will capture 4,000 tons of CO2 per year, and it&#39;s &#39;permanently&#39; removed from the environment, not recycled.</p><p>A carbon offset isn&#39;t a trivial purchase. It currently costs $600 per ton for bulk requests, and as high as $1,200 for eco-friendly individuals. Climeworks hopes to shrink the cost to $300 or less per ton by 2030 as it ramps up its overall capacity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Orca represents an important milestone for actively reducing humanity&#39;s carbon footprint, it&#39;s not much to brag about at this stage â if anything, it reveals just how far the technology has to go. That 4,000 tons of capture is equal to just 250 US residents, half the total capture output in the world, and nowhere near matching Climeworks&#39; initial plan to capture 300 million tons (1 percent of the world&#39;s emissions) by 2025. The company now expects to reach 500,000 tons per year by 2030.</p><p>There are still reasons to be optimistic. Demand is very high, according to Climeworks, to the point where the company plans to expand Orca tenfold in the next three years. Lower carbon reduction prices could also accelerate adoption by tempting companies that would otherwise pay penalties when they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/europe-21-years-behind-emissions-goals-enel-study-180121943.html">can&#39;t meet emissions targets</a>. This won&#39;t be a true substitute for reducing CO2 output, but it could help mitigate the impact in the short term.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/worlds-largest-carbon-capture-plant-185556109.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb954aa9-b2fd-443f-bf8b-b97d42f05e69</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 18:55:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631214852</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T19:14:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Basic Materials Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2b974d80-1198-11ec-9bfc-8ba21f637771" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2b974d80-1198-11ec-9bfc-8ba21f637771" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Climeworks]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Climeworks Orca carbon capture plant in Iceland]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Climeworks Orca carbon capture plant in Iceland]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM extends Bolt EV factory shutdown amid battery pack shortage]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>General Motors canât seem to catch a break.

The facility is where the company makes its Chevy Bolt electric vehicles. It was one of the assembly plants GM shut down last week â though it did so because of the recent Bolt <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-recalls-bolt-evs-once-again-over-fire-risks-154033780.html"><ins>recall</ins></a>, not the chip shortage that affected its other factories.</p><p>Per <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/gm-extends-michigan-plant-shutdown-over-bolt-ev-recall-2021-09-09/"><em><ins>Reuters</ins></em></a>, GM expects the shutdown to continue until at least September 24th. The company blamed battery pack shortages for the extended halt to production. GM added it wonât resume Bolt manufacturing or sales until itâs sure it has addressed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-chevy-bolt-fire-warning-215322969.html"><ins>fire concerns</ins></a> that forced it to recall the vehicle in the first place.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Itâs the latest setback in a series of setbacks for GM when it comes to the Bolt.

After two Bolt EVs included in the companyâs 2020 recall caught fire recently, GM issued a second recall. It then widened that action to include more than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-expands-fire-risk-recall-all-chevy-bolt-115934063.html"><ins>140,000 vehicles globally</ins></a>.

To that end, the search giant says it will use freshwater alternatives to cool its server farms. In places like Douglas County, Georgia, the company already uses reclaimed wastewater to keep its servers running.

Google points to its Bay Area campuses and a <a href="https://www.gstatic.com/gumdrop/sustainability/2018-ecology-book.pdf">landscaping project</a> where it worked with local ecologists as an example of an initiative where it&#39;s already thinking about its water use.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Our water stewardship journey will involve continuously enhancing our water use and consumption,&quot; said Google sustainability officer Kate Brandt in a <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/replenishing-water/">blog post</a>.</p><p>In its efforts to replenish more water than it consumes, the company says it will also invest in community projects working to address local water and watershed challenges in places where the company has data centers and offices. As an example of the work Google plans to do here, the company points to a partnership it already has in place with the <a href="https://www.crit-nsn.gov/">Colorado River Indian Tribes</a> to reduce the amount of water removed from Lake Mead. The reservoir, the largest in the US, faces a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/aug/16/lake-mead-drought-reservoir-water-level-cuts">pressing water shortage</a> due to a combination of overuse and extended drought.</p><p>Lastly, the company plans to continue working with communities, policymakers and planners to help them with tools and technologies they need to measure and predict water availability and needs. Here, the company references work it did with the United Nations Environment Programme to create the <a href="https://www.sdg661.app/">Freshwater Ecosystems Explorer</a>.

Pichai described the effort as a &quot;moonshot,&quot; noting it would be tricky in some instances to achieve due to the remote location of some of Google&#39;s facilities.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-water-stewardship-pledge-2030-171248761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">43c95bef-8b4d-4bec-a57d-8f1581aeb0a0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 17:12:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631207572</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T17:13:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Water Resources]]></category><category><![CDATA[Natural Resources]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/47c0b590-118f-11ec-beaf-3766a773e7c9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/47c0b590-118f-11ec-beaf-3766a773e7c9" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google data center]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google data center]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft Teams is getting hybrid meeting features, including CarPlay support]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/covid-19"><ins>COVID-19</ins></a> pandemic caused a huge shift toward remote working, though many people are still eager to return to the office. As such, the future of work may be a hybrid environment. To help account for that, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/microsoft%20teams"><ins>Microsoft Teams</ins></a> is <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/09/09/brace-yourselves-hybrid-work-is-hard-heres-how-microsoft-teams-and-office-365-can-help/"><ins>getting</ins></a> a bunch of features to bolster hybrid meetings.</p><p>Among these is the Cameo feature for presentations in PowerPoint Live. You&#39;ll be able to add your Teams camera feed to your deck, and you can choose how and where you want to appear in slides. Microsoft plans to roll out this tool early next year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c101f4e0-118b-11ec-bbc7-802b6b8d4315" style="height:1020;width:1918;" alt="Microsoft Teams" data-uuid="69faac0b-bcdc-3e98-afb2-ef71d3786ab6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Also arriving in early 2022 is an AI-powered feature called speaker coach, which listens to your speech and offers tips on your pace and when to check in with the attendees, as well as offering a reminder when you interrupt someone.</p><p>Microsoft will add an automatic lighting correction tool in the coming months. In the same timeframe, it will update companion mode in Teams mobile. The latter will let in-person attendees have easy access to features such as chat and live reactions, as well as controls for the meeting and connected devices, such as cameras.</p><p>Speaking of which, Microsoft Teams will soon <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-teams-blog/prepare-offices-for-hybrid-work-with-new-experiences-on/ba-p/2709599"><ins>support intelligent cameras</ins></a> from the likes of Jabra, Neat, Poly, and Yealink. AI-powered active speaker tracking will use visual cues as well as audio to help determine who is speaking and focus on them. Multiple video streams will place meeting participants who are in the same physical space into their own video pane. The people recognition tool, meanwhile, can identify meeting participants and display their profile name below their video pane.</p><p>Manufacturers will have access to those features in the coming months. Microsoft expects the tools to roll out as updates over the next year. They could play a key role in putting all hybrid meeting participants on a level playing field, whether they&#39;re at home or in a conference room.</p><p>Elsewhere, an Outlook RSVP feature that&#39;ll arrive in early 2022 will let you flag whether you&#39;re attending a meeting in person or remotely to help organizers prepare (Google Calendar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-calendar-invite-rsvp-options-114518372.html"><ins>added a similar feature in July</ins></a>). You&#39;ll be able to mark when and where you&#39;re working in your working hours too. You may also be able to reserve shared workspaces through Outlook or Teams.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/apple%20carplay">Apple CarPlay</a> will get audio-only support for Teams starting later this month. So, if you get stuck in traffic when a meeting starts, you can still join in via Siri.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bdebdb40-118b-11ec-9dd7-086cabadc66a" style="height:266;width:445;" alt="Microsoft Teams on Apple CarPlay" data-uuid="c92400ad-a466-32c2-8a4b-138baf42d736"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-teams-hybrid-meetings-features-apple-carplay-intelligent-cameras-164625137.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9cb131bf-cf08-4975-8d21-5851d5951cdf</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 16:46:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631205988</ingested><modified>2021-09-09T16:46:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Loans]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b83f1130-118b-11ec-bda3-9669808155e4" width="1200" height="600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b83f1130-118b-11ec-bda3-9669808155e4" width="1200" height="600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft Teams]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft Teams]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
