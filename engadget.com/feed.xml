A group of 200 artists and 30 rights groups has penned an <a href="https://www.amazondoesntrock.com/">open letter</a> demanding the Red Rocks amphitheater, its ticketing provider AXS and AEG (AXS&#39; parent company) &quot;immediately cancel&quot; contracts to use Amazon One scanning at any venue. They also want the firms to ban all biometric surveillance at those events.</p><p>The opponents to Amazon&#39;s palm tech include figures you&#39;d recognize, such as Rage Against the Machine&#39;s Tom Morello and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-18-bikini-kill-on-streaming-services.html">Bikini Kill&#39;s</a> Kathleen Hanna. The groups include organizations ranging from the immigrant-oriented United We Dream through to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-07-09-tor-project-is-being-sued-for-enabling-a-revenge-porn-site.html">Tor Project</a>. The digital rights group Fight for the Future is leading the initiative.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The letter contributors are worried Amazon might send palm data to government agencies hoping to track activists and marginalized people, particularly in light of its past <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rekognition-police-ban-222425615.html">collaborations with police</a>. They&#39;re also concerned thieves might steal info from the cloud, and see AEG as inconsistent after it condemned the use of facial recognition in 2019.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked AEG and Red Rocks operators for comment. There are no guarantees the letter will convince anyone to drop Amazon One. The tech theoretically helps get people into a venue sooner, and might reassure concertgoers nervous about physical contact while the pandemic lingers. The objectors have some support, though — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senators-amazon-palm-print-data-investigation-134424558.html">US senators are also worried</a> Amazon might abuse palm data. The combined pressure might make life uncomfortable for palm scanning&#39;s backers, even if they ultimately decide to move forward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/artist-rights-groups-protest-amazon-palm-tech-100024591.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ccb4e8fc-b6b5-4dc6-a5e9-b2d44b159d32</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 10:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637101464</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T22:24:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d2b30640-4726-11ec-bedb-6cf650f8c953" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d2b30640-4726-11ec-bedb-6cf650f8c953" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon One palm scanner]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon One palm scanner]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Fujifilm's Instax Mini Evo camera lets you send snaps directly to your phone]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Fujifilm has <a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/jp/en/news/hq/7203">unveiled</a> the Instax Mini Evo, its new flagship instant film camera with a premium build, higher resolution than previous models and improved smartphone integration. As with other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilms-latest-instax-printer-can-handle-wider-photos-085523243.html">Instax cameras</a>, you can take photos and instantly develop them to Fujifilm&#39;s credit card-sized Instax Mini film, but it offers a number of features not available on previous models.&nbsp;</p><p>As a hybrid camera, you can review photos on the LCD monitor and choose the ones you want to print. However, the new model is the first Instax camera with a print lever and lens/film filter dials. That lets you take a picture then choose among 100 combinations of effects (including &quot;Soft Focus,&quot; &quot;Light Leak,&quot; &quot;Monochrome&quot; and &quot;Retro&quot;)  and print the image afterwards by pulling the print lever.

Finally, you can use your smartphone to take pictures remotely with the camera.&nbsp;</p><p>Fujifilm also unveiled a new Instax Mini film format called &quot;Stone Grey&quot; with a gray background.

In fact, fans outside the US and Canada will have to wait months to be able to see the new episodes — legally, that is — if they ever get the chance at all. According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/star-trek-discovery-netflix-deal-paramount-viacomcbs-1234875466/"><em>Deadline</em></a>, ViacomCBS has ended its deal with Netflix that had been in place since the series launched in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>The publication says the money Netflix paid for the show&#39;s overseas rights paid for most of Discovery&#39;s hefty budget. Now that ViacomCBS has paid off the deal, it also pulled the entire show from Netflix. Apparently, it plans make the series available again to international fans in 2022 when Paramount+ goes global. The UK, Germany, Ireland, Austria and Switzerland will be among the first regions to get access to the streaming service next year. By the end of 2022, the service will be out in 45 countries, but as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/star-trek-discovery-is-lost-to-most-of-the-world-days-1848069210"><em>Gizmodo</em></a> points out, that&#39;s still a tiny fraction of the 190 regions where Netflix is available.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Kelly Day, ViacomCBS Networks International streaming boss, told <em>Deadline</em>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;As we rapidly expand our global streaming footprint, we are bringing more of our top titles home to ViacomCBS for Paramount+ markets around the world. We have a strong global and local content pipeline that positions us for success across our regions, and repatriating beloved series like Star Trek: Discovery for Paramount+ is another step forward as we bring fans more must-watch series worldwide.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In a tweet, the show&#39;s official account said that the fourth season will still premiere on Paramount+ on November 18th in the US. Meanwhile, it will arrive on CTV Sci-Fi Channel in Canada on the same day and will be available for streaming in the country on Crave the day after.</p><div id="21ee13327d5b4d36bfbfbdc2932c279b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/uz0ReiYUMW">pic.twitter.com/uz0ReiYUMW</a></p>— Star Trek on Paramount+ (@StarTrekOnPPlus) <a href="https://twitter.com/StarTrekOnPPlus/status/1460714366265823239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 16, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-leaves-netflix-080929478.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3e2fcdb0-62eb-4ded-8512-5e2b726dcc95</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 08:09:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637136629</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T08:10:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/935fcee0-4778-11ec-bd79-fa479129d80a" width="1600" height="1049" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/935fcee0-4778-11ec-bd79-fa479129d80a" width="1600" height="1049" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Star Trek: Discovery]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Star Trek: Discovery]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Star Trek: Discovery]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Porsche unveils the Taycan GTS and Sport Turismo EVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Porsche has <a href="https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2021/products/porsche-taycan-gts-taycan-gts-sport-turismo-la-auto-show-26460.html#">unveiled</a> two new options for those looking to get one of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-04-porsche-taycan-ev-first-ride-tech.html">Taycan EVs</a>: A Taycan with the legendary GTS moniker and a third body model called the GTS Sport Turismo. Kevin Giek, VP of the Taycan model line, said the GTS &quot;is positioned above the Taycan 4S and below the Taycan Turbo derivatives, so it represents a real sweet spot in the range.&quot; As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/16/porsche-takes-the-gts-electric-with-the-taycan-sedan-and-sporty-wagon/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> notes, with the addition of these two, there are now 10 Taycan variants in all.</p><p>The luxury automaker calls the GTS version the &quot;sporty all-rounder&quot; of the line. It has a range of 504 km or 313 miles, making it the first Taycan to break the 500 km mark. The model&#39;s adaptive air suspension was specifically adapted to the GTS, and it has Black or dark details on the exterior — including the front apron, the bases of the exterior mirrors and the side window trims — as is traditional for a GTS car.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, the Taycan Sport Turismo is a mix between the Cross Turismo and the sports saloon, though it doesn&#39;t have off-road elements. It has the sporty silhouette and the rearward-sloping roofline of the Taycan Cross Turismo, and its rear headroom is 45mm (around 1.7 inches) greater than the Taycan sports saloon. Both the GTS and the Sport Turismo can go from 0 to 100 kmh (62 mph) within 3.7 seconds and have a maximum speed of 250 kmh (155mph).&nbsp;</p><p>The Taycan GTS and Sport Turismo will have prices that start at EUR131,834 (US$149,000)  and EUR132,786 (US$150,000), respectively. They will both be heading to dealers in the spring of 2022, and more engine options for the Sport Turismo will follow. Porsche will also be showcasing the new EVs at the LA Auto Show, which will take place from November 19th through the 28th, so we&#39;ll hear more about the new vehicles in the coming days.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/porsche-taycan-gts-sport-turismo-062707716.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">20cb8712-e02d-4280-8db1-6a09be223d84</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 17 Nov 2021 06:27:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637130487</ingested><modified>2021-11-17T06:28:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e64ec140-4766-11ec-bfdf-70c0221094ca" width="1600" height="986" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/e64ec140-4766-11ec-bfdf-70c0221094ca" width="1600" height="986" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Porsche]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Porsche]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Porsche]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix offers a clearer look at its top 10 rankings]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Netflix&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-documents-reveal-how-netflix-considers-a-show-successful-081058871.html">definition of a successful show</a> has been opaque at times, to put it mildly, but the company might have just provided some meaningful transparency. The streaming service has <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/new-top-10-on-netflix">launched</a> a &quot;Top 10 on Netflix&quot; <a href="https://top10.netflix.com/">website</a> that shows the charting movies and TV shows on the service, both English and non-English. You&#39;ll see both global and country-specific data to back up the rankings, including total viewing hours and the number of weeks on the chart.</p><p>You&#39;ll also find all-time stats and the list of countries where a given title is charting. Netflix even lets you download lists in Excel or TSV formats if you crave raw data.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The initial rankings don&#39;t provide too many surprises. The star-studded <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-08-netflix-red-notice-heist-movie.html"><em>Red Notice</em></a> was by far the most popular movie worldwide based on time spent, racking up 148.7 million viewing hours in its first week. <em>Yara</em> was the most-watched non-English title with nearly 18 million views. The latest season of <em>Narcos: Mexico</em> topped the English TV list with about 50.3 million hours after two weeks, and it won&#39;t shock you to hear <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-142-million-households-squid-game-070044407.html"><em>Squid Game</em></a> dominated non-English TV with 42.8 million million hours and nine weeks in the top 10.</p><p>Yes, Netflix was aware its viewing metric favors longer-running movies and shows. It planned to &quot;occasionally&quot; offer specialty charts to give popular productions in certain fields (such as documentaries) their due. However, the company said it wouldn&#39;t reveal how many people have finished a given movie or series — it believed all hours were relevant, whether you were distracted (think <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-28-netflix-and-chill-button.html">Netflix and chill</a>), rewatching a favorite show or fixating on an individual scene.</p><p>The site won&#39;t answer every question about Netflix&#39;s rankings. You may know which shows are getting the most viewing time, but you won&#39;t know just what it takes to get a renewal or sequel. Still, the potential effects are significant. Observers could better tell whether a title&#39;s viewership really matches the hype, or which countries are driving demand. And while studios are likely very aware of how their releases are faring, the site might push some to &#39;optimize&#39; their lineups to ensure consistently high rankings.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-top-10-chart-transparency-213412386.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">32152702-b447-4a2f-a861-935bb6e3a56e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 21:34:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637098455</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T21:36:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/66955890-471d-11ec-b373-cf340df96139" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/66955890-471d-11ec-b373-cf340df96139" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Netflix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Netflix Top 10 website]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Netflix Top 10 website]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard workers walk out and demand CEO Bobby Kotick's resignation]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Employees at Activision Blizzard are calling for the resignation of CEO Bobby Kotick following new revelations into the role he may have played in creating the toxic workplace culture that has mired the company in controversy.

One month after her <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-leader-j-allen-brack-steps-down-133538233.html"><ins>appointment</ins></a>, Blizzard&#39;s first female leader reportedly sent an email to the company&#39;s legal team in which she said she wasn&#39;t convinced Activision Blizzard would turn its culture around. Referencing a moment earlier in her career at the company, she says in the email, &quot;I have been tokenized, marginalized, and discriminated against.&quot;</p><p>Elsewhere, the report describes an episode involving Dan Bunting, one of the heads of Activision&#39;s Treyarch studio. In 2017, Bunting was reportedly accused of sexually harassing a female employee. Following an internal investigation, Activision&#39;s HR department recommended he be fired, but Kotick reportedly intervened to keep him at the company.</p><p>A spokesperson for Activision Blizzard disputed <em>The </em>Journal&#39;s reporting. The company&#39;s full statement reads as follows:</p><blockquote><p>We are disappointed in the Wall Street Journal’s report, which presents a misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our CEO. Instances of sexual misconduct that were brought to his attention were acted upon. The WSJ ignores important changes underway to make this the industry’s most welcoming and inclusive workplace and it fails to account for the efforts of thousands of employees who work hard every day to live up to their — and our — values. The constant desire to be better has always set this company apart. Which is why, at Mr. Kotick’s direction, we have made significant improvements, including a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate conduct. And it is why we are moving forward with unwavering focus, speed, and resources to continue increasing diversity across our company and industry and to ensure that every employee comes to work feeling valued, safe, respected, and inspired. We will not stop until we have the best workplace for our team.</p></blockquote><p>The company also commented on the impending walkout. &quot;We are fully committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and rewarding environment for all of our employees around the world. We support their right to express their opinions and concerns in a safe and respectful manner, without fear of retaliation,&quot; a spokesperson for Activision Blizzard told Engadget.</p><p>Amid the unrest at Activision Blizzard, Kotick has presented himself as an ally of the studio&#39;s employees. &quot;Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone-deaf,&quot; he said in an<a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-letter-172540779.html"><ins> email</ins></a> he sent after the Townsend message. In that same message, he claimed he would take &quot;swift action&quot; to create a safe and inclusive working environment. When Kotick later announced the company&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-151427460.html"><ins>zero-tolerance harassment policy</ins></a>, he said he would take a massive pay cut until Activision Blizzard&#39;s board of directors felt he had met the diversity and safety goals he outlined.</p><p>Even after today&#39;s report, it&#39;s hard to see Kotick resigning. He has been with Activision since the early 1990s, and he was the architect of the 2008 merger that created Activision Blizzard. The company&#39;s <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211116006294/en/Activision-Blizzard-Board-of-Directors-Issues-Statement-Regarding-Recent-Article">board of directors</a> has also said it &quot;remains confident&quot; in his leadership.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47dfec06-3247-47fa-9264-724fccf51e4d</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 19:49:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637092494</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T19:55:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cf8ce90-eb25-11eb-b7be-6e9a35131b68" width="3349" height="2233" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7cf8ce90-eb25-11eb-b7be-6e9a35131b68" width="3349" height="2233" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brendan McDermid / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bobby Kotick, chief executive officer of Activision Blizzard, attends the annual Allen and Co.

Then, in October, it expanded their availability to approximately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-expands-badges-and-commercials-130020878.html">50,000 creators</a>. Badges represent a way for Instagram creators to earn money from their fans. Users can purchase them to make themselves during livestreams. Instagram sells them in increments of $1, $2 and $5.</p><p>The company recently said it wouldn’t collect any fees on Badges until at least 2023. Down the line, the feature could help Instagram diversify its revenue beyond the advertising sales it depends on almost exclusively at the moment. More broadly, Badges could be the prelude to more perk-like monetization features making their way to the app in the future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-badges-us-rollout-180045149.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ed93d3b0-537c-4bb6-a589-76326ec0d7aa</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 18:00:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636998265</ingested><modified>2021-11-15T17:44:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b9e4ec70-4274-11ec-bacc-c762b6cb64d7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b9e4ec70-4274-11ec-bacc-c762b6cb64d7" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram Badges]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram Badges]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The latest version of NVIDIA's DLSS technology is better at rendering moving objects]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NVIDIA has released a major update for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-virtual-reality-games-no-mans-sky-154453795.html"><ins>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS)</ins></a> technology. With <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-image-scaler-dlss-rtx-november-2021-updates/"><ins>version 2.3</ins></a> of the software, the company says the AI algorithm makes smarter use of motion vectors to improve how objects look when they’re moving. The update also helps to reduce ghosting, make particle effects look clearer and improve temporal stability. The latter has traditionally been one of the weakest aspects of the technology, so DLSS 2.3 represents a major improvement. As of today, 16 games feature support for DLSS 2.3. Highlights include <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Deathloop</em> and <em>Doom Eternal</em>.</p><div id="9d71c95fcc874bffa8d75c07932f1b26"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBjL0M25t04?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>If you don’t own an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3080-review-ray-tracing-130054340.html"><ins>RTX GPU</ins></a> but still want to take advantage of the performance boost you can get from upscaling a game, NVIDIA has updated its Image Scaling technology to improve both fidelity and performance. Accessible through the NVIDIA Control Panel, the tool uses spatial upscaling to do the job. That means the result isn’t as clean as the temporal method DLSS uses, but the advantage is you don’t need special hardware. To that end, NVIDIA is releasing an SDK that will allow any GPU, regardless of make, to take advantage of the technology. In that way, NVIDIA says game developers can offer the best of both worlds: DLSS for the best possible image quality and NVIDIA Image Scaling for cross-platform support.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-dlss-2-3-update-180000345.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5b7b5099-107f-4891-942a-b4bc42863c41</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637085603</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T18:00:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2cea9630-4706-11ec-a95d-eb584318071c" width="3697" height="1850" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2cea9630-4706-11ec-a95d-eb584318071c" width="3697" height="1850" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA DLSS]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA DLSS]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['League of Legends' spin-off 'Ruined King' suddenly arrives on consoles and PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/riot%20forge/"><ins>Riot Forge</ins></a> said it would soon provide more long-awaited details about <em>League of Legends</em> spin-off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ruined-king-league-legends-130055934.html"><em><ins>Ruined King</ins></em></a><em>,</em> few fans would have expected Riot Games&#39; publishing arm to suddenly thrust the game into the world.

DTS supports 5.1-channel audio, but not a 7.1-channel setup or overhead speakers.

Sonos claims that, when the speakers are completely off, Move can retain battery life for up to 30 days and Roam can do so for as long as 70 days.</p><p>Elsewhere, the Now Playing screen on the iOS app will have EQ settings.

Real-time viewer engagement via chat and alerts create incredible shared experiences,&quot; Ashray Urs, Streamlabs&#39; head of product, said in a statement. &quot;In the past, creating professional broadcasts and engaging viewers from a console has been challenging.

The headline feature is a carousel that shows local news in response to search queries, launching around the world in all languages starting today. Google initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-21-google-coronavirus-search-hub.html">launched</a> the feature to provide local information for COVID searches, but it&#39;s now been expanded to other topics like sports, local government and more.</p><p>Google said it&#39;s been tweaking its systems so that authoritative, relevant local news sources appear more often next to national publications in Top Stories and other general news features. &quot;This improvement ensures people will see authoritative local stories when they’re searching for news, helping both the brand and the content of news publishers reach more people,&quot; Google said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s also able to drill down into narrow subtopics related to local news, like high school football. Combined with its location services (provided you have those enabled), you should get more relevant results. &quot;For example, if you’re in Detroit and search for football, we’ll now show you results for local high school and college teams, rather than just showing you results for, say, the professional team,&quot; Google said. It will also surface tweets from news organization along with &quot;authoritative sources and authors.&quot;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3ad6e3f0-46d6-11ec-b7b0-b4f76d9be602" alt="Google launches new features to support local news organizations" data-uuid="14b195a2-c8e6-30f8-af3c-158ee9f837b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Alongside the new consumer features, Google announced new data tools for reporters. First up is the Census Mapper project, a map that can be embedded in stories to display Census data at the national, state and county level. It was produced as part of the 2020 Census Co-op, supported the Google News Initiative. It can show Census data at a local level, showing how populations have shifted over time. Google is also improving its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-journalist-studio-pinpoint-110047367.html">Common Knowledge Project</a>, a visual journalism project that allows reporters to explore local data.&nbsp;</p><p>The new features might be cold comfort to the many local newspapers and websites that have been <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-05-24/local-newspapers-dying-ways-to-save-them">gone out of business</a> in part due to the flow of ad dollars to companies like Facebook and Google. Both of those tech giants have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-15-facebook-invest-local-newsrooms.html">put in some funds</a> to support local journalism, but that has done little to stop the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/21/reader-center/local-news-deserts.html">decline</a> of newspapers that perform a valuable service in their communities.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-launches-new-features-to-support-local-news-organizations-152504647.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d661acc5-7767-4637-ae43-441078dadf49</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 15:25:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637075717</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T15:15:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b48a2e0-46da-11ec-bce5-f80a6ed0fd8d" width="4676" height="3118" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6b48a2e0-46da-11ec-bce5-f80a6ed0fd8d" width="4676" height="3118" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shannon Stapleton / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A sign is seen at the entrance to the Google retail store in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York City, U.S., June 17, 2021.

A <a href="https://png.sainsburys.co.uk/">website</a> for the upcoming SmartShop Pick &amp; Go store only mentioned the technology coming from a &quot;third-party supplier,&quot; but <em>Bloomberg</em> sources said Amazon was responsible.</p><p>Amazon declined to comment. A Sainsbury&#39;s spokesperson wouldn&#39;t confirm or deny Amazon&#39;s involvement, but did say it was testing an &quot;upgraded version&quot; of SmartShop with employees in a Holborn store. The shop is believed to be opening to the public on November 29th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The hardware certainly appears to be Amazon&#39;s, if <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s visit to the store was any indication. Customers scan their phones on the way in, and ceiling-mounted cameras use AI to detect what they take from shelves. You&#39;re charged as soon as you leave the store.</p><p>Sainsbury&#39;s has a few incentives to adopt Just Walk Out. While the UK has relaxed many of its pandemic measures, this could be appealing to customers who still want to avoid contact with staff and often-touched self-checkout kiosks. The faster turnarounds could lead to more customers even without safety concerns. And then there&#39;s competition — Tesco recently opened a nearby Express store using rival technology from Trigo Vision.

Food Scan is the latest addition to the app’s “scan” functionality, which also allows users to identify plants and dog breeds and items of clothing.</p><p>Now, scanning a food will turn up recipes containing the item, as well as a link to the Wikipedia entry for the ingredient. Snap has partnered with allrecipes.com on the feature, which it says can recognize more than 1,200 items and suggest more than 4,500 dishes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I got the chance to preview the feature, and the app’s food scanning abilities were mostly spot-on. It was able to correctly identify a variety of produce and recommend relevant recipes (including a persimmon bar recipe that looked intriguing). Like most of these types of visual search features, though, it’s not entirely foolproof. It suggested cherry recipes when I scanned a bag of cherry tomatoes. And a hunk of ginger managed to totally stump the feature. No matter what angle I held the camera, Snapchat was unable to recognize it as food, and instead recommended reptile and human hand-themed AR lenses.</p><p>The feature is also not meant to work with packaged foods — Snapchat has a separate feature that can scan those items for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-scan-food-and-wine-labels-130019011.html"><ins>nutritional info</ins></a> — so it won’t be able to help you figure out what to do with that random can of tomato sauce or whatever else is collecting dust in the back of your pantry. But even with those limitations, the feature is still a useful starting point for when you’re out of ideas or just want to try something new. And, even when it doesn’t quite work, you might still find an entertaining new AR lens to try out.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchats-camera-can-scan-food-to-recommend-recipes-150040166.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">17f49f18-3fde-4824-bdd2-2814cb830970</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 15:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637028049</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T02:00:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5f2dd250-4671-11ec-bf7e-a037c647f971" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5f2dd250-4671-11ec-bf7e-a037c647f971" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Snap]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Snapchat's camera can scan food for recipe inspo.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[snapchat food scan]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[PlayStation Remote Play now supports PS5 DualSense controllers on Android 12]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/sony/"><ins>Sony</ins></a> has updated the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playstation.remoteplay&amp;hl"><ins>PS Remote Play app</ins></a> on Android, which now has some extra controller features for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%2012/"><ins>Android 12</ins></a> users.

Thankfully, there&#39;s a somewhat more accessible option. The instrument brand has <a href="https://www.fender.com/acoustasonic/player/en">unveiled</a> an Acoustic Player Telecaster with both a more affordable <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,200 price" href="https://fave.co/3osZV9k">$1,200 price</a> and a simpler design with a three-way voice selector (versus five on other models) and one blend knob. In theory, this is better-suited to younger, newer musicians who want two guitars in one — at least, if they can justify spending over a grand on new hardware.</p><p>The Fishman co-designed pickup helps you switch between acoustic and electric modes, and the N4 pickup promises &quot;noiseless&quot; electric playing. You&#39;ll find a total of six voicings you can play either by themselves or merged to create fresh sounds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Acoustasonic Player Telecaster is available worldwide in four familiar guitar colors (black, white, butterscotch and a graded &quot;Shadow Burst&quot;). There&#39;s still an incentive to splurge on the more expensive guitars if you want more control, but this might make sense if you need that $800 or just want something that saves space and time. This might be the ideal guitar if you need to play electric on stage, but acoustic in your apartment.</p><div id="2bcf24668fb94cf6af2f625cb33edf42"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j5nAngwKsus?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fender-acoustasonic-player-telecaster-guitar-140315674.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">060fe199-dc73-4ba8-bdbf-0c7f827aae3f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 14:03:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637072730</ingested><modified>2021-11-16T14:25:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Musical Instruments]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/fd065390-46e8-11ec-bf7a-85322da96f5e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/fd065390-46e8-11ec-bf7a-85322da96f5e" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fender]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fender Acoustic Player Telecaster hybrid guitar]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fender Acoustic Player Telecaster hybrid guitar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Firefox Relay offers unlimited email aliases as part of its new premium plan]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-rally-data-platform-130034616.html">Mozilla</a> launched <a href="https://relay.firefox.com/">Firefox Relay</a> as a free product that gives you five email aliases you can use every time you need to sign up for a random account online.

If you use Firefox and install the Relay extension, though, a Relay icon will appear on the entry field every time you visit a website that asks for an email address. You can simply click it to generate an alias. The service will forward messages you get using your aliases to your primary email account, and you can block all messages from coming in or even delete the alias when it starts getting spam.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In its announcement, Mozilla said it decided to introduce the paid option because lot of beta testers wanted more than just five aliases.
