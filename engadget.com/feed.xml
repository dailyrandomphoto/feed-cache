Now, streamers and their trusted helper will be able to <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/our-continued-fight-against-hate-and-harassment">temporarily mute people for minutes</a>, hours or the length of an entire livestream. According to Eric Han, head of Tiktok&#39;s US Safety team, muting a person will remove their entire comment history from the stream. And of course, you could also just turn off comments entirely or filter out specific keywords. Together with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-live-stream-kindness-discovery-tools-133912505.html">Tiktok&#39;s last batch of &quot;kindness&quot; updates </a>for livestreamers, the platform is aiming to create a safer environment for creators.</p><p>Han says the prompts TikTok added in July ‚Äî which pop up to make you think twice about posting an &quot;unkind or harmful&quot; comment ‚Äî have led almost 40 percent of people editing or withdrawing their comment entirely.

Based on its Q2 <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/tiktok-transparency-report-2021-q-2?lang=en">Community Guidelines Enforcement Report</a>, the company says it&#39;s also getting better at weeding out improper videos. Han says 73.3 percent of harassment videos were removed before there were any user reports, whereas that figure was 66.2 percent in the previous quarter. Similarly, 72.9 percent of videos showing hateful behavior were removed in the second quarter, compared to 67.3 percent previously.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-livestream-mute-temporary-harassment-184929315.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf7fb092-eeb9-4f03-bb59-4c505749554d</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 18:49:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634150384</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T18:39:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-02/2f6fe710-4ddf-11ea-b3ff-ca9d067be64b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-02/2f6fe710-4ddf-11ea-b3ff-ca9d067be64b" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anatoliy Sizov via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tyumen, Russia - January 21, 2020: TikTok and Facebook application  on screen Apple iPhone XR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TikTok and Facebook application  on screen Apple iPhone XR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A live-action 'System Shock' TV series is on the way]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nightdive Studios‚Äô immersive sim franchise <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/system%20shock"><ins>System Shock</ins></a> franchise is being turned into a live-action TV show.

The goal was to find ‚Äúreference‚Äù or ‚Äúbenchmark‚Äù wares and copy them. A document from 2016 detailed a plan for an Amazon brand called Solimo, which is tailored toward the Indian market. The aim was to ‚Äúuse information from Amazon.in to develop products and then leverage the Amazon.in platform to market these products to our customers.‚Äù</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The document indicated that the private brands group aimed to form partnerships with the manufacturers of the benchmark items, because those companies use ‚Äúunique processes which impact the end quality of the product.‚Äù The team sought to gain insights from the manufacturers and use the so-called &quot;Tribal Knowledge&quot; in its own versions to &quot;fully match quality with our reference product.&quot;</p><p>After it made the knockoffs, the company manipulated search results with a method called ‚Äúsearch seeding‚Äù so that AmazonBasics and Solimo items would pop up near the top of the page, according to the document. The company also &quot;aggressively&quot; used a technique called ‚Äúsearch sparkles on PC, Mobile and App to specifically promote Solimo products on relevant customer searches from ‚ÄòAll Product Search‚Äô and Category search,‚Äù per the document.

The first strike of Amazon workers organized by the CGIL, Cisl and Uil unions at the Arzano headquarters was totally deserted by the workers who did not join the presidium to which, in addition to the unions, some formations of the extra-parliamentary left joined. The unions had called the strike day to ask for a review of many aspects of staff contracts: workloads, shifts, meal vouchers, bonuses, travel allowances and reduced working hours, and a general stabilization of drivers, the logistics sector and the administered employees. For some trade unionists, the absence of workers from the garrison should be read as "fear that their contracts will not be renewed".

In a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/advancing-online-bullying-harassment-policies/">post</a> attributed to Head of Safety Antigone Davis, the company said it will take down mass coordinated harassment campaigns targeted at individuals at heightened risk of offline harm. It will do so even if the content people post wouldn‚Äôt normally violate its safety guidelines. Additionally, Facebook says it will remove objectionable content in whatever form it takes, be that direct messages, comments or posts. As part of the same policy, the company will remove state-linked networks that work together to silence and harass people.</p><p>Had the above policy been in place in the past, one situation where Facebook may have enforced it was when Taylor Swift‚Äôs Instagram account was bombarded with snake emoji following a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7934297/taylor-swift-the-snake-history-kim-kanye-instagram">dramatic breakup with electronic producer Calvin Harris</a>. Speaking of celebrities, the company has also put in place new protections to safeguard public figures from sexual harassment and appearance shaming. To that end, it plans to remove profiles, pages and groups dedicated to sexualizing those individuals. It will also target ‚Äúsevere sexualizing content,‚Äù including photoshopped images and drawings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>‚ÄúWe made these changes because attacks like these can weaponize a public figure‚Äôs appearance, which is unnecessary and often not related to the work these public figures represent,‚Äù the company said.

Those may include individuals like journalists and human rights activists.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook has repeatedly faced pressure to do more to prevent bullying and harassment across all of its apps, but particularly on Instagram. In the aftermath of the Euro 2020 final, which saw <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/football/england-racist-abuse-bukayo-saka-jadon-sancho-marcus-rashford-euro-2020-final-spt-intl/index.html">three Black players</a> on the English national team face a flood of harassment after England lost to Italy, Instagram Head Adam Mosseri promised the company would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-limits-feature-test-223844994.html">introduce new feature</a>s to protect users. ‚ÄúRacism and hate speech have no place on Instagram,‚Äù he said at the time. ‚ÄúIt is not only honestly fucked up to see people treated that way, but it breaks how Instagram works.‚Äù</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-targeted-harassment-policy-172858497.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10775835-5fcc-4413-9e16-a618775a6c8b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:28:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634146144</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T17:29:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2c111270-26c2-11ec-afe7-9bdea293e11a" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2c111270-26c2-11ec-afe7-9bdea293e11a" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chesnot via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[PARIS, FRANCE - OCTOBER 06: In this photo illustration, the Facebook logo is displayed on the screen of an iPhone on October 06, 2021 in Paris, France.

The first stage is a series of server-side enhancements that will better identify and remove cheaters from games, and this is scheduled to hit <em>Warzone</em> with the Pacific update later this year. These new server tools will be live in <em>Vanguard </em>when it comes out on November 5th.</p><p>The second prong is a PC kernel-level driver designed to monitor the deepest level of every player&#39;s rig while they&#39;re in-game, in an effort to stop outside software from sneaking in through this back door. The kernel, or ring 0, is the most privileged level of any PC, granting access to every layer of hardware, and generally reserved for things like graphics card drivers and trusted bits of the operating system.

(Confusingly, the <em>Valorant</em> anti-cheat system is called Vanguard).</p><div id="c7840546fbe84c279e58bf5f1b31e757"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4W_1zA6j9FU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>This isn&#39;t a new worry, either ‚Äî in 2013, the always-on ring 0 anti-cheat system employed by <a href="https://play.esea.net/news/12692">ESEA</a> was commandeered to turn unsuspecting players&#39; PCs into a secret bitcoin mining farm.</p><p>With these lessons in mind, Activision has stressed that RICOCHET will only be active when the associated game is live, saying specifically, &quot;the driver shuts down when you exit the game and turns on when you start a new game.&quot;</p><p>The kernel-level driver will hit <em>Warzone</em> alongside the Pacific update this year, and it&#39;ll come to <em>Vanguard</em> at a later date.</p><p>Cheating has been a significant problem in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/call-of-duty-warzone-bans-60000-confirmed-cheaters-071107304.html">for a long while now</a>. Activision has banned more than 500,000 accounts since the game&#39;s launch, though it&#39;s not uncommon for matches to be riddled with aimbots and cheap hacks to this day. Players have been screaming for a robust anti-cheat system in <em>Warzone</em> and other Call of Duty titles, and RICOCHET is Activision&#39;s kernel-level, not-always-on answer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/call-duty-warzone-vanguard-anti-cheat-ricochet-kernel-driver-170043541.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">86578928-da61-49ae-82ca-1e10204557d4</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 17:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634144204</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T16:56:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/07fa1c00-2c45-11ec-a8d7-6b86cb0c143c" width="1920" height="1193" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/07fa1c00-2c45-11ec-a8d7-6b86cb0c143c" width="1920" height="1193" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Activision]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Call of Duty Warzone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Call of Duty Warzone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DoorDash establishes $1M relief fund for restaurants hit by natural disasters]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over the next year, DoorDash has earmarked <a href="https://ir.doordash.com/news/news-details/2021/DoorDash-Establishes-1000000-Restaurant-Disaster-Relief-Fund/default.aspx"><ins>$1,000,000</ins></a> to support local restaurants affected by state or federally declared natural disasters.

The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:SoundLink Flex" href="https://fave.co/3iZbqmR">SoundLink Flex</a> has an IP67 rating, meaning it&#39;s water, dust and dirt resistant, and the company even claims that the speaker will float to the surface if you drop it in water (but you should probably fish it out quickly if it drops into a bathtub or the ocean).</p><p>The silicone rear and powder-coated steel grille should protect the speaker from drops and bumps, according to Bose. The company also claims the device is resistant to UV light and corrosion and it won&#39;t peel or flake.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But it&#39;s not just the speaker&#39;s apparent toughness that makes it interesting. Bose says it packed the SoundLink Flex with features &quot;to deliver astonishing audio performance.&quot; It claims that the custom transducer provides maximum audio clarity and &quot;bass that you can feel in your chest.‚Äù The SoundLink Flex also has dual-opposing passive radiators, as well as Bose&#39;s digital signal processing tech, which should minimize distortion.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/67d190d0-2c3c-11ec-bde7-c031a012c437" alt="A Bose SoundLink Flex portable Bluetooth speaker in some mud." data-uuid="cb2ba729-b153-3e91-a5de-b30f13eca84d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Bose</div></figure><p>The speaker can detect its orientation and adjust the audio output accordingly. So, whether it&#39;s horizontal, vertical or hanging from the utility loop, the sound will be optimized. It&#39;s the company&#39;s first Bluetooth speaker that uses this Bose PositionIQ tech.</p><p>SoundLink Flex can remember up to eight Bluetooth connections to make it easy to switch from one device to another. You can adjust the settings using the Bose Connect app and control your phone&#39;s voice assistant and take calls using the speaker&#39;s microphone.</p><p>You can pair a second Bose Bluetooth speaker for stereo or simultaneous playback. The SoundLink Flex can connect to other Bose speakers and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-smart-soundbar-900-dolby-atmos-spatial-audio-144433233.html">soundbars</a> as part of a home audio system. Bose says you&#39;ll get up to 12 hours of playback on a single charge and you can recharge the lithium-ion battery with a USB-C cable.</p><p>The SoundLink Flex is just under eight inches wide, 2.1 inches deep and 3.6 inches tall. It weighs just over a pound and is available in black, white smoke or stone blue. The speaker costs <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$149" href="https://fave.co/3iZbqmR">$149</a> and you can pick it up from Bose&#39;s website starting today.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundlink-flex-portable-bluetooth-speaker-rugged-160442384.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f795460-119b-4595-bb0e-1865f716ea24</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 16:04:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634149581</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T18:26:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Speakers & Headphones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/650b6bf0-2c3c-11ec-b6d1-5212858bfa79" width="1919" height="1391" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/650b6bf0-2c3c-11ec-b6d1-5212858bfa79" width="1919" height="1391" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bose]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person holding a Bose SoundLink Flex portable Bluetooth speaker that has water on it.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bose SoundLink Flex portable Bluetooth speaker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Anker's audio glasses pair swappable frames with 'surround' sound for $200]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Anker is jumping into the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jlab-audio-jbuds-frames-true-wireless-open-ear-speakers-eyewear-152928580.html">increasingly crowded</a> world of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-04-bose-frames-audio-ar-sunglasses-available-january.html">audio eyewear</a>.

The website has been testing the feature for a year, and now that it&#39;s widely available, community mods and mod-approved users will be able to create Predictions Tournaments with a series of questions that challenges you to predict the outcome of an event or conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;ll get 1,000 tokens for free when you join a tournament, which can consist of as many questions as a moderator wants ‚Äî they can add more even after the tournament has started. When you vote for the prediction you want, you&#39;ll have to bet some of the tokens you get after you joined. How to distribute those tokens is totally up to you, and you will win more on top of the ones you used for every correct prediction. The larger the number of tokens you put in, the more you can win. However, you&#39;ll have to make your tokens last throughout the tournament, and there&#39;s no way to get more if it turns out that your prediction game is weak. It&#39;s a totally user-driven experience, since the tournament&#39;s creator will also be in charge of resolving the outcome and making sure you get your winnings.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So, what do you get for correct predictions aside from winning tokens? Mostly, recognition in the form of a leaderboard. Tokens are only for use in the Prediction experience, so you can&#39;t really do anything with them on the website. Reddit will start rolling out the feature today, and it will be available for all communities with at least 10,000 members.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4f01d7b0-2c1c-11ec-bef2-80c96a2637bc" style="height:647;width:669;" alt="Reddit" data-uuid="e5336946-1b23-3e31-b9a7-7f8237c988a9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Reddit</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/reddit-predictions-150040687.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0b16da11-17c8-4cf1-a92b-d4020805bf7c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 15:00:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634126677</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T12:04:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/95f87310-06a9-11ec-bf66-80c6a3820096" width="3301" height="2156" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/95f87310-06a9-11ec-bf66-80c6a3820096" width="3301" height="2156" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Reddit app is seen on a smartphone in this illustration taken, July 13, 2021.

Designed for the company&#39;s full-frame <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7s-iii-mirrorless-camera-review-140041536.html">Alpha-series</a> mirrorless cameras, it&#39;s the lightest 70-200mm F2.8 lens on the market at 1,045 grams, Sony said. It also offers a number of features aimed at movie creators not usually seen in a lens like this.&nbsp;</p><p>While large zoom lenses tend to focus slowly, Sony said the new model uses four XD linear motors to deliver reliable focus that&#39;s up to three times faster than rival models, and four times faster than the previous model on Sony&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">Alpha 1 camera</a>. Tracking with continuous autofocus while zooming has improved by 30 percent compared first-gen model, too. It also focuses quietly, so the motor sound is less likely to be picked up by a camera&#39;s microphone.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="d9198c7feeb44655a87fc5859b5bda13"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hsZnBaumeF0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Video shooters often need to pull focus between subjects, but lenses designed for photography usually exhibit &quot;breathing,&quot; or zooming in and out while changing focus. Sony said it designed the FE 70-200 F2.8 GM OSS II to curtail that, while also reducing focus shift while zooming. Such features are usually only found in cinema lenses that cost considerably more.</p><p>The lens should deliver nice bokeh thanks to the wide, continuous F2.8 aperture, while offering good handling with dual lens elements that move internally. It also offers three separate rings for focus, aperture and zoom, making it easier to rig for cinema use. Other features include high resolution, extra-low dispersion, aspherical glass to suppress chromatic aberrations, Sony&#39;s Nano AR Coating II to reduce flares and ghosting and a new 11-blade aperture that produces softer, more circular bokeh.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony also offers <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1222777-REG/sony_sel14tc_fe_1_4x_teleconverter.html?sts=pi&amp;pim=Y">FE 1.4x</a> and <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1222778-REG/sony_sel20tc_fe_2x_teleconverter.html?sts=pi&amp;pim=Y">FE 2.0x</a> teleconverters ($548 for each) that extend the lens&#39;s focal length up to 400mm at F5.6. The FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS II zoom lens will go on sale in December for $2,800, or $3,500 CAD in Canada.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonys-lightweight-70-200-mm-zoom-has-features-designed-for-video-creators-140542959.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0af587ce-efd6-40be-b5b8-6e59aa843daf</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 14:05:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634136489</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T14:48:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b73ec7c0-2c30-11ec-bfff-7f9439160618" width="2000" height="1275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b73ec7c0-2c30-11ec-bfff-7f9439160618" width="2000" height="1275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony's lightweight 70-200mm zoom has features designed for video creators]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony's lightweight 70-200mm zoom has features designed for video creators]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acer's new Chromebook Spin 514 features a fanless design and improved webcam]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its usual autumn laptop refresh, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Acer" href="https://fave.co/2YInpi1">Acer</a> is announcing a host of new Chromebook today that&#39;ll roll out in the coming months. There are four models being refreshed today: the Chromebook Spin 514, Chromebook 515, Chromebook 514, and Chromebook Spin 314. That&#39;s a lot of product names, but Spin devices can flip around with a 360-degree hinge, and the last two digits denote the screen size. That should hopefully ground you as we go through these new models.</p><p>Most interesting is probably the Spin 514 (pictured above), which combines a 14-inch 1080p touchscreen that has minimal bezels with Intel&#39;s 11th-generation Core i3, i5 or i7 processors. This laptop has no fans, which means these probably aren&#39;t the highest-powered versions of Intel&#39;s chips, but they should still provide solid performance for Chrome OS. Acer also put some focus on the webcam, a wise choice given how we&#39;re all still stuck on videos calls for the foreseeable future. It&#39;s a 1080p camera with a blue glass filter and new noise-reduction technology to remove things like light flares. We&#39;ll have to see how this works in practice, but given how many laptops have entirely mediocre webcams, any improvements here will be welcome.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="2ed702dc-e239-43be-a58c-8a43c95d2c4a"/><p>Other specs include up to 16GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, Intel Iris X graphics and 10 hours of battery life. The Spin 514 weighs in at 3 pounds, so it&#39;s not going to be the lightest thing to use in tablet mode, but otherwise it sounds like it&#39;ll be a very good Chromebook ‚Äî it also simply looks nice and well-built, at least as far as I can tell from these images. And Acer has a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html">solid track record</a> of making very good Chromebooks, so hopefully that&#39;ll continue here. The Spin 514 is expected to arrive in the US in January and starts at $700.</p><p>Acer&#39;s Chromebook 515 (which comes in consumer and enterprise editions) has similar specs to the Spin 514, though it has a larger 15.6-inch display. Given the large size, this laptop isn&#39;t a convertible, which is probably a smart move. For a 15-inch laptop, though, it&#39;s pretty light ‚Äî only 3.75 pounds. It comes with the same 11th-generation processor options as the Spin 514, though it also has a budget Pentium Gold option (paired with Intel&#39;s UHD graphics rather than the Iris X). The Chromebook 515 will initially be available in Europe this month for ‚Ç¨499; the Enterprise version will come to the US in January 2022 starting at $640.</p><p>Acer has a few less expensive Chromebooks coming out, as well. The Chromebook Spin 314 starts at $500 and arrives in the US in November. For that price, you&#39;ll get a 14-inch screen with an unfortunate 1,366 x 768 resolution, which is pretty unacceptable in the year 2021. It also features budget processors in the form of Intel&#39;s Pentium Gold or two Celeron options and has a 360-degree hinge, as the name implies. More intriguing is the Chromebook 514, which pairs a 14-inch, 1080p display with MediaTek&#39;s 8-core Kompanio 828 processor and 8GB of RAM. We haven&#39;t tested a MediaTek Chromebook in a while, so we can&#39;t say for sure how it&#39;ll perform yet. But Acer is promising 15 hours of battery life, and the laptop weighs less than 3 pounds, so it does have some potential as a budget Chromebook (the 514 will cost $400 when it is released in December).&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-514-fall-2021-updates-134548903.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d54e340a-68fb-48c3-b5fd-075c26a8617c</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:45:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634134207</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T14:10:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eb40bab0-2c26-11ec-aff8-1394753ed502" width="3000" height="2377" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/eb40bab0-2c26-11ec-aff8-1394753ed502" width="3000" height="2377" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Acer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 514 (2021)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer Chromebook Spin 514 (2021)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Acer's glasses-free 3D SpatialLabs laptop arrives this winter]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-conceptd-7-7-pro-laptop-update-300-mid-tower-134558886.html">usual</a> raft of hardware updates, Acer is adding new ConceptD machines with new displays and different chassis options.

The idea is to enable 3D artists to preview their work in a form closer to the finished article long before it had reached the lengthy rendering pipeline. But while that initial concept was only available to developers who applied (and promised to share their work with Acer), this is a retail product.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs Edition is packing an 11th-generation Core i7, with the option of a GeForce RTX 3080, up to 64GB RAM and up to a 2TB SSD. And users are going to be staring into a Pantone-validated 4K display with a Delta E&lt;2 color accuracy for those who need it. Of course, this is only a sideshow to the eye-tracking cameras sited on the top bezel to match the 3D images to your gaze.</p><p>Acer added that, on the software side, it has updated the AI underpinning the system that enables users to view 3D content from any 2D image (or video) shown on screen. The company has also launched a new developer site to allow users to download all of the various plugins and tools (including a hand-tracking app and add-ons for Unreal Engine) to make everything work.</p><p>Of course, it‚Äôs not simply designers who may find the D 7 (don‚Äôt make me type it all out again) a useful proposition. The company says that it already has examples of companies using this as a car configurator for showroom use, architects using this to show off home designs and researchers examining high-resolution images from satellites.</p><p>If you want one of these, bear in mind that you‚Äôll need to wait until December (if you‚Äôre in EMEA) or 2022 (if you‚Äôre in the US). Plus, you know, it‚Äôs going to cost: The starting price on that side of the pond will be ‚Ç¨3,599 (roughly $4,158).</p><p>At the same time, the company is launching a new 16-inch ConceptD 3 model with a 16:10-ratio display and a 15.6-inch convertible edition. These, too, will be reaching the US at some point early next year, with base prices running from $1,700 through to $2,000, depending on your size preferences.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/acer-fall-2021-conceptd-7-spatiallabs-edition-134507031.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">082eb81b-ab5c-436f-bf0d-7548dabaae6d</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:45:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634134171</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T14:09:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbead7e0-2b51-11ec-ab7f-be692b31021c" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fbead7e0-2b51-11ec-ab7f-be692b31021c" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Acer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs edition]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Acer ConceptD 7 SpatialLabs edition]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple is reportedly exploring ways to use AirPods as health devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s health ambitions for AirPods might extend beyond using them to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-conversation-boost-feature-175701382.html">boost conversations</a>. <em>Wall Street Journal</em><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-studying-potential-of-airpods-as-health-device-11634122800?mod=djemalertNEWS">sources</a> claim Apple is exploring multiple ways it can use AirPods as health devices. It might use the buds as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eargos-latest-smart-hearing-aids-bring-a-much-needed-hearing-test-160001810.html">hearing aids</a>, but it could also use the motion sensors to correct your posture. A prototype would even include a thermometer to check your core body temperature, according to leaked documents.</p><p>The features wouldn&#39;t show up in 2022 and might not be available at all, the sources said. Apple declined to comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple would face numerous hurdles to marketing AirPods as health gadgets. The company would likely require regulatory clearance for at least some features. A US Food and Drug Administration ruleset due in 2022 might make that possible, but it could still take months to approve the earbuds. Even Bose had to wait a long time before it could sell its FDA-cleared <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aids-152746656.html">SoundControl hearing aids</a>.</p><p>There are technical challenges, too. Right now, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a> won&#39;t last longer than 4.5 hours for listening (with noise cancelling on), and 3.5 hours for calls ‚Äî that just wouldn&#39;t be practical for health wearables that might need to sit in your ears all day. They&#39;d also need to be comfortable for long periods and adapt to varying types of hearing loss.</p><p>It&#39;s easy to see why Apple might expand the AirPods&#39; usefulness, though. As with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">the Apple Watch</a>, health could be a selling point that grow the audience beyond the enthusiast core. It might also court a relatively underserved market of people who may have mild or moderate hearing loss, but either can&#39;t afford most hearing aids or don&#39;t like the limited functionality and drab designs that often define the category.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-health-device-leak-132037664.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">066803f7-d9d7-4501-b5dd-e0b0ebdef386</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:20:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634131150</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T13:19:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/989a1f60-12da-11eb-a5ff-730eaab52657" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/989a1f60-12da-11eb-a5ff-730eaab52657" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro in ears]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Pro in ears]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 review: It‚Äôs all about the screen]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="aeb9b088196a4fa4b92deb78f14e315f"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3F54aFTMhLU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The main difference between Apple‚Äôs Watch Series 7 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">the Series 6</a> is just a larger display, but it makes an outsized impact on a device as small as a watch. Apple also generally enlarged the UI, making things easier to read and navigate. To make better use of the bigger canvas, the company also added some new watch faces and a full QWERTY keyboard for replying to messages.</p><p>The other changes to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:the Series 7" href="https://amzn.to/3iXCNxT">the Series 7</a> are less obvious, like a new SiP (system-in-package), faster charging and overnight respiratory tracking. For those coming from the last generation, this might not feel like a significant upgrade. But the larger display does make a meaningful impact for anyone that‚Äôs upgrading from a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-se-review-watchos-7-price-specs-comparison-172542713.html">Watch SE</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-24-apple-watch-series-5-review.html">Series 5</a> or older.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design and hardware</h2><p>Even though its screen is bigger, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-release-date-price-172920553.html">the Series 7</a> still manages to retain basically the same footprint as its predecessor. It‚Äôs a hair heavier than the Watch SE and Series 6, which makes sense since its case is slightly larger. Unlike previous generations, which came in 40 and 44mm sizes, this year you can choose between 41mm and 45mm. The difference is barely noticeable at first.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9761caa0-2b96-11ec-bffd-fddd7431d5dc" alt="An off-angle view of the Apple Watch Series 7 on a person&#39;s wrist, showing the screen&#39;s refracted edge and the watch&#39;s dial and button." data-uuid="bbaa17ff-6cb2-39cc-a85d-29dc0859f8b3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Once I turned the screen on, though, I was struck by its roominess. This was when this main design change became obvious. Apple used a refractive edge here to make it seem like the display curves slightly along the sides and it helps the face feel even more expansive. The bezels have been whittled down to just 1.7mm (0.07 inch) compared to last gen‚Äôs 3mm.</p><p>Oh, and a quick shout here to its durability: It‚Äôs the first Apple Watch to be certified IP6X for dust resistance. Since I‚Äôm in reviewer mode, I&#39;ve been very careful to avoid situations where I might damage the device. But I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve already dropped the Series 7 once and it survived without a scratch, thanks to Apple‚Äôs crystal covering that the company says is more crack resistant than on the Series 6.</p><p>Now, you‚Äôre probably not comparing an Apple Watch to Android or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">Wear OS</a>, but in case you were curious, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy Watch 4</a> is noticeably lighter than the Series 7. It also has a round face and thinner body. But really, if you‚Äôre an iPhone user, you‚Äôve probably never even thought about a Galaxy watch.</p><h2>A big screen difference</h2><p>Depending on which Apple Watch you‚Äôd been using before, the jump in screen size may be less obvious. It‚Äôs increased more than 50 percent from the SE and 20 percent from the Series 6. Either way, the more spacious UI is helpful. Buttons for entering my passcode stretched out over the edges, and I didn&#39;t need to aim as carefully to strike the right keys. It&#39;s easier to hit the right settings in the control center, too, and I can see more of my friends‚Äô messages at once. My heart rate and time passed during workouts are more readable as well. Those with visual impairments will also appreciate that there are new larger font size settings available.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed648510-2c26-11ec-9fdf-6858672c9558" style="height:1112;width:1639;" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" data-uuid="3230d43e-c6c7-3d6c-a561-ba7d52b65502"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Though most buttons are between 12 and 27 percent larger, app icons are still squished together. That‚Äôs a problem for those of us who use the grid view for all apps, but not so much if you‚Äôre in list view.</p><p>The extra space also means Apple was able to introduce a full QWERTY keyboard for replying to messages by typing or swiping on the screen. Compared to handwriting, dictating or emojis, a keyboard offers a bit more flexibility, especially when the system correctly picks up your swipes. But because it‚Äôs so cramped, the accuracy rate is <em>maybe</em> 60 percent, and I still preferred using dictation. Plus, the new screen may be big, but it‚Äôs definitely not big enough to make tap typing possible. Still, it‚Äôs a good option to have.</p><p>In addition to enlarging most of the elements across the UI, Apple also added new faces that can display more information at once, like the Modular Duo. There‚Äôs also a Contour style that pushes the clock‚Äôs digits all the way to the edge where they warp and ‚Äúmelt‚Äù over the sides like in Salvador Dali‚Äôs <em>The Persistence of Memory</em>. The remaining two are a Portrait face that we already saw in the watchOS 8 beta, and World Time, which is helpful for interacting with people in other countries. I used Modular Duo the most, though it‚Äôs not very attractive, and when I wanted something prettier I just switched to one with my face as the wallpaper instead. (Just kidding: I use the ‚ÄúArtist‚Äù design or a cute animal background.)</p><section data-eng-breakout="2b903d05d74b4e6b8d04e467648d0717" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed648510-2c26-11ec-af5f-1b44504099ed" alt="Apple Watch Series 7" data-uuid="9a8809c7-0765-3935-a87b-005d625b5f40"></section><p>The new Modular Duo screen is the most useful. It lets you place two expanded complications on top of each other, while still showing the time and an additional small complication at the top. You can choose to show the world clock with a timer or your favorite stock‚Äôs performance with Apple Music, for example. I went with a Spotify controller and the Weather forecast. Though the latter worked well, showing me hourly temperature and sunlight data on the screen, the Spotify complication was, in a word, trash. It just shows the words ‚ÄúTap to play music,‚Äù and I‚Äôd have to waste a tap and a second to pull up playback controls.</p><p>A second doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but when I‚Äôm out running or juggling my groceries, I don‚Äôt want to waste that time holding up my arm and watching my screen for more than a fraction of a second. I‚Äôm not going to harp on this because this is more of a Spotify problem than an Apple Watch issue, but given how many people use the music app, it would do both companies good to make this complication work better. I‚Äôd love to see more useful complications from other apps too.</p><p>One last note on the Series 7‚Äôs screen: Though its actual peak brightness hasn‚Äôt changed, Apple has tweaked the system so that the Always On display is up to 70 percent brighter when you‚Äôre indoors. This way, it‚Äôs easier to read if you have your hand hidden below a table while you‚Äôre at a meeting.</p><h2>Battery life, charging and performance</h2><p>That pretty much sums up all the screen-related updates on the Series 7. But there are a few other noteworthy upgrades. The most significant of these is that it charges faster, and in about 10 minutes, I got close to 10 percent capacity. It reached almost 100 percent in under an hour with the new cable that Apple includes in the box. Meanwhile, the Apple Watch SE only got to about 60 percent in an hour.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f7478130-2b96-11ec-a1fb-7ab26f0589b0" alt="The new QWERTY keyboard on the Apple Watch Series 7." data-uuid="e57f1f38-3af0-34ef-a52d-80d4e446db6b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>You‚Äôll need both the new charger and the Series 7 to get these faster charging speeds, by the way. It‚Äôs the coils on both the watch and the wireless disc that enable the higher rate, so this isn‚Äôt something you can get just by running out and buying a new accessory. As someone who‚Äôs constantly forgetting to charge my watch until I&#39;m about to run out the door, I appreciate the faster speeds. That said, I still wish smartwatches in general lasted longer and took less time to charge.</p><p>Speaking of the battery, the Series 7 promises the same runtime as its predecessor, which is to say, about 18 hours. I generally found myself getting about half a day more from the new watch than the SE, despite the lack of an Always On display on the SE. The Series 7 usually stuck around for a day and a half, almost two, with the screen set to Always On, and tracking between three and five workouts. I also used the device to send plenty of messages and map my walks while I ran errands with the GPS on. That endurance is impressive given the larger screen, but it‚Äôs worth noting that I haven‚Äôt used the watch for sleep tracking yet.</p><p>The battery efficiency can be partly attributed to Apple‚Äôs new S7 system-in-package (SIP), which is based on the same processor as the S6. In general, I didn‚Äôt feel much of a difference between the Series 7 and the SE when launching workouts or getting Siri to text my friends. The Apple Watch has been and continues to be a responsive device that feels as fast as, if not faster than, its Android counterparts.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/18adc460-2b97-11ec-88fb-058d5a0b0624" alt="The battery page on the Apple Watch Series 7." data-uuid="adae6ef5-c9d1-303b-a7c9-285d3100dd7d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p></p><h2>Sleep tracking, watchOS 8 and other updates</h2><p>One area where Apple continues to lag the competition is sleep tracking. While companies like Fitbit and Samsung can use their wearables‚Äô heart rate monitors to detect what sleep zone you‚Äôre in, Apple still doesn‚Äôt offer that. And you‚Äôll need to make sure you have the Sleep Focus mode on (either manually or by setting a schedule) before the Watch will log your slumber. The others are all able to automatically tell when you‚Äôve gone to sleep and don‚Äôt need you to set a schedule. In fact, Fitbit has been doing it since 2015.</p><p>The Series 7 does usher in a new feature that logs your respiration rate while you sleep, and then tells you your breath-per-minute rate the next morning. Cool. Respiratory tracking is something that‚Äôs coming via watchOS 8 and isn‚Äôt exclusive to the Series 7, and the same is true of features like the new Mindfulness app, guided meditation sessions, redesigned Photos app, SharePlaying Fitness+ workouts and more. This means they‚Äôre less likely to sway your decision on whether to get the Series 7 if you already have an Apple Watch. The main things exclusive to the Series 7 are the Modular Duo and Contour watch faces, larger font sizes and buttons, and the QWERTY keyboard.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/5b370030-2b97-11ec-b7f3-7e614289c1b4" alt="The all apps page in grid view on the Apple Watch Series 7." data-uuid="8da67b38-07aa-3973-a561-f883c426c7b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p></p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>Though the differences between the Series 6 and 7 seem minor, it&#39;s worth a reminder that most people who own last year‚Äôs model likely aren‚Äôt looking to upgrade yet anyway. For anyone else who‚Äôs looking for a new smartwatch, the Series 7 will be a satisfying purchase, especially if you‚Äôve never used one before. WatchOS is a capable and comprehensive system that can help you track your workouts, automatically log your sessions, prompt you to be more active and mindful of your mental health all while being a great extension of your smartphone. It‚Äôs not the best at sleep-tracking, though, so if that‚Äôs a priority you might prefer a Fitbit. Despite its relatively high starting price <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:of $400" href="https://amzn.to/3iXCNxT">of $400</a>, what Apple offers is currently the best in the market, especially for the iOS ecosystem.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">61cd880b-921f-4f77-b6e6-955ff0f333d9</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 13:00:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634130711</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T13:11:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/76dc4a80-2b96-11ec-a6a6-1afca201cc47" width="1900" height="1267" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ed61c5f0-2c26-11ec-bfff-fc22ded728bb" width="1861" height="1090" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AMD's Radeon RX 6600 is a $329 GPU for 1080p gaming]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the end of July, AMD announced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-unveils-the-radeon-rx-6600-xt-gpu-designed-for-1080-p-gaming-033049778.html">Radeon RX 6600XT</a>, a video card the company billed as its 1080p flagship. For its final GPU release of 2021, it has unveiled the Radeon RX 6600. It&#39;s a video card that offers 28 compute units, a 2,044MHz game clock and up to 8GB of GDDR6 memory. On paper, that makes it only slightly less powerful than the RX 6600XT, which comes with 32 compute units, a 2,359MHz game clock and 8GB of GDDR6 RAM.</p><p>On average, AMD claims the RX 6600 is 23 percent faster than NVIDIA‚Äôs last generation RTX 2060 and about on par with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-release-date-185849067.html">RTX 3060</a> while delivering better per watt performance. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the company says players can expect an average of 70 frames per second at max settings in 1080p. In less visually demanding titles like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/resident-evil-village-release-date-may-7-2021-224214298.html"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitman-3-epic-games-store-exclusive-150053170.html"><em>Hitman 3</em></a><em>,</em> you can expect on average more than 100 frames per second, according to AMD.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Notably, AMD didn‚Äôt say how the RX 6600 performs in esports titles like <em>Valorant </em>and <em>Overwatch</em>. Presumably, it should be able to put up the kind of frame rates you need to drive a single Full HD monitor at 240Hz or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-nvidia-360hz-esports-display-gsync-asus-rog-swift-360.html">360Hz</a>. The more interesting tidbit about the RX 6600 is that it can play some games at 1440p. In <a href="https://www.engadget.com/far-cry-6-release-date-gameplay-trailer-182030303.html"><em>Far Cry 6</em></a>, for example, AMD says it‚Äôs possible to get a very playable 62 frames per second at the higher resolution.</p><p>The RX 6600 will also ship with ray-tracing support out of the box. Here the company claims you can get more than 60 frames per second while playing <em>Far Cry 6</em> at both 1080p and 1440p, provided you also take advantage of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/unity-nvidia-dlss-support-game-engine-164535941.html">DLSS-like</a> FidelityFX Super Resolution upscaling technology. Ray-tracing performance has consistently been a weak point among AMD‚Äôs RDNA 2 GPUs, so we‚Äôll have to see if the RX 6600 lives up to the claims.</p><p>One other point AMD was eager to get across is that RX 6600 only needs 132 watts of board power. So you‚Äôll only need a power supply unit with about 450 watts of total power to run the GPU, making it an upgrade that should be easy to add to most computers.</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Radeon RX 6600" href="https://amzn.to/3awKI0n">Radeon RX 6600</a> is available today from AMD board partners like ASUS, Gigabyte and XFX, with pricing for the GPU starting at $329. AMD CEO Lisa Su recently said she expects the current global chip shortage to continue through into the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/27/amd-ceo-lisa-su-says-chip-shortage-likely-to-end-next-year.html">second half of 2022</a>, so we anticipate supply of the RX 6600 will be hard to come by.</p><p>In the meantime, if you‚Äôre still using a Radeon 5000 series GPU, the good news is that AMD is expanding support for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amd-smart-access-memory-zen-2-cpus-161011253.html">Smart Access Memory</a> feature to cards in that family.

The Mac Mini M1 has an eight-core CPU and an eight-core GPU, plus a 16-core Neural Engine that handles machine learning tasks.

This was just after the advent of the company‚Äôs first iPhone Pro models with pro level features, like surgical-grade stainless steel and, er, three cameras. Fast-forward to now, just after the launch of the iPhone 13 series, and I still don‚Äôt have my USB-C iPhone. Fortunately, there are engineers that like a challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>On his YouTube channel, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology student Ken Pillonel teased an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-usb-c-i-phone-becomes-a-reality-thanks-to-a-robotics-engineer-113556672.html">iPhone X with a USB-C port</a>, promising a full video later on how it was done. In an earlier video, he also explained how he reverse-engineered the Lightning connector, pulling out an integrated circuit from a third-party cable and hooking it all up to a USB-C connector. Yes, this is not something most of us should attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>It‚Äôs certainly possible for Apple to do the same, given the iPad Pro and new mini have USB-C ports.

In an effort to curb verbal abuse in <em>League of Legends</em>, Riot Games has decided to disable /all chats for publicly matchmade games ‚Äî temporarily, at least. The feature gives players a way to communicate with the opposing team and can be a source of fun banter. Game director Andrei Van Roon and lead game producer Jeremy Lee wrote in their <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/game-updates/disabling-all-chat/">announcement</a>, though, that at the moment, negative interactions outweigh the positives due to the rise of in-game verbal abuse this year.</p><p>Teams will still see the other&#39;s emotes and CTRL+1-2-3-4 spam, and the change doesn&#39;t affect the chat function between allies at all. Riot knows there&#39;s still verbal abuse going on within team chats, and that the move won&#39;t eliminate the behavior from the game completely. The developer deems team chats too important to disable, however, since that&#39;s what people use to strategize and coordinate their actions.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22722747/league-of-legends-all-chat-removed-patch-riot-games"><em>Polygon</em></a>, the reaction to the change has mostly been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/q6oi8k/riot_is_disabling_all_chat_in_all_matchmaking/">negative</a>, with people mentioning the fun experiences they&#39;ve had bonding with players from opposing teams. Some even claim that most toxic behavior happens within team chats instead. van Roon has since clarified on Twitter that the plan is to test the change for a couple of patches, starting with patch 11.21, and then ask players for feedback. Riot could choose to keep or reverse the change based on the feedback it gets, though it could also keep it in some regions where the response to it is largely positive</p><div id="42e00b0745464fc590f599ad1d946567"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A few more all chat test details:<br>- Plan is to test for a couple of patches, then survey player opinion<br>- Potential responses then include keeping the change, reverting it entirely, keeping it in regions positive on it and reverting elsewhere, changing which queues it applies to</p>‚Äî Andrei van Roon (@RiotMeddler) <a href="https://twitter.com/RiotMeddler/status/1447963125060276225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/riot-games-disables-cross-team-chat-league-of-legends-103543917.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">57f223fc-7939-4f64-85ce-b883d9cc1dfd</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 10:35:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634120391</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T10:20:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bf2706e0-2c04-11ec-992f-5f3f1d0ade89" width="1600" height="935" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bf2706e0-2c04-11ec-992f-5f3f1d0ade89" width="1600" height="935" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Riot Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[League of Legends]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[League of Legends]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Security flaws at NFT marketplace OpenSea left users' crypto wallets open to attack]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After finding itself embroiled in a controversy over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opensea-nate-chastain-nft-buying-incident-163044364.html">insider trading</a>, NFT marketplace OpenSea is getting some more bad press. The site had a critical security vulnerability that could have allowed hackers to steal users&#39; entire crypto wallets, according to security research firm Check Point Software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Check Point said it first noticed reports of stolen crypto wallets triggered by airdropped NFTs, prompting the firm to investigate OpenSea. That revealed critical security discoveries &quot;that, if exploited, could have led hackers to hijack user accounts and steal entire crypto wallets of users, by sending malicious NFTs,&quot; the company said.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The attack relied on user inattention and the fact that OpenSea already generates a lot of pop-ups. If the victim received and viewed a malicious NFT sent by a hacker, it triggered a pop-up from OpenSea&#39;s storage domain, requesting a connection to the victim&#39;s cryptocurrency wallet. Clicking on the popup gave the hacker access to the wallet and allowed them to generate another popup. If the user also clicked on that without noticing a note describing the transaction, the attacker could theoretically steal all their money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It seemed that a lot of things needed to go wrong for the attack to work, and it&#39;s not clear if it was actively exploited. Check Point said it disclosed the vulnerability as soon as it found it, and OpenSea said it implemented a fix &quot;within an hour of it being brought to our attention.&quot; The company said it&#39;s &quot;doubling down on community education around security,&quot; by adding a blog series and taking other measures.&nbsp;</p><p>The security research firm said that given the rapid pace of innovation, &quot;there is an inherent challenge in securely integrating software applications and crypto markets.&quot; Bad actors are also drawn to crypto like wasps to <em>pain au chocolat</em>, so it&#39;s likely we&#39;ll hear about similar attacks in the near future.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/open-sea-vulnerability-exposed-crypto-wallets-to-attack-security-researchers-say-100028216.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">462e6101-7c8c-4890-bc68-0745484c031d</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 10:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634118971</ingested><modified>2021-10-13T09:56:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2d0bd7f0-124f-11ec-9d5b-406f59cf7dbc" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2d0bd7f0-124f-11ec-9d5b-406f59cf7dbc" width="3543" height="2362" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OpenSea logo displayed on a phone screen and representation of cryptocurrencies are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on August 26, 2021.

It‚Äôs an issue that local governments around the world have pushed mobility companies to address since day one. And after working on the problem since 2019, Bird thinks it has a solution.</p><p>Collaborating with a firm called <a href="https://www.u-blox.com/en"><ins>U-blox</ins></a>, the company has developed a custom multi-sensor and GPS module it says is far more accurate than other solutions at detecting when someone drives a scooter onto a sidewalk. When you drive a Bird scooter that‚Äôs equipped with the module onto a sidewalk, it will produce an audible sound and send a notification to your smartphone. The vehicle will also slowly and smoothly come to a stop.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Bird is testing the technology in Milwaukee and San Diego and plans to bring it to Madrid and other cities in the future.</p><p>For Bird, coming to this point has been a long journey. At one point, the company tried using AI-assisted cameras for sidewalk detection but found they presented two problems. One, they would have added a fragile component to a vehicle that‚Äôs already frequently <a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/12/electric-scooter-bird-lime-lakes-rivers-environment-vandalism.html"><ins>vandalized</ins></a>. Two, training the machine learning software that would power those cameras would have proven difficult due to the ways road infrastructure in different countries can look. According to Bird, the advantage of its latest solution is that it‚Äôs a solution it can implement at scale without worrying about the weather or vandalism.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bird-u-blox-sidewalk-detection-module-100016730.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9e974cf8-bb2c-4056-8c5d-ae2e5dcf55d2</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 13 Oct 2021 10:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634078502</ingested><modified>2021-10-12T22:41:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/853a4a60-2ba9-11ec-acff-fa76b34af919" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/853a4a60-2ba9-11ec-acff-fa76b34af919" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bird]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bird sidewalk detection]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bird sidewalk detection]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
