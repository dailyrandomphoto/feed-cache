But since they have a couple more bells and whistles when compared to the standard Fire Kids tablets, these slabs come at a premium. However, Amazon has discounted the entire lineup, so you can grab one of the tablets for as low as $60. That&#39;s the price of the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fire 7 Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3D9VbLE">Fire 7 Pro</a>, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fire HD 8 Kids Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3D6Slab">Fire HD 8 Kids Pro</a> has dropped to $90 and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Fire HD 10 Kids Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3B4SfPE">Fire HD 10 Kids Pro</a> is on sale for $140.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3D9VbLE" id="d5ff260986724d7b88e39770c6b79428" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fire 7 Kids Pro at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3D6Slab" id="d521aa817b9e41e9bb21a9d483dc0d7f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fire HD 8 Kids Pro at Amazon - $90</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3B4SfPE" id="f31ebaaa780b4162b4ea322c45e3102a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Fire HD 10 Kids Pro at Amazon - $140</a><p>Designed for kids ages six and up, the Fire Kids Pro tablets are similar to the standard kid-friendly slabs in that they come with a two-year warranty, a protective case and one year of Amazon Kids+. The latter also includes more content better suited for school-aged children rather than toddlers, including things like content from <em>National Geographic</em>, LEGO, Rabbids Coding and others. Kids Pro tablets also have a digital store in which parents can approve all apps purchases and downloads that their children request. That&#39;s on top of the standard parental controls that come with all Fire Kids tablets, making these slabs good options for parents that want to keep a close eye on what their children are doing while on their devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The biggest difference between the various Kids Pro tablets is their screen sizes — 7-, 8- and 10-inch models are available, and unsurprisingly, the Fire HD 10 Kids Pro also has the most power. It runs on an octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM, and should last up to 12 hours on a single charge. While the Fire 7 Kids Pro is best for those with tight budgets, we&#39;d recommend upgrading to the Fire HD 8 Kids Pro for, at the very least, its USB-C charging port (the 7-inch tablet relies on a dated microUSB port).</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazons-fire-kids-pro-tablets-are-up-to-40-percent-off-right-now-140525814.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ab44063-60cd-4299-9393-dfc2692cae42</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 14:05:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633356049</ingested><modified>2021-10-04T14:00:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b274f6f0-251a-11ec-a1ff-68930f7548d0" width="1985" height="1323" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b274f6f0-251a-11ec-a1ff-68930f7548d0" width="1985" height="1323" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Netflix's shuffle play feature for Android is now available to everyone]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in April, Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-play-something-shuffle-play-feature-160057616.html">released</a> its Play Something feature for TV devices with the promise of making it available on mobile in the near future. If you&#39;ve been waiting for it to make its way to your phone, you&#39;ll be thrilled to know that the time has come: The streaming giant&#39;s shuffle play functionality will start rolling out to all Android users around the world today.&nbsp;</p><p>Streaming services have such a wide variety of choices, which keep growing every day,  that scrolling through them and deciding on what to play could take hours. If you don&#39;t have anything specific to watch at the moment, the Play Something feature could held you fend off decision paralysis and prevent you from wasting what little time you have to relax. Just tap it to watch something the service&#39;s algorithm thinks you might enjoy based on your history.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-shuffle-button-mobile-005939580.html">started testing</a> the feature for both adult and kids&#39; profiles on Android in May, and a spokesperson told us testing for iOS will begin in the coming months. According to the streaming giant, users have been <a href="https://twitter.com/jengolbeck/status/1370218863741304840?s=20">loving</a> its shuffle play function for leading them to hidden gems they might not have found otherwise. Of course, the opposite could also be true if it turns out that Netflix&#39;s algorithm doesn&#39;t know you at all.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find the floating Play Something button at different places within the app, including the home screen. If you&#39;re viewing the page of a specific show, a button that says Play Something Else will show up. Patrick Flemming, Netflix&#39;s Director of Product Innovation, said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Play Something helps Netflix members discover new shows and movies when they don’t want to make decisions. Today, we&#39;re excited to bring this feature to Android, too - choosing what to watch on your phone has never been easier.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>In addition, Netflix is launching <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netflix-fast-laughs-comedy-clips-tiktok-ios-app-182351543.html">Fast Laughs</a>, its TikTok-style comedy feed that pulls funny clips from its catalog, for Android.

Case in point: The pothole featured in season 8 is literally <a href="https://twitter.com/Thatoneguy64/status/1443961536079450117?">out of shot</a> to fit the show into the modern 16:9 widescreen format.</p><p>Cropped shows have always been an issue: <em>Seinfeld </em>has been on cable TV and Hulu with similar cropping. The popularity of Netflix has simply meant the show<em>&nbsp;</em>is getting more attention at this moment in time. There are solutions. When the entire run of <em>The Simpsons</em> hit Disney+, it was similarly squashed into widescreen.

As part of iOS 15, the latest App Store update lets you &quot;report a scam or fraud&quot; for both free, in-app purchase (IAP) and paid apps, provided you&#39;ve installed the app in question.&nbsp;</p><p>The feature, detailed by <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1444814469184425988">Kosta Eleftheriou</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mazkewich/status/1444780501949194256">Richard Mazkewich</a> on Twitter, goes even farther than the previous &quot;Report a Problem&quot; feature. You can now signal a scam or a fraud and not just “Report suspicious activity,” “Report a quality issue,&quot; “Request a refund” or “Find my content” as before. Previously, you would have also needed to make an in-app purchase before you could highlight a scam or fraud, but that&#39;s no longer the case.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The &quot;Report a problem&quot; feature itself returned to individual app listings for the first time in years, as <em>The Verge</em> pointed out.

Several sections included changes that saw Apple taking a tougher stance on fraud, scams and developer misconduct, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/07/apples-new-app-store-guidelines-aim-to-crack-down-on-fraud-and-scams"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> noted at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Bad apps found on the Store included VPNs that duped customers into buying unneeded software, bad dating apps, QR readers and apps fraudulently claiming to be from major brands, the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/06/06/apple-app-store-scams-fraud/"><em>Washington Post</em></a> revealed earlier this year.

Once you&#39;ve selected a product, you can select &quot;add a gift receipt for easy returns&quot; and go to check out.

Now, the whistleblower who brought that information to light has revealed herself as Frances Haugen in an interview with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-whistleblower-misinformation-public-60-minutes-2021-10-03/"><em>60 Minutes</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/03/technology/whistle-blower-facebook-frances-haugen.html?"><em>New York Times</em></a> has reported.</p><p>&quot;I’ve seen a bunch of social networks and it was substantially worse at Facebook than what I had seen before,&quot; Haugen told <em>60 Minutes</em>. &quot;Facebook, over and over again, has shown it chooses profit over safety.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Haugen joined Facebook in 2019, working on democracy and misinformation issues, while also handling counterespionage, according to a <a href="https://www.franceshaugen.com/">personal website</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/FrancesHaugen_">Twitter account</a> she and her team set up. She worked as a Facebook product manager and left the company in May.&nbsp;</p><p>She first brought &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of pages of internal Facebook documents to Whistleblower Aid founder John Tye, requesting legal protection and help in releasing the information. The trove included internal company research, slide decks, cover letters and more. She also filed a whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), accusing Facebook of taking internal actions that didn&#39;t match its public statements.&nbsp;</p><div id="e26c0c23c027495a92e69366bfe25a97"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Whistleblower Frances Haugen is a data scientist from Iowa with a computer engineering degree and a Harvard MBA.

In one example, she said that Facebook contributed to election misinformation and the January 6th US Capitol insurrection.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Facebook has publicized its work to combat misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and insurrection,&quot; she wrote in a cover letter on the subject. &quot; In reality, Facebook knew its algorithms and platforms promoted this type of harmful content, and it failed to deploy internally recommended or lasting countermeasures.&quot;</p><p>The site allows divisive content because it promotes engagement, she noted. &quot;Its own research is showing that content that is hateful, that is divisive, that is polarizing, it’s easier to inspire people to anger than it is to other emotions,” Haugen told <em>60 Minutes</em>. “Facebook has realized that if they change the algorithm to be safer, people will spend less time on the site, they’ll click on less ads, they’ll make less money.&quot;</p><p>On top of being in touch with the SEC&#39;s whistleblower office, which normally provides protections for corporate tipsters, she and her legal team contacted Senators Richard Blumenthal (D) and Marsha Blackburn (R). She also spoke to lawmakers in France and Britain, along with a member of the European parliament.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook, which has struggled to quell leaks of late, preemptively pushed back ahead of the 60 Minutes interview, calling the accusations &quot;misleading.&quot; VP for policy and global affairs Nick Clegg told <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/03/media/reliable-sources-facebook-vp-interview/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a> that Facebook represented &quot;the good, the bad and the ugly of humanity&quot; and that it was trying to &quot;mitigate the bad, reduce it and amplify the good.&quot; He added that it was &quot;ludicrous&quot; to blame January 6th on social media.</p><p>In a statement to Engadget, Facebook spokesperson Lena Pietsch said the &quot;segment also disregards the significant investments we make to keep people safe on our platform... to suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing is just not true.&quot; The company also pushed back against any claims it was misleading the public or regulators. &quot;We stand by our public statements and are ready to answer any questions regulators may have about our work.&quot;</p><p>In the end, Haugen said she wants to help fix Facebook, not see it taken down. &quot;The path forward is about transparency and governance,” she said in the video. “It’s not about breaking up Facebook.&quot; Haugen is set to testify in Congress about issues surrounding Facebook&#39;s impact on young users on Tuesday, December 5th.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-whistleblower-reveals-identity-says-company-chooses-profits-over-safety-062311634.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">58d4c843-ce13-4a7f-8714-395499b592cb</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 06:23:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633331854</ingested><modified>2021-10-04T07:17:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3e080c90-24dd-11ec-b7ef-aef569fea93e" width="1240" height="698" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3e080c90-24dd-11ec-b7ef-aef569fea93e" width="1240" height="698" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[60 Minutes]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Frances Haugen]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Frances Haugen]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NBC Universal's channels are staying on YouTube TV]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The YouTube / NBC drama is officially over.

Given that the show was filmed years before HD was a thing, it was originally displayed in a 4:3 aspect ratio on TV (and the DVD sets that came years later). But on Netflix, the show has been cropped into a 16:9 widescreen format to fit on modern TVs. As <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/seinfeld-netflix-aspect-ratio-1236110/">noted by Rolling Stone</a>, that means some visual gags have literally been erased.&nbsp;</p><div id="5630913ada3848beb644db652430aad7"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">to emphasize, the titular pothole from the season 8 episode The Pothole is cropped out on Netflix <a href="https://t.co/gH4l5V8HfS">https://t.co/gH4l5V8HfS</a><a href="https://t.co/6G35eZQymW">pic.twitter.com/6G35eZQymW</a></p>— Brandon (spooky version) (@Thatoneguy64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Thatoneguy64/status/1443961536079450117?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Twitter users @boriskarkov and @Thatoneguy64 succinctly pointed out the problem with a specific episode called &quot;The Pothole.&quot; In the episode, George Costanza and Jerry Seinfeld are trying to find George&#39;s lost keys, which were dropped in a pothole that was then paved over. In a crop where George wildly yells at the pothole, the Netflix crop removes the pothole entirely. The 16:9 aspect ratio probably also cuts out some other gags in the series — or at the very least, it might be a jarring experience for people used to how the show originally looked.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, this isn&#39;t a new problem. Crops of <em>Seinfeld </em>have been on cable TV for years, and Hulu also showed the series in 16:9, as well. Given Netflix&#39;s popularity, <em>Seinfeld</em> is getting lots of extra attention right now, and thus a bunch of new viewers are probably checking it out who might not have seen it on Hulu. A similar controversy happened in late 2019 when the entire run of <em>The Simpsons </em>hit Disney+. After plenty of complaints about missed visual gags, Disney eventually released the seasons that aired in 4:3 in their original aspect ratio. Hopefully Netflix will do the same thing with <em>Seinfeld </em>— but in the meantime, as with many classic shows, the most authentic way to watch them is probably on DVD.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/seinfeld-netflix-hd-cropping-removes-jokes-183004013.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">71ad7beb-bb47-4a0a-8319-0c78ed09c4c8</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 18:30:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633277413</ingested><modified>2021-10-03T16:10:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/98ec7700-6534-11ea-bfdd-685e43e81484" width="2200" height="1595" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-03/98ec7700-6534-11ea-bfdd-685e43e81484" width="2200" height="1595" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Reuters Photographer / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Actor and comedian Jerry Seinfeld comments on the induction of the "puffy shirt" (R) into the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, in Washington November 18, 2004.

There have been plenty of rumors about a totally redesigned MacBook Pro coming out this fall, and the reliable Mark Gurman at <em>Bloomberg </em>reported in his Power On newsletter that an M1X-powered MacBook Pro will arrive &quot;in the next month.&quot; Apple has typically held Mac-focused events in October or early November; the first M1-based Macs were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-event-news-roundup-195533790.html">announced in early November of last year</a>.</p><p>As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/10/03/macbook-pro-m1x-release-date-information/">noted by <em>9to5Mac</em></a><em>, </em>Gurman predicts that there will be two M1X variants, both 10-core processors with eight high-performance cores and two efficiency cores. The difference between the two chips are in the graphics department — Apple may be offering an M1X with either 16 or 32 graphics cores. As for Apple&#39;s other Macs, Gurman says that the company is working on a high-performance chip for a future Mac Pro, and an M2 for the MacBook Air, iMac and lower-end MacBook Pro models.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rumors have swirled all year long about Apple&#39;s next MacBook Pro revision; the first 13-inch M1 model that was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">released last fall </a>was essentially identical to the one it replaced, aside from the Apple Silicon inside.

The Studio Buds impressed us enough to give them a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">score of 84</a>, and we consider them to be the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best Beats earbuds for most people</a>. They have a small, comfortable design with IPX4 water resistance, which will make them good companions during workouts. The sound quality is good with (unsurprisingly) punchy bass, and they support Apple&#39;s Spatial Audio feature, too. Active noise cancellation is good as well and it uses adaptive gain control to adjust in real-time based on the noises in your environment. While ANC use will affect battery life, you should be able to get five to eight hours of use on a single charge.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Since they are technically Apple earbuds, the Beats Studio Buds have the H1 chip inside, allowing them to pair and switch easily between Apple devices. But Android users can also get some of that convenience now that the Studio Buds support Fast Pair, a feature which allows Android devices to quickly recognize the buds during the initial setup. The earbuds also work with Find My Device on Android, so you can always see their last known location.</p><p>There are a few downsides to the Studio Buds, though. Notably, their case doesn&#39;t support wireless charging, and they don&#39;t have onboard volume controls or sound customizations. However, Beats fans will likely overlook those shortcomings to get an attractive, reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a sound profile they&#39;re sure to enjoy.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-discounted-to-125-new-record-low-price-amazon-133044728.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6cf319c7-851d-4d67-8f33-ff5ac89f2f13</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 13:30:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633267037</ingested><modified>2021-10-03T13:17:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ada5f940-ccb3-11eb-bdbf-a13df25bdcb3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ada5f940-ccb3-11eb-bdbf-a13df25bdcb3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Beats’ latest true wireless earbuds have a design with more universal appeal than its Powerbeats Pro.

That means all of these models are a few years old at this point, but they remain some of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">best true wireless earbuds</a> you can get if you live within the Apple ecosystem. AirPods Pro earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">score of 87</a> from us for their improved sound quality, better fitting design with IPX4 water resistance and convenient features like hands-free Siri access.

They have decent sound and good wireless range, plus a solid five-hour battery life, too. But what sets any pair of AirPods apart is their fast pairing and switching between Apple devices. The H1 chip inside allows them to recognize which device you&#39;re actively using and switch to it, so you can go form taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your Mac.</p><p>Aside from the AirPods Pro, the kicker in Amazon&#39;s sale is the wireless charging case — they originally cost $199 but have been hovering at $159 for months. The last time we saw them close to this $129 record low was in early August. And that means you&#39;re only paying $20 extra for the wireless charging case, which is a great deal.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-pro-limited-time-sale-179-amazon-125010879.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">68cda3f1-667f-42ac-bd45-ce69382af009</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 03 Oct 2021 12:50:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633265414</ingested><modified>2021-10-03T12:50:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/bd13d570-cdc0-11ea-bddb-696b5bd00b0a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-07/bd13d570-cdc0-11ea-bddb-696b5bd00b0a" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla sales continue to surge in the face of chip shortages]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the third quarter of 2021 <a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q3-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries">Tesla sold 241,300 cars</a>.

This is not to say that real conspiracies do not exist. Watergate, the tobacco companies’ collusion to obfuscate the link between cigarette smoking and cancer, and the George W. Bush–era NSA program to secretly spy on civilian Internet users are all examples of real-life conspiracies, which were discovered through evidence and exposed after exhaustive investigation.</p><p>By contrast, what makes conspiracy theory reasoning so odious is that whether or not there is any evidence, the theory is asserted as true, which puts it beyond all reach of being tested or refuted by scientists and other debunkers. The distinction, therefore, should be between actual conspiracies (for which there should be some evidence) and conspiracy theories (which customarily have no credible evidence). We might define a conspiracy theory as an “explanation that makes reference to hidden, malevolent forces seeking to advance some nefarious aim.” Crucially, we need to add that these tend to be “highly speculative [and] based on no evidence. They are pure conjecture, without any basis in reality.”</p><p>When we talk about the danger of conspiracy theories for scientific reasoning, our focus should therefore be on their nonempirical nature, which means that they are not even capable of being tested in the first place. What is wrong with conspiracy theories is not normally that they have already been refuted (though many have), but that thousands of gullible people will continue to believe them even when they have been debunked.</p><p>If you scratch a science denier, chances are you’ll find a conspiracy theorist. Sadly, conspiracy theories seem to be quite common in the general population as well. In a recent study by Eric Oliver and Thomas Wood they found that 50 percent of Americans believed in at least one conspiracy theory.</p><p>This included the 9/11 truther and Obama birther conspiracies, but also the idea that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is deliberately withholding a cure for cancer, and that the Federal Reserve intentionally orchestrated the 2008 recession. (Notably, the JFK assassination conspiracy was so widely held that it was excluded from the study.)</p><p>Other common conspiracy theories — which run the range of popularity and outlandishness — are that “chemtrails” left by planes are part of a secret government mind-control spraying program, that the school shootings at Sandy Hook and Parkland were “false flag” operations, that the government is covering up the truth about UFOs, and of course the more “science-related” ones that the Earth is flat, that global warming is a hoax, that some corporations are intentionally creating toxic GMOs, and that COVID-19 is caused by 5G cell phone towers.</p><p>In its most basic form, a conspiracy theory is a non-evidentially justified belief that some tremendously unlikely thing is nonetheless true, but we just don’t realize it because there is a coordinated campaign run by powerful people to cover it up. Some have contended that conspiracy theories are especially prevalent in times of great societal upheaval. And, of course, this explains why conspiracy theories are not unique to modern times. As far back as the great fire of Rome in 64 AD, we saw conspiracy theories at work, when the citizens of Rome became suspicious over a weeklong blaze that consumed almost the entire city — while the emperor Nero was conveniently out of town. Rumors began to spread that Nero had started it in order to rebuild the city in his own design. While there was no evidence that this was true (nor for the legend that Nero sang while the city burned), Nero was apparently so upset by the accusation that he started his own conspiracy theory that it was in fact the Christians who were responsible, which led to the prevalence of burning them alive.</p><p>Here one understands immediately why conspiracy theories are anathema to scientific reasoning. In science, we test our beliefs against reality by looking for disconfirming evidence. If we find only evidence that fits our theory, then it might be true. But if we find any evidence that disconfirms our theory, it must be ruled out. With conspiracy theories, however, they don’t change their views even in the face of disconfirming evidence (nor do they seem to require much evidence, beyond gut instinct, that their views are true in the first place). Instead, conspiracy theorists tend to use the conspiracy itself as a way to explain any lack of evidence (because the clever conspirators must be hiding it) or the presence of evidence that disconfirms it (because the shills must be faking it). Thus, lack of evidence in favor of a conspiracy theory is in part explained by the conspiracy itself, which means that its adherents can count both evidence and lack of evidence in their favor.</p><p>Virtually all conspiracy theorists are what I call “cafeteria skeptics.” Although they profess to uphold the highest standards of reasoning, they do so inconsistently. Conspiracy theorists are famous for their double standard of evidence: they insist on an absurd standard of proof when it concerns something they do not want to believe, while accepting with scant to nonexistent evidence whatever they do want to believe. We have already seen the weakness of this type of selective reasoning with cherry-picking evidence. Add to this a predilection for the kind of paranoid suspicion that underlies most conspiracy-minded thinking, and we face an almost impenetrable wall of doubt. When a conspiracy theorist indulges their suspicions about the alleged dangers of vaccines, chemtrails, or fluoride — but then takes any contrary or debunking information as itself proof of a cover-up — they lock themselves in a hermetically sealed box of doubt that no amount of facts could ever get them out of. For all of their protests of skepticism, most conspiracy theorists are in fact quite gullible.</p><p>Belief in the flatness of the Earth is a great example. Time and again at FEIC 2018, I heard presenters say that any scientific evidence in favor of the curvature of the Earth had been faked. “There was no Moon landing; it happened on a Hollywood set.” “All the airline pilots and astronauts are in on the hoax.” “Those pictures from space are Photoshopped.” Not only did disconfirming evidence of these claims not cause the Flat Earthers to give up their beliefs, it was used as more evidence for the conspiracy! And of course to claim that the devil is behind the whole cover-up about Flat Earth could there be a bigger conspiracy theory? Indeed, most Flat Earthers would admit that themselves. A similar chain of reasoning is often used in climate change denial. President Trump has long held that global warming is a “Chinese hoax” meant to undermine the competitiveness of American manufacturing.</p><p>Others have contended that climate scientists are fudging the data or that they are biased because they are profiting from the money and attention being paid to their work. Some would argue that the plot is even more nefarious — that climate change is being used as a ruse to justify more government regulation or takeover of the world economy. Whatever evidence is presented to debunk these claims is explained as part of a conspiracy: it was faked, biased, or at least incomplete, and the real truth is being covered up. No amount of evidence can ever convince a hardcore science denier because they distrust the people who are gathering the evidence. So what is the explanation? Why do some people (like science deniers) engage in conspiracy theory thinking while others do not?</p><p>Various psychological theories have been offered, involving factors such as inflated self-confidence, narcissism, or low self-esteem. A more popular consensus seems to be that conspiracy theories are a coping mechanism that some people use to deal with feelings of anxiety and loss of control in the face of large, upsetting events. The human brain does not like random events, because we cannot learn from and therefore cannot plan for them. When we feel helpless (due to lack of understanding, the scale of an event, its personal impact on us, or our social position), we may feel drawn to explanations that identify an enemy we can confront. This is not a rational process, and researchers who have studied conspiracy theories note that those who tend to “go with their gut” are the most likely to indulge in conspiracy-based thinking. This is why ignorance is highly correlated with belief in conspiracy theories. When we are less able to understand something on the basis of our analytical faculties, we may feel more threatened by it.</p><p>There is also the fact that many are attracted to the idea of “hidden knowledge,” because it serves their ego to think that they are one of the few people to understand something that others don’t know. In one of the most fascinating studies of conspiracy-based thinking, Roland Imhoff invented a fictitious conspiracy theory, then measured how many subjects would believe it, depending on the epistemological context within which it was presented. Imhoff’s conspiracy was a doozy: he claimed that there was a German manufacturer of smoke alarms that emitted high-pitched sounds that made people feel nauseous and depressed. He alleged that the manufacturer knew about the problem but refused to fix it. When subjects thought that this was secret knowledge, they were much more likely to believe it. When Imhoff presented it as common knowledge, people were less likely to think that it was true.</p><p>One can’t help here but think of the six hundred cognoscenti in that ballroom in Denver. Out of six billion people on the planet, they were the self-appointed elite of the elite: the few who knew the “truth” about the flatness of the Earth and were now called upon to wake the others.</p><p>What is the harm from conspiracy theories? Some may seem benign, but note that the most likely factor in predicting belief in a conspiracy theory is belief in another one. And not all of those will be harmless. What about the anti-vaxxer who thinks that there is a government cover-up of the data on thimerosal, whose child gives another measles? Or the belief that anthropogenic (human- caused) climate change is just a hoax, so our leaders in government feel justified in delay?

Trump is arguing, as expected, that the ban violates his First Amendment rights, but also Florida&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/florida-governor-signs-senate-bill-7072-213545097.html">social media law</a> signed by Governor Ron DeSantis earlier this year — though courts have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judge-blocks-florida-social-media-law-030928549.html">stopped the law from taking effect</a> on the grounds that <em>it</em> likely violates free speech laws.&nbsp;</p><p>The suit makes many predictable arguments that Twitter is “a major avenue of public discourse&quot; and that it &quot;exercises a degree of power and control over political discourse in this country that is immeasurable, historically unprecedented, and profoundly dangerous to open democratic debate.”&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Of course, Trump&#39;s ban on Twitter (as well as countless other social media platforms like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump-suspension-ban-130251901.html">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-snapchat-ban-004602436.html">Snap</a>) follows years of his flaunting the rules. The former president&#39;s tweets were a frequent source of controversy, not just because he often used them to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/14/trump-president-greta-thunberg-bullying">bully</a> political opponents and announce <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2020/11/09/trump-fires-defense-secretary-mark-esper-over-twitter/?sh=71f87ae27635">personnel changes</a> (before those involved knew), but because he also shared a constant stream of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-trump-labels-say-joe-biden-won-election-222204773.html">misinformation</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/28/us/politics/trump-white-power-video-racism.html">racist</a><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/15/741827580/go-back-where-you-came-from-the-long-rhetorical-roots-of-trump-s-racist-tweets">content</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-youtube-remove-donald-trump-video-violence-230739601.html">encouraged violence</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After years of outcry from the public over their refusal to enforce their own rules against the then president&#39;s accounts, Twitter and Facebook slowly started to crack down, labeling many of his tweets as potentially misleading — especially around <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-removes-trump-post-covid-misinformation-235014586.html">COVID-19</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-trump-labels-say-joe-biden-won-election-222204773.html">election results</a>. Things came to a head following the attempted insurrection on January 6 in which the former president encouraged his followers to storm the Capitol in an attempt to stop the peaceful transfer of power.&nbsp;</p><p>Trump&#39;s latest lawsuit claims that even the labeling of his tweets as &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-labels-trump-tweet-election-night-061539034.html">misleading</a>&quot; qualifies as a form of censorship — even though those obviously and intentionally false tweets were allowed to stay up on the site.</p><p>The new suit cites a law passed in Florida this May that would prevent social media sites from &quot;knowingly&quot; deplatforming politicians (of course, with a Disney-sized loophole baked in). The law would have allowed the state&#39;s Election Commission to fine social media companies $250,000 a day for takedowns involving public office candidates. It also allows residents to sue the companies if they feel they&#39;ve been treated &quot;unfairly&quot;, which is almost certainly legally vague. And lastly it would require that social media companies detail how bans are decided and enforce its policies consistently.</p><p>In July however a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction noting that the law potentially violated the free speech rights of private companies which have their own terms of service and standards for hosting content.</p><p>Since Florida&#39;s law has not taken effect — and there&#39;s a very good chance it never will — it&#39;s not clear how successful Trump&#39;s strategy will be.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-sues-to-get-his-twitter-account-back-143200517.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">74c7a49c-db29-42d9-bb6c-fdd63ff02b9b</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 02 Oct 2021 14:32:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633188138</ingested><modified>2021-10-02T15:22:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2ba3350-238c-11ec-beff-08b46b74c8a3" width="3110" height="2069" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/d38d5070-237d-11eb-b3dc-e1ea0762fa9f" width="4629" height="3088" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carlos Barria / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[U.S. President Donald Trump departs after speaking about the 2020 U.S. presidential election results in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House in Washington, U.S., November 5, 2020.

After announcing the Plex mobile-first bank accounts <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-is-scrapping-its-plan-to-offer-bank-accounts-to-users-11633104001">in November last year with Citibank</a> and a few other financial institutions, Google is pulling back from the product. According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-is-scrapping-its-plan-to-offer-bank-accounts-to-users-11633104001">the <em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>, the company is &quot;abandoning plans to pitch bank accounts to its users.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>A Google spokesperson told Engadget that it&#39;s &quot;updating our approach to focus primarily on delivering digital enablement for banks and other financial services providers rather than us serving as the provider of these services.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Plex was initially positioned as an easy mobile-first way to open bank accounts, with Google providing the technology and app design and banks and credit providers backing the finances. It sounded more like a way to help institutions that didn&#39;t yet have a modern, competent app to team up with Google on one, which might be why major names like Bank of America and Capital One, who already had existing apps, weren&#39;t on the list of partners.</p><p>According to the <em>Journal</em>, a Citibank spokesperson said it plans to recommend other accounts to people who had already signed up for the Plex waiting list.

Just accept it for what it is or ignore it all together because that polarizing piece of design that actually doesn’t feed a radiator like it does the gas-powered X5. Instead it has a few sensors and it’s really a design feature. But look past it because behind it is BMW’s fifth-generation EV system, which is actually great.</p><p>While the inside of the iX carries the torch of the now-discontinued i3, the limitations of that vehicle, namely its short range, are gone. The iX starting at $83,200 has a targeted range of about 300 miles. Beyond the design, it handles and drives like a next-generation EV with a plethora of features that’ll make first adopters and those migrated from the gas-powered BMWs happy. We had a chance to drive it around Germany; watch the video above for our thoughts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bmw-ix-ev-first-drive-video-193002612.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d84525f1-b476-4ee0-94a1-dacdd28ada68</guid><dc:creator>Roberto Baldwin</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 19:30:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633113274</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T18:34:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Roberto Baldwin]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/dbe9c020-22e4-11ec-aea3-5481c0c16318" width="2560" height="1624" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/dbe9c020-22e4-11ec-aea3-5481c0c16318" width="2560" height="1624" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[uwe Fischer / BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BMW iX]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BMW iX]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Toyota's three-wheeled 'C+walk' picks up where Segway left off]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meet the <a href="https://global.toyota/en/newsroom/toyota/35872225.html"><ins>Toyota C+walk</ins></a>. It’s a new three-wheeled electric scooter from the Japanese automaker designed to help people with limited mobility. While it shares some visual characteristics with battery electric vehicles like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bird-three-172619972.html"><ins>Bird Three</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/segway-to-end-pt-production-144305244.html"><ins>Segway PT</ins></a>, its closest antecedent is the <a href="https://media.toyota.co.uk/vehicles/concept-i-walk/"><ins>Concept-i Walk</ins></a> Toyota showed off back in 2017.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7220b730-22e3-11ec-abe4-6dd64733156a" style="height:1199;width:1600;" alt="Toyota C+walk" data-uuid="cb285a2d-a75f-3b67-aac5-8c8dad30c1af"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Toyota</div></figure><p>A removable lithium-ion battery allows the C+walk to travel about eight and a half miles on a single charge, after which it needs some two hours to recharge from zero to full. It can travel at a maximum speed of just over six miles per hour, though it’s possible to throttle it down to one mile per hour. Some of the more nifty features of the C+walk include an obstacle avoidance system. It will beep when it detects something on your path and slow down the vehicle if a collision is imminent.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Initially, the automaker envisions the scooter helping elderly workers travel across large facilities like warehouses, factories and airport terminals. In the future, the company hopes the Japanese government will certify the C+walk for use on public roads. Toyota dealers in Japan will start selling and leasing the scooter at the start of next month. It will start at ¥341,000, or just under $3,100 with the current exchange rate.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/toyota-c-plus-walk-electric-scooter-announcement-183005391.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7a6114ef-c9b4-4536-8dd3-a7ca475db635</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 18:45:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633112810</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T18:26:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2ef2d6f0-22e3-11ec-9ff7-aa23210b0383" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2ef2d6f0-22e3-11ec-9ff7-aa23210b0383" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Toyota]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[C+walk]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[C+walk]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iOS 15 update to fix Apple Watch unlock bug is here]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve had your <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-iphone-unlock-macos-tvos-homepod-181749610.html">iPhone set up to unlock with your Apple Watch</a> and recently upgraded to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">an iPhone 13</a>, a software bug may have prevented you from continuing to use this. Thankfully, a fix is here and once you install it, you shouldn&#39;t have to resort to Face ID (or worse, typing in your passcode) anymore. The latest iOS 15 update (iOS 15.0.1) is here and according to the changelog, it brings bug fixes &quot;including an issue where some users could not unlock iPhone 13 models with Apple Watch.&quot;</p><p>Apple added the unlock with Watch feature in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-iphone-unlock-macos-tvos-homepod-181749610.html">watchOS 7.4 earlier this year</a> to make it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-14-5-face-id-mask-fitness-plus-developer-beta-182712559.html">easier to get into your iPhone</a> while you&#39;re out and masked up. This feature later got broken with a subsequent iOS and update and required <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-7-1-apple-watch-unlock-with-iphone-fix-191917256.html">another over-the-air package</a> to fix. Apple recently acknowledged that this was also not working on some iPhone 13 models, and said it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-iphone-13-unlock-bug-fix-174529852.html">would roll out a solution soon</a>. The iPhone 13 only started being available on September 24th, so this issue was at least caught early. Though it&#39;s nice that the update is here days later, it&#39;s interesting to see the trouble the company has had with this feature in the last few months.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-fix-watch-unlock-bug-182431259.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a7b15730-79da-4f1b-9fa3-37cf7d125a78</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 01 Oct 2021 18:24:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1633112673</ingested><modified>2021-10-01T18:24:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb452190-1cfe-11ec-af5f-6db0f202f959" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/eb452190-1cfe-11ec-af5f-6db0f202f959" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The iPhone 13 Pro, held face up in a person's hand, with the iOS 15 home screen in view.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 13 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
