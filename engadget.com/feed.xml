The Pixel 6 handset has an OLED display, a dual-camera setup plus support for dual SIM cards, WiFi 6 and USB-C charging, while the Pixel 6 Pro has a 120Hz LTPO OLED screen, a triple rear camera system and 12GB of RAM.

One of the smartphone&#39;s kicker lies under the screen — fingerprint reader that you can use to unlock the device. The handset also has Google&#39;s Titan M2 security chip for enhanced security, along with camera and mic toggles.</p><p>When it comes to cameras, the Pixel 6 has a 50MP wide lens and a 12MP ultra wide shoot on the back, plus an 8MP front-facing camera. The rear setup can shoot video in up to 4K/60fps while the front camera tops out at 1080p/30fps. Google added a bunch of new camera features to the smartphone, too, including Magic Eraser, which automatically suggests objects like random people or cars to remove from a shot, Face Unblur and Motion Mode.</p><p>Inside the Pixel 6 is Google&#39;s Tensor processor, 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. Google claims it has a &quot;beyond 24-hour&quot; battery life and that you can get up to 48 hours of use in Extreme Battery Saver mode. It supports fast charging, so you can get 50 percent of juice in just 30 minutes, and you can power up with wireless chargers, too. It has one USB-C port along with support for 5G, WiFi 6 and dual SIM cards.</p><h2>Google Pixel 6 Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/15af63f0-30e6-11ec-994c-24b17144c8b3" style="height:1327;width:1920;" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro" data-uuid="eeb454f9-e258-327b-a16e-4a9e2f2126f6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:other;pdid:Pixel 6 Pro smartphone" href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_6_pro?hl=en-US">Pixel 6 Pro smartphone</a> is available for pre-order today for $899 and will be widely available starting October 28.

It automatically adjusts the refresh rate depending on what you&#39;re doing and it can go as low as 10Hz to save battery. The key differences between the Pixel 6 Pro and the regular Pixel 6 are in battery size and cameras. The 6 Pro has a slightly larger battery, but Google gives the same battery life estimations for both handsets. Both also support fast charging and wireless charging.</p><p>The Pixel 6 Pro has one extra rear camera: a 48MP telephoto shooter that supports super-res zoom up to 20x. That&#39;s on top of the 50MP wide camera and the 12MP ultra wide lenses that also appear on the regular Pixel 6. The 6 Pro also has a slightly better front-facing camera, which is a 11MP shooter with a wider, 94-degree field of view.</p><p>The Pixel 6 Pro has all of the same security features that its smaller counterpart does, including the under-display fingerprint sensor. It also runs on the same processor but comes with 12GB of RAM — storage options remain the same, too.</p><p><em>Catch up on all the latest news from </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Pixel%206%20event"><em>Google&#39;s Pixel 6 event</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-smartphones-173051481.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c543f59-43ed-4719-afd3-ffaa6370b737</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 17:30:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634664287</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T17:24:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7374f040-30ff-11ec-bfff-082e73d99e32" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/7374f040-30ff-11ec-bfff-082e73d99e32" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Pixel 6 Pro vs. the competition: Telephoto, Tensor and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year&#39;s Pixel came and went with only one screen size available, and for this year&#39;s flagship Google&#39;s giving you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-price-specs-release-date-170039729-170024290.html">two options again</a>.

On Tuesday, Google <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/meet-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro/">explained</a> what sorts of cameras and image capture systems the new handsets will offer when they go on sale October 28th.&nbsp;</p><p>Both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro will come equipped with a 50-megapixel Octa PD Quad Bayer wide camera (the base 6 will additionally feature 7x Super Res Zoom) as well as a 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera. Their new 1/1.3 inch rear sensors reportedly capture up to 150 percent more light than the Pixel 5. The 6 Pro will also sport a 48-megapixel telephoto camera with 4x optical and 20x Super Res Zoom functionality. Around front, the base 6 will offer an 8-megapixel camera while the 6 Pro gets a 12-megapixel camera.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both models can capture video in 1080p and 4K (at either 30 or 60 FPS) with their rear cameras, as well as 240 FPS slo-mo. The 6 Pro&#39;s front camera can record at both 1080p (30 and 60 FPS) or in 4K at 30 FPS. The base 6&#39;s front however can only record at 1080p resolution at 30 FPS.</p><p>Editing photos should be a much more streamlined process than with past models, thanks to the Pixel 6&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html">Tensor</a> SOC integration. Users will be able to leverage the <a href="https://blog.google/products/photos/magic-eraser/">Magic Eraser</a> which can quickly and seamlessly remove random objects and even people from the background of shots. What&#39;s really cool is that Magic Eraser will work on any photo you have, whether you just captured it using the Pixel 6 or dug it out of your Google Photos archive. The system will automatically recommend distractions to remove from your shots, though you can just as easily manually circle items that you want erased.&nbsp;</p><p>Motion Mode features options like Action Pan and Long Exposure, which do exactly what they sound like they do, are available as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>developing...</em></p><p><em>Catch up on all the latest news from </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Pixel%206%20event"><em>Google&#39;s Pixel 6 event</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pixel-6-camera-will-feature-larger-image-sensors-and-smarter-photo-editing-ai-171159356.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a95b2d19-d041-4f82-9181-b7acfea28f9d</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 17:11:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634664802</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T17:33:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c5fda190-30ff-11ec-bff7-6bcd36986021" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/c5fda190-30ff-11ec-bff7-6bcd36986021" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[pixel 6]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[pixel 6]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Real Tone is Google's attempt at a more inclusive Android camera]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At Google I/O in May, Android VP Sameer Samat <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-camera-pixel-inclusive-skin-tones-190340677.html">announced an initiative</a> to build a more racially inclusive camera for the company&#39;s Pixel devices, with better support for non-white hairstyles and darker skin tones. Today, Google confirmed the cameras on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will support this technology, and gave it a name — Real Tone.</p><p>Google partnered with &quot;a diverse set of expert image makers and photographers&quot; to tune its new camera algorithms, including adjustments to automatic white balance, automatic exposure and stray light settings. The goal, in the company&#39;s words, is to &quot;ensure that Google’s camera and imagery products work for everyone, of every skin tone.&quot; Considering Google&#39;s consumer base has <em>always </em>included humans of every skin tone, and this is the <em>sixth </em>iteration of the Pixel, it&#39;s about time these considerations were made.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Real Tone is built into the cameras of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, and there&#39;s no way to disable it.

We knew it would be powering the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-price-specs-release-date-170039729-170024290.html">Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</a>, and much like Apple&#39;s A-series mobile chips, it was an attempt at tying together Google&#39;s software with some custom-tuned hardware. In particular, Google positioned Tensor as something of an AI powerhouse, giving its new phones better hardware for image processing and voice recognition. Now, we know exactly <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-google-tensor/">what makes Tensor tick</a>.</p><p>Google&#39;s SoC is a 5nm eight-core design broken down into big, medium and small cores. Leading the way is two ARM Cortex-X1 cores running at 2.8GHz. That&#39;s notable since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">Qualcomm&#39;s flagship Snapdragon 888</a> chip, which powers Samsung&#39;s Galaxy S21 and many other high-end phones, only has a single X1 core. It&#39;ll be interesting to see just how much faster Tensor is in comparison.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Below that, the SoC also features two Cortex A76 cores running at 2.25GHz, as well as four 1.8GHz A55 cores as the &quot;small&quot; bits. Thankfully, Google didn&#39;t skimp on graphics: the Tensor also has a Mali-G78 graphics core, which you&#39;ll also find on other flagship Android phones.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3b9595b0-3101-11ec-bff1-10d936b0da9e" alt="Google Tensor chip breakdown" data-uuid="c159d1ff-29f6-3639-b937-bfb9d8f38710"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>All of the talk of custom hardware may bring to mind the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-08-05-motorola-moto-x-review.html">ill-fated (but gloriously inventive) Moto X</a>, Google&#39;s 2013-era attempt at building a smarter smartphone. It wasn&#39;t the most powerful mobile around, but its always-on voice commands were a decent step towards ambient computing, something Google is still focused on today with the Tensor chip.&nbsp;</p><p>The new SoC allow the Pixel 6 to translate videos and messages quickly with its Live Translate feature, and it&#39;ll be smarter about recognizing your voice as well. That should be particularly helpful when it comes to using your voice to type, edit and send messages. Most importantly, though, it&#39;ll be able to do all of that work without consuming much battery life. Overall, the Tensor chip will perform around 80 percent faster than the Pixel 5, according to Google. That&#39;s a lofty figure, so we&#39;ll definitely be testing the Pixel 6 heavily to confirm those numbers.</p><p>Additionally, Google says Tensor also gives the Pixel 6 an extra layer of security. It&#39;ll work together with the Titan M2 chip in the phone to protect against malware and other potential attacks. That&#39;s a good step forward for Google, and we&#39;re hoping to see more security hardware in other Android phones down the line.</p><p>At this point, Tensor appears to offer everything we&#39;d want in a new mobile chip: Fast speeds, and plenty of forward-thinking AI features. It could eventually make the Pixel phones Google&#39;s true iPhone equivalent: Flagship hardware that dances in concert with a custom mobile chip. (And if Google is truly successful, maybe Tensor could make its way over to devices from other companies.)</p><p><em>Catch up on all the latest news from </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Pixel%206%20event"><em>Google&#39;s Pixel 6 event</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-soc-pixel-6-chip-170059466.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b7f61e49-8c66-4f82-a6c3-bebac3a4168a</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 17:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634664634</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T17:30:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e0a79360-30e7-11ec-9cb7-0c840972cb8d" width="1100" height="585" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e0a79360-30e7-11ec-9cb7-0c840972cb8d" width="1100" height="585" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Tensor SoC]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Tensor SoC]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pixel Pass bundles a phone with Google services for $45 per month]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-pass-for-pixel-6-pro-194143011.html">The rumors</a> were true: Google has an answer to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-one-subscription-bundle-apple-music-apple-tv-plus-announced-174601467.html">Apple One</a> bundle. The company has <a href="https://blog.google/products/pixel/introducing-pixel-pass/">introduced</a> a Pixel Pass subscription that includes a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-and-6-pro-hands-on-tensor-features-camera-specs-available-price-170038272.html">Pixel 6 or 6 Pro</a> phone (with an upgrade in two years), an extended warranty, 200GB of Google One storage, Google Play Pass, YouTube Premium and YouTube Music Premium. In theory, you&#39;ll have everything you&#39;d want for one monthly rate.</p><p>The Pass starts at $45 per month for the regular Pixel 6, and climbs to $55 for the Pixel 6 Pro. You can subscribe through either the Google Store or Google Fi depending on your choice of carriers, but it&#39;s only available in the US for now.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google&#39;s strategy is familiar: like Apple, it&#39;s hoping to boost adoption of its services and keep you ensconced in the company&#39;s ecosystem. You may be less likely to switch to a competitor (even another Android vendor) if you feel you&#39;re getting a better bargain with the Pixel Pass. This takes things a step further by including the phone, though — you&#39;re buying the whole experience rather than just a spate of extras.</p><p>Even so, the subscription may be helpful simply by recognizing a practical reality. Many people want more than just a phone, and Google is including those modern must-haves rather than asking you to pay for them after the fact. Don&#39;t be shocked if other phone makers take this approach before long.</p><p><em>Catch up on all the latest news from </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Pixel%206%20event"><em>Google&#39;s Pixel 6 event</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pass-subscription-170056831.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">976cf3d9-b9b1-444e-8b87-ef8abcac8d34</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 17:00:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634664063</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T17:21:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0e78bb60-2c4d-11ec-bcfc-ce631a8414bc" width="1920" height="1083" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0e78bb60-2c4d-11ec-bcfc-ce631a8414bc" width="1920" height="1083" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 in peach at an angle]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 in peach at an angle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pixel 6 and 6 Pro hands-on: Google’s return to premium phones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="eff4e7fae361475f911d6eee65436cab"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/erVIyrv3PE0" title="YouTube video player" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Pixel 6 and 6 Pro" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/n1E9N6">Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</a> are finally here, and they’re the most promising phones from Google in years. That’s largely thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">Tensor, the company’s first mobile chip</a>. We’ve already seen plenty of pictures and videos of the Pixel 6, but now we actually have devices to play with and detailed specs to share. One of the highlights of the Pixel 6s are the cameras, which not only received a processing boost thanks to Tensor, but also a serious hardware upgrade.</p><p>Additionally, these handsets bring faster-refreshing screens, Android 12-exclusive features and significant voice recognition enhancements. But the best thing about the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is the reasonable price. Starting today, you can pre-order a Pixel 6 for $599 and a 6 Pro for $899, and they’ll be available on shelves October 28th.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Pixel 6 and 6 Pro hardware differences</h2><p>That’s a surprisingly low price for the Pixel 6. You’re getting a 6.4-inch Full HD screen with a 90Hz refresh rate, not to mention a 50-megapixel main rear camera (with pixel-binning), 12-megapixel wide angle lens and an 8-megapixel selfie camera. For $300 more, the Pixel 6 Pro offers a sharper 6.7-inch 1,440p screen that goes up to 120Hz and has narrower bezels. The Pro also adds a 48-megapixel telephoto lens with 4x optical zoom, and its 11.1-megapixel selfie camera is both sharper and packs a wider-angle lens.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/547861b0-305d-11ec-bddf-c85f95fd1b12" alt="Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro" data-uuid="e9ac2a72-e93c-3f13-92b1-f1a24326ec59"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The other main differences between the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are that the Pro has a larger battery and comes with 12GB of RAM, while the smaller model has 8GB. Oh, and only the Pro goes up to 512GB of storage and has an ultra wideband chip for ranging and spatial orientation.</p><p>Pretty much every other feature is standard across the two devices. They’re both powered by Google’s new Tensor chip — an octa-core system comprised of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">two &quot;Prime&quot; Arm X1</a>, two big and four small CPU cores. Both phones also have in-display fingerprint sensors, IP68 protection ratings, support for sub-6, mmWave 5G and pretty much every other standard you’d expect from a flagship in 2021.</p><h2>A return to premium design and fun colors</h2><p>The two also differ slightly in design, which marks a departure from previous years. Right off the bat, the phones feel markedly different from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">the Pixel 5</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-21-google-pixel-4-and-4-xl-review-motion-sense-cameras.html">Pixel 4</a>. Instead of a matte soft-touch texture, both Pixel 6 phones are covered in glass with gently curved edges, lending them a premium feel. I’m not a fan of their new blocky shape, and the Pro in particular feels very similar to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-s-pen-price-140017843.html">Samsung’s Note 20 Ultra</a>. Thankfully, the Pro is lighter than the Note 20 Ultra and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">iPhone 13 Pro Max</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4db2ca10-305c-11ec-bbdf-a23b532a2511" alt="The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro in coral and blush" data-uuid="fde32912-ecc3-31b9-bcad-a1d156a05702"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Both phones are also much larger than the Pixel 5, and though their screen sizes differ, they have almost the same footprint. As you’ve probably noticed in the images circulating around the internet, the focus of the backside is an approximately inch-tall bar that spans the width of the device. It houses the cameras (two for the Pixel 6 and three for the 6 Pro), and while it does protrude about half an inch from the back, it doesn’t cause much wobble when you place the handset on a flat surface.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned, the Pixel 6 has noticeably thicker bezels and its edges have a matte texture compared to the Pro’s shinier finish. They also come in a different trio of colors, and the Pixel 6 arguably has the better palette. I’m a fan of the minty blue option, and the blush version is nice too. Meanwhile, the Pro only has one fun shade that&#39;s not black or silver: the almost yellowish hue. Not everyone’s going to love it.</p><h2>Android 12 and voice recognition</h2><p>Both phones run Android 12 with some Pixel-exclusive features. The most obvious refresh is the Material You UI, which took a really long time to roll out to the beta (and arrives on Pixels first). If you’ve been following our coverage of Google’s software, you know that Material You adapts by taking the primary color elements of your home screen’s wallpaper and then applies that throughout the system.</p><p>That means you get colorful, matching hues for things like your keyboard, menu buttons, settings panel and notifications shade. Seeing it fully realized on the Pixel 6 was a treat. Good news for current Pixel owners: It will roll out to the Pixel 3 and newer devices today.</p><p>But when Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">introduced Tensor earlier this year</a>, it also promised big things were coming in areas like voice recognition and camera processing. The company teased us with some limited demos then, but at a recent briefing I was shown more of the features coming to the Pixel 6 and they’re truly intriguing.</p><p>First of all, Google has revamped its speech recognition software. Not only will the engine be better at understanding you, but it also suggests alternatives that might make more sense. For example, if you have a friend whose name is Bryan (with a ‘y’), and you’ve changed the spelling a few times from Brian (with an &#39;i&#39;), the system will note the correct spelling going forward.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/87092250-305c-11ec-bfbf-c5b90608a1a1" alt="Live Translate on the Pixel 6 messages app. An animation showing a message being typed out in English in the Messages app and simultaneously translated to Japanese." data-uuid="91a9941c-8f7a-3ddf-bb4b-b0ca6023f74a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google will also let you insert emoji by saying things like “smiley face emoji.” During my demo, I said “hot pot emoji” and the fire and pot symbols appeared. (Sadly, Unicode doesn’t have an icon for hotpot yet. Shame.) You’ll also be able to say the words “Send” or “Clear” to submit or delete your message, and go into the text to edit it while you’re speaking by tapping the error and saying what it should be. No need to switch in and out of voice typing mode.</p><p>Arguably the most interesting of the Pixel 6’s voice features is the ability to translate languages as you’re typing. A Google rep pulled up a WhatsApp chat with a friend who uses Japanese, and typed “Certainly, I will do that.” Almost simultaneously, the Japanese characters (hiragana) appeared in the text field.</p><p>My Japanese is rusty, so I’m not entirely sure the translation was accurate, but an earlier message from the conversation did appear to correctly convert “so cool” to “totemo kakkoii.” The translation happens both ways, so if your friend is sending you something in a foreign language, Google can also convert it to something you can read.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0bf4b100-305d-11ec-8eef-90c3e2277812" alt="Wait Times with Assistant calls on the Pixel 6" data-uuid="5cfcd925-e7da-3829-9d84-99682fc69831"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>One of my favorite things about Pixel phones is their call-related Assistant features. Things like Call Screen and Hold For Me keep me from wasting time on robocalls or waiting for a representative who is “currently helping other customers.” The Pixel 6 will also get a new Wait Time feature that shows you how long you can expect to hold for the top 5,000 businesses in the US and even convert those annoying menus into an onscreen interface. That’s not only great for saving you time, but can help those with hearing impairments. I didn’t get to try it out myself yet, though Google’s rep did call HBO and the Assistant seemed to accurately transcribe what the automated operator said.</p><h2>A serious camera upgrade</h2><p>The main area where the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have improved is their cameras and indeed, this is what I&#39;m most excited about. We&#39;re at a point in the smartphone camera race where all the major players deliver excellent image quality regardless of whether they’re using a 108-megapixel or 12-megapixel sensor.</p><p>So where Google needs to stand out is with special features. And there’s a long list of new ones here thanks to that Tensor chip, including a Motion mode, object eraser and real tone for more accurate processing for people with different melanin levels.</p><p>Few of these are truly new in the smartphone world. We&#39;ve seen the eraser option before on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-one-ui-3-1-update-030025770.html">Samsung phones</a>, where if there&#39;s a stray garbage can in your photo, you can select it and the system will remove it for you. During my demo, a Google rep took a picture of their colleague with passerby and a backpack in the background. They then tapped the extraneous person in the Photos app to outline and then delete them. There was a faint shadow on the wall that Google generated in its place, but it was otherwise as if there was never a person there.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/6ea0b380-305d-11ec-ade9-c474d12dadb1" alt="Close ups of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro camera bumps as the phones are laid out on a furry surface." data-uuid="9915362c-43b9-3376-999e-a9db618a9dd7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Motion mode also offers other familiar tools we’ve seen on Huawei and Sony phones. One is a long exposure setting that lets you shoot moving cars at night (or anything with lights, really) and have their tail lights appear in the image as iridescent streaks. Because my meeting took place during the day, a Google rep demonstrated this by taking pictures of videos projected onto a wall, including a waterfall. The Pixel 6 rendered beautiful light streaks and silky cascades of water. So far, I’ve been impressed by the images it produces, especially compared to samples taken with Huawei’s Light Painting mode.</p><p>The other feature in Motion mode is called Action Pan. Basically, if you have a fast moving subject, like a dog prancing through a field or a bike zooming down the street, it will let you capture a crisp photo of your subject against a motion-blurred background. Again, based on the demo at my briefing (of a Google rep cycling inside a room in circles), it seemed to work well.</p><p>With the Pixel 6 launch, Google is also officially introducing its image equity program. We&#39;ve heard a little bit about this at I/O, where the company said it’s working to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-camera-pixel-inclusive-skin-tones-190340677.html">make the Android camera more inclusive</a>. In the Pixel 6, Real Tone is baked in (not something you can turn on or off) and it should render people more accurately, and also better expose and color-balance scenes. Of course, this is something that will require more real-world testing for me to conclude it’s effective.</p><p>There&#39;s a slew of other photography-related features that I’d love to try outside of a controlled demo, including a Face Unblur tool. But while there’s plenty of software tweaks to check out, I’m also dying to grab some pictures with the new hardware. Both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro now have a 50-megapixel main sensor with f/1.85 aperture. They also have a 12-megapixel ultra-wide option that has a 114-degree field of view, and the Pro has an additional 48-megapixel telephoto lens with 4X optical zoom.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/91a42bf0-305d-11ec-9f9f-636d29742095" alt="Close up of the Pixel 6 Pro&#39;s camera bump." data-uuid="b4a44fff-ac63-3d96-9170-a9ef9414344e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>A Google rep and I stood side by side with him holding the Pixel 6 Pro and me using the iPhone 13 Pro I had on hand. Both of us zoomed to the furthest we could to capture a little Android figurine sitting on a distant couch, and Google appeared to be the clear winner. While both devices rendered the robot, when we zoomed in it was evident the Pixel 6 Pro captured more detail, clearly showing the lines between its head and body, which were basically just smudges on the iPhone.</p><p>Up front, the Pixel 6 has an 8-megapixel camera while the Pro goes up to 11.1-megapixels, and the latter can capture selfie videos at up to 4K at 30 frames per second. Both devices can shoot at 4K resolution at 60 fps with their rear cameras, and there’s a new Speech Enhancement mode to play with that will drown out background noise to focus on what you’re saying. All these will also require extended real world testing before I can tell how useful they are.</p><p>In fact, there’s plenty more to test, including battery life, Tensor’s performance and the in-display fingerprint sensor’s responsiveness.

The company released the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-12-public-183320969.html">first public beta</a> of the OS during the I/O developer conference in May, and it&#39;s been priming Android 12 for prime time since with several <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-5-final-170051810.html">other betas</a>.</p><p>Along with a major visual overhaul, Android 12 packs in a bunch of new features, including privacy and security upgrades. A Privacy Dashboard shows which sensors (such as GPS, camera or microphone) apps have accessed in a chart and displays an activity timeline. You&#39;ll be able to find out why apps needed access to data from those sensors.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>An indicator will appear at the top of the screen when an app is using the camera and/or microphone, and you can shut off those sensors completely for all apps in Quick Settings. There&#39;s an option to only allow apps to see your approximate location rather than precisely where you are too. On top of that, Android 12 will handle the processing for more language and audio features on-device, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-live-caption-for-calls-availability-150011904.html">Live Caption</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-06-google-assistant-song-id.html">Now Playing</a> song recognition tool.</p><p>Elsewhere, you can expect <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-emoji-update-170038659.html">redesigned emoji</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-3-update-available-today-scrolling-screenshot-170040876.html">scrolling screenshots</a> (which capture information from apps or web pages beyond what&#39;s on the screen), games you can play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-games-download-115553510.html">while they download</a>, a new one-handed mode and an accessibility option that lets people control the device <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-face-114800871.html">using face gestures</a>.</p><p>Although the Android 12 rollout is underway on Pixel, owners of compatible Samsung, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo and Xiaomi devices will need to wait a little longer. The OS will hit those phones and tablets, and ones from other companies, later this year. Google released Android 12 on the Android Open Source Project <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-android-open-source-project-173339442.html">earlier this month</a>.</p><p>There&#39;s another important thing to note about the Android 12 rollout. The dynamic color experience powered by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-material-you-android-personalized-redesign-182501466.html">Material You design language</a> is only available on Pixel devices for the time being. The color scheme will match the wallpaper you choose across the system and apps, and that look will be mirrored across other Google products, including smart displays, wearables, Chrome OS and the web. Google says other Android devices will get access to the experience later.</p><p><em>Catch up on all the latest news from </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Pixel%206%20event"><em>Google&#39;s Pixel 6 event</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-android-12-pixel-3-rollout-170031989.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8cb80285-8c00-43d5-9f70-e3a51ecb5386</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 17:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634663463</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T17:11:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/02d7d920-30ef-11ec-afe9-a15c4c7df19f" width="2097" height="1114" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/02d7d920-30ef-11ec-afe9-a15c4c7df19f" width="2097" height="1114" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Screenshots of various Android 12 features, including a privacy dashboard, quick controls and the option to share an approximate location with apps.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google's Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro deliver flagship features for $599 and $899]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in August, Google surprisingly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">announced its upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro smartphones</a> and said they would run on the company’s own “Tensor” mobile chip. We learned a few other things then and got a good look at the phones, as well, but today Google is finally officially revealing the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Pixel 6 and 6 Pro" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/n1E9N6">Pixel 6 and 6 Pro</a>.</p><p>Google tends to go back and forth with the Pixel lineup, alternating between phones with cutting edge features and prices to match and more mainstream, almost budget devices (last year’s Pixel 5 is a perfect example of the latter). Both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro feel like they’re designed to compete with Apple and Samsung’s best, but also at slightly more approachable prices — the Pixel 6 starts at $600 (with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage), while the Pixel 6 Pro starts at $900 (with 12GB of RAM and 128GB of storage). Notably, the $600 Pixel 6 is $100 cheaper than last year&#39;s Pixel 5, but it looks to be a far better phone, at least judging from the spec sheet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/e2055830-30f3-11ec-8ff7-c6914738a341" alt="Google Pixel 6" data-uuid="0810c264-3f0f-3342-81fd-e95317591eda"><figcaption>Google&#39;s Pixel 6</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The new Pixel 6 lineup looks unlike any previous phones Google made, thanks to the thick camera bar stretching across the back. The Pixel 6 has a dual-camera system, with wide and ultrawide lenses, while the Pixel 6 Pro adds a telephoto option. On both phones, the standard camera is a 50 megapixel sensor with a quad-bayer filter, which puts four pixels behind each standard color block — effectively, you’re not going to get 50-megapixel photos here, but something more in the realm of 12.5 megapixels.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ffd63fa0-30f3-11ec-bebd-863847ec2a58" alt="Google Pixel 6 Pro" data-uuid="055df325-1328-3c19-acd1-086669720e9c"><figcaption>And the Pixel 6 Pro.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Despite the fact that this is a 50 megapixel sensor, these pixels are pretty large, and the sensor is pretty big, too. Putting this all together means the Pixel 6’s main camera is gathering more light info per pixel, which should give it better clarity. Combined with that large sensor and large pixels, we’re expecting to see some impressive results here. Indeed, Google says that this allows its “super res zoom” feature to go in up to 7x the standard field of view; we’ll have to wait and see how those results look, but it’s an intriguing camera setup nonetheless.</p><p>The second ultrawide camera is a more traditional 12-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 aperture and a 114-degree field of view. Finally, the Pixel 6 Pro adds another impressive camera, a 48-megapixel shooter with 4x optical zoom. Given all the camera tech on board here, it’s not surprising that the camera bar on these phones is so large — once we get into our review, we can see if all this translates into quality photos, but Google’s track record here is pretty solid.</p><p>As for video capabilities, the rear camera array can record both 1080p and 4K video at 30 or 60 FPS, with other features like cinematic panning, slow-motion, timelapse, astrophotography timelapse and optical image stabilization on board. As with Apple’s iPhone 13, it’s safe to say that the video features Google loaded into the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro far exceed what most people need.</p><p>The front-facing cameras are different between the two new phones. The Pixel 6 has to make do with an 8-megapixel shooter with an f/2.0 aperture, while the Pixel 6 Pro has an 11.1-megapixel camera with larger pixels but a slightly smaller f/2.2 aperture. That camera lives in a small pinhole cut-out right in the center of the display. Rather than using that camera to unlock the phone, Google has equipped the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro with an under-screen thumbprint sensor, a first for the Pixel series.</p><p>While these cameras are definitely intriguing, the most notable thing about the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro is the Google-made Tensor processor. The company says it’s 80 percent faster than the Pixel 5, and it also provides on-device AI for things like faster and more accurate speech recognition as well as image processing. You can read <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-soc-pixel-6-chip-142256877.html">all about Tensor here</a>, but here&#39;s a quick breakdown. It&#39;s an eight-core chip, starting with two ARM Cortex-X1 cores running at 2.8GHz. It also includes two Cortex A76 cores running at 2.25GHz, and finally four 1.8GHz A55 cores. Those last four are the &quot;small&quot; cores, which are meant for efficiency, and as you step up the ladder you&#39;re getting more and more power. We <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-tensor-faq-specs-ai-ml-160021397.html">talked to Google about Tensor in August</a> and they said similar things then, but it’s another thing we’ll need to watch for in our review and see how Tensor stacks up to Qualcomm’s processors.</p><p>The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro come in one size each. The Pixel 6 is the smaller phone, with a 6.1-inch display, while the Pro counters with a 6.7-inch screen. The Pixel 6 has a 1,080 x 2,400 OLED, which works out to 411 pixels per inch; the 6 Pro’s screen is even more pixel-dense at 1,440 x 3,120, which works out to 512 pixels per inch. Both have high refresh rates, with the Pro going up to 120Hz. The Pixel 6 tops out at 90Hz, unfortunately, the same as the Pixel 5’s refresh rate.</p><p>As we’ve seen in the earlier photos Google released, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro each come in three different colors. Both phones are available in the monochromatic “Stormy Black,” while the Pixel 6 also comes in “Sorta Seafoam” and “Kinda Coral.” The Pixel 6 Pro’s options are a bit more demure; besides black you can choose “Cloudy White” and “Sorta Sunny,” which you could just as easily call silver and gold.</p><p>Battery is among the most important factors in a smartphone, and Google is once again promising more than 24 hours of usage, even when the phone is connected to 5G networks. The Pixel 6 has a 4,614 mAh battery, and the 6 pro has a 5,003 mAh battery, both larger than the one found in last year’s Pixel 5. Given that the Pixel 5 managed to last as long as Google promised, we’re expecting these phones should last that day-plus as well, though we’re definitely curious to see how the Tensor processor might play into things this year.</p><p>After the rather lackluster Pixel 5, it’s pretty clear Google has re-dedicated itself to the smartphone game with the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro. The spec list, cameras, battery life, design and — of course — the Tensor processor all seem set to impress. But as usual, we’ll have to run these phones through a review to say whether Google has a high-end hit on its hands.

At the time, the company promised it would have more to say about the subject, and now it has. On late Monday evening, the company took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/qb1ayt/darkplates_are_back_checkmate_lawyers/">Reddit</a> to announce a second version of the faceplates it says Sony won&#39;t have a legal case against.</p><p>“By creating a brand new design, Darkplates 2.0 successfully closes the loop on this dispute and neutralizes any future infringement claims from Sony,” the company said. It also claims its plates will make your PS5 look “considerably less ugly.” You can be the judge of that last one.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to a new design, the panels feature cutouts for the PS5’s 120mm intake fans. Citing data from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmggkW6usmQ">Gamers Nexus</a>, Dbrand claims its new plates will maximize your PS5’s thermal performance without the need to run it naked. Sony’s latest console doesn’t have overheating issues. That’s true of both the launch variant and the new revised model that comes with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps-5-cfi-1100-digital-foundry-analysis-204522648.html">smaller and lighter heatsink</a>. That said, running components at lower temperatures generally extends their lifespan over pushing them to the limit.  If you’re worried about dust making its way into your console, each set of Darkplates comes with a pair of mesh dust filters you can mount inside of the panels.</p><p>The new panels are available to pre-order starting today for an introductory price of $59.05 for the set. You can choose from three colors: matte black, retro gray and classic white. Alongside the faceplates, Dbrand is selling lightstrips you can use to tint your PS5’s side LEDs. They’re available in nine different colors, with a single one priced at $5.95. Dbrand will release the panels in waves, with the first, sold-out set shipping in November, and then the second and third waves following in December and January.</p><p>We wouldn’t necessarily count on plates making those dates. Dbrand says Sony will “probably” sue it again. It’s bullish on its prospects, but then again, it’s up against a much larger company.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dbrand-darkplates-2-0-162306317.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">18a490a2-0adf-4007-83a5-ecbef2551cb9</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 16:23:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634660653</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T16:24:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9f48d000-30f6-11ec-979f-021d5853cc16" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9f48d000-30f6-11ec-979f-021d5853cc16" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dbrand]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dbrand Darkplates 2.0]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dbrand Darkplates 2.0]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch Google's Pixel 6 event with us here at 1PM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-to-expect-google-pixel-6-event-130025254.html">Google&#39;s Pixel 6</a> is almost here after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">months of hype</a>.

As of today (October 19th), <a href="https://brave.com/download/">Brave</a> will use the engine as its browser&#39;s default search tool, replacing Google in the US, UK and Canada. It&#39;ll also supplant <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-05-duckduckgo-tracker-radar-web-tracking.html">DuckDuckGo</a> in Germany and Qwant in France, with more countries seeing the switch in the &quot;next several months.&quot;</p><p>Your browser will keep its existing search engine settings, and you can always pick Google or another competitor if you&#39;re so inclined.

Brave has <a href="https://brave.com/privacy/browser/#web-discovery-project">launched</a> a Web Discovery Project that lets volunteers contribute data to improve Brave Search&#39;s overall quality. The feature is anonymous and makes the data &quot;unlinkable,&quot; rendering it useless to ad customers or hackers. It runs automatically as you browse. The opt-in nature will limit WDP&#39;s usefulness, but Brave is clearly hoping to find enough participants that it narrows gaps with heavyweight rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/brave-browser-search-engine-default-160039239.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2f071a04-7574-4503-9cd4-231b99bc1fee</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 16:00:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634656710</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T15:18:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Internet & Networking Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bdb82d40-30e9-11ec-bf6d-21205b7e2586" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bdb82d40-30e9-11ec-bf6d-21205b7e2586" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brave]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Brave browser using in-house search engine as default]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Brave browser using in-house search engine as default ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram will finally let you create posts on the desktop]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It took years, but Instagram will finally let you create posts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-tests-desktop-posting-162209909.html">from the desktop web</a>. The social network is issuing a flurry of updates that will culminate on October 21st, when users worldwide will have the option of posting photos and short videos (under one minute) from their computer browser. That&#39;s helpful if you&#39;d rather not reach for your phone, of course, but it could be particularly useful for businesses and enthusiasts that want to make better use of their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7s-iii-mirrorless-camera-review-140041536.html">expensive cameras</a>.</p><p>There are plenty of updates for mobile users, too. A Collabs test feature available today (October 19th) lets two people co-author posts and Reels. You just have to invite someone else from the tagging screen to get them involved. Followers for both users will see the post, and it&#39;ll even share views, likes and comments. It&#39;s safe to say this could be valuable for everything from superstar team-ups to sponsored posts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another test coming on October 20th will let you start nonprofit fundraisers right from the new post button, simplifying charity efforts. Everyone will see new music-driven Reels effects on October 21st, including Superbeat (special effects in sync with the beat) and Dynamic Lyrics (3D lyrics that flow with the track). They&#39;re not as flashy as the other additions, but they may help you focus on sharing content rather than editing it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-desktop-web-post-creation-and-collabs-150032945.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7fad1fe3-197f-4550-a173-62a7e37aef93</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 15:00:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634652882</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T14:14:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ae392170-30e0-11ec-bdbf-14e0acba1750" width="1920" height="1150" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ae392170-30e0-11ec-bdbf-14e0acba1750" width="1920" height="1150" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram post creation on desktop web]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram post creation on desktop web]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon Music's spatial audio now works on any headphones]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&#39;ll be easier for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon%20music%20unlimited"><ins>Amazon Music Unlimited</ins></a> subscribers to listen to music with spatial audio starting today.

Plus, it’s the only smart display that works with Messenger and Whatsapp, two of the most popular chat platforms in the world (with added support for platforms like Zoom last year). This year, Facebook is introducing a portable version called the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Portal Go" href="https://fave.co/3BRmo5r">Portal Go</a>, that you can drag around the house to make calls from any room.</p><p>That portability combined with a few software updates make the $199 Portal Go an improvement over its predecessor, but it still doesn’t have the same breadth of features as Google’s or Amazon’s smart displays. And, as with all things Facebook, it all comes down to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-said-should-change-143051354.html">whether you trust the company with your data</a> in the first place.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h3>Hardware</h3><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="41111047-cfec-4b76-9dfe-a0d1983cf1af"/><p>The Portal Go has a softer aesthetic than previous models, with a grey fabric enclosure that’s similar to Google’s Nest Hub. It has rounded corners and almost looks like the display has been stitched onto a pillow (albeit a not very plush one). All of these curves make the Go pleasant to hold or to prop up on your lap, which is important for a device that’s meant to be portable.</p><p>Along the top of the Go are the volume controls and a button that disables both the camera and the microphone; The status light will turn red when that happens. If you want to leave the microphone on but not the camera, you can slide a built-in cover over the lens. This way, you can still use voice commands and make calls without worrying that anyone is watching you.</p><p>On the front is a 10.1-inch display with the same 1,280 x 800 resolution as previous Portals, but that’s not a bad thing. It’s crisp, colorful and the viewing angles are great. It has the same adaptive lighting features too: Automatic screen brightness, color adjustment and a Night Mode that reduces the amount of blue light in the evening.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/bb18e100-308b-11ec-9d7a-fe983f74b9a4" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="60df7fe8-0607-37ac-9dcf-3f42466097be"><figcaption>Facebook Portal Go</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The main difference between the Portal Go and its predecessors is that it doesn’t need to be plugged in all the time. Thanks to its  integrated handle and light weight, it’s easy to tote around with one hand. When it’s time to charge it, the device fits neatly into a proprietary 3-pin charging dock, too.</p><p>According to Facebook, the Portal Go will get up to five hours of Messenger calling on a charge, and up to 14 hours of music playback if the screen is off. But I actually managed to get six hours and five minutes of calling out of it before having to stick it back on the charging dock.</p><p>One of the benefits of the Go’s portability is that it is now effectively a portable speaker as well. The audio quality is pretty decent too, thanks to its two full-range speakers and subwoofer. The bass was relatively deep considering its size and the highs were clear. It’s not as good as the audio from my Sonos One of course, but it’ll do in a pinch.</p><h3>Video calls</h3><h3></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/d5a01bb0-308b-11ec-bbfa-1a062042c366" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="2fd6b64b-4620-30f2-80d3-e411ac801547"><figcaption>Facebook Portal Go</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>It should go without saying that, like all Portal devices, the Go requires a Facebook account. (How else is it supposed to make Messenger calls?) You can choose to integrate your WhatsApp or Workplace account as well.</p><p>Basically, the Go is a smart display that’s meant to be as easy to tote around as a tablet. You can keep it docked in your office for most of the day, for example, but when it comes time to chat with grandma, you can carry it to whichever room the kids are in. I don’t have any kids, but I liked being able to set it up wherever the best lighting was at various times of day for calls.</p><p>The Go has a 12-megapixel wide-angle lens coupled with AI-powered tech that will automatically pan and zoom to keep you in frame. Instead of crowding over an iPad, for example, you could just place the Go on a coffee table and get the whole family on the call. You can also double tap on someone’s face to “Spotlight” and keep the focus on them. I was impressed with how well it was able to “follow” me around the room, keeping me in frame as I wandered from my desk to my couch.</p><p>This automatic panning and zooming doesn’t just work in Messenger and WhatsApp, but also third-party video applications like Zoom and GoToMeeting. I should say, however, that this face-tracking technology also exists in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">Nest Hub Max</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-8-5-2021-review-180010029.html">Echo Show 8</a>, and they too have Zoom integration. However, only the Portals have Messenger and WhatsApp.</p><p>I was quite pleased with the video quality overall. I did notice occasional latency issues, but it wasn’t that bad. The Portal Go was able to handle different lighting conditions too; The colors were great even in relatively dim lighting. I did notice that calls in WhatsApp were a bit more pixelated than Messenger, but according to Facebook, that could be a bandwidth issue as they’re separate networks.</p><p>Facebook has also updated the Watch Together experience so it can be used not just on Portal-to-Portal calls, but also with Messenger contacts on other devices. It was a blast laughing over videos like 5-minute Crafts on calls with my friends. My main criticism is that we could only Watch Together clips that are on Facebook Watch. Portal devices unfortunately lack support for YouTube, which is a much more diverse source of video content.</p><p>Like previous Portals, the Go has AR features such as StoryTime, which is an AR storytelling experience, and PlayTime, which is an assortment of AR games. These are fun, but they’re the sort of thing you try once and never again.</p><h3>Interface</h3><h3></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/083ca6b0-308c-11ec-b3f7-c8a18df25a5c" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="65199236-8061-371d-be84-c3641ea350fa"><figcaption>Facebook Portal Go</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The whole Portal family got an update recently with a new, more personalized home screen. There’s a top row of favorite contacts that you can customize, and you’ll also see call notifications here.</p><p>Underneath the favorite contacts is an array of cards that lead to different apps, depending on what you have installed. I found the calendar card particularly useful, which not only shows upcoming events with handy links to join Zoom chats where relevant.</p><p>The Portal Go can be used by the whole family, but you might not trust everyone to use the device responsibly. That’s why Facebook introduced Household Mode, which restricts what users can do while it is enabled. For example, you can set it so that the Portal can only be used for Messenger calls to grandma and grandpa. You can then disable Household Mode to regain full control of the device.</p><p>By default, the Portal Go’s home screen will show stock art, but you can also customize it with a Digital Photo Frame app. When you tap the Apps button on the home screen, you’ll see an array of pre-installed apps like Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, Photo Booth, a browser, Facebook Live and Facebook Watch, and more are available for download.</p><p>As with previous Portals, the Go supports Alexa and the Facebook Assistant, which you summon by saying “Hey, Portal”. You can ask the Facebook Assistant to make Messenger and WhatsApp calls, play music, check the weather, create timers and launch apps. I also occasionally used it to change the voice options for different AR effects.</p><p>Alexa, on the other hand, is more for hearing the latest news or sports scores, building a shopping list and managing your smart home devices, which the Portal assistant can’t do.</p><p>Of course, with any Facebook product, privacy and security are obvious concerns, given the company’s terrible reputation. It said the AI-powered panning and zooming are processed locally on the device. Additionally, all WhatsApp calls are end-to-end encrypted by default. Messenger calls however, are not, and you’ll have to specify which contacts or groups you want to enable it with. Even then, encryption is still in the roll-out phase; I don’t currently have it.</p><h3>Competition</h3><h3></h3><p>While the Portal Go excels at video calls, it still lags behind the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Echo Show 8" href="https://amzn.to/2XrVsdF">Amazon Echo Show 8</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Google Nest Hub Max" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/15PEQR">Google Nest Hub Max</a> in basically every other department. Facebook doesn’t offer any streaming video options aside from its own, which means no Hulu, Netflix or YouTube. Plus, smart home features are buried in the Portal Go, while they’re front and center on the other devices.</p><p>To make matters worse, the Nest Hub Max and the Echo Show 8 have similar smart camera technology to the Portal Go, so that’s not a unique advantage for Facebook. And the $199 Go is even more expensive than the $130 Echo Show 8. (Though the Nest Hub Max is $229.) The Portal Go is the only one that’s battery-powered, however, while the other smart displays are stuck wherever you plug them in.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><h3></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/54fdb2f0-308c-11ec-a75f-971bbc2a307c" alt="Facebook Portal Go" data-uuid="69f00563-9136-3898-a7fb-681e21a2be29"><figcaption>Facebook Portal Go</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>The primary advantages that the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Go" href="https://fave.co/3BRmo5r">Go</a> has over other smart displays is its portability and Messenger and WhatsApp support. But both Google and Amazon make better devices with way more features. On top of that, Facebook’s poor reputation on privacy gives us pause on recommending it. You should only choose the Portal Go if Messenger and WhatsApp are the two video call services you use.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-portal-go-review-140033819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a3ea2e36-91c0-4f85-979a-177a0092d646</guid><dc:creator>Nicole Lee</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 14:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634661219</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T16:37:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nicole Lee]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/83341a20-308b-11ec-bdfd-7a74ae2a71f7" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/83341a20-308b-11ec-bdfd-7a74ae2a71f7" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Portal Go]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Portal Go]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Galaxy Watch 4 drops to new low of $220 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung&#39;s latest smartwatches are only a few months old but they&#39;ve just received their first discount on Amazon.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">Galaxy Watch 4 series</a> keeps this pattern going and they are the first devices to use the new Wear OS and One UI developed by Samsung and Google&#39;s new partnership. Tizen faithfuls will know their way around the UI — thankfully, the team decided to follow Samsung&#39;s lead in this case, adding only useful features into the mix like the ability to download Play Store apps directly to your wrist. You&#39;re also able to use gesture controls to do things like answer a call with a flick of your wrist.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Galaxy Watch 4 models are also solid fitness trackers. Inside is a new three-in-one biometric sensor that&#39;s faster and gives more accurate readings than those in previous models. It also helps enable things like bioelectrical impedance analysis for body mass scans. The Galaxy Watch 4 can also take blood oxygen readings, track sleep, detect if you&#39;re snoring at night and track 95 different workouts. If you&#39;re already an active person or are looking to get more active, chances are you&#39;ll be able to monitor all of your favorite exercises and more with this wearable.</p><p>On top of all that, the Galaxy Watch 4 models look pretty nice, too. The Watch 4 Classic has a physical rotating bezel and a stainless steel case, but otherwise it&#39;s the same as the standard Watch 4. Their screens are crisp and bright, and they&#39;re generally comfortable to wear all day long. General performance is good as well, although battery life could be better at just about one day. If you have an Android user — or a Samsung fan — in your life, the Galaxy Watch 4 would make a good gift this holiday season.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-drops-to-new-low-of-220-at-amazon-131549119.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">42b5cf58-ba1d-439c-bf24-9a3ebbe8e5b9</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:15:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634648821</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T13:07:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4bc24470-0509-11ec-94e9-ed0b3ea276d8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4bc24470-0509-11ec-94e9-ed0b3ea276d8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A black Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 on a wrist]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[iMovie for macOS Monterey can edit iPhone 13 Cinematic Mode videos]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You don&#39;t need <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-final-cut-pro-logic-pro-m1-pro-max-update-183550958.html">pro editing software</a> to work with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-and-13-mini-review-130035113.html">iPhone 13&#39;s</a> Cinematic Mode video on your Mac. <em>AppleInsider</em><a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/10/19/apple-updates-imovie-for-mac-with-cinematic-mode-support-more">notes</a> Apple has <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/imovie/id408981434">updated</a> iMovie for Mac to enable editing for Cinematic Mode footage.

You can add those effects to images or video, with the result being shareable musical &quot;selfies&quot; or videos that sync with whatever loops or music you&#39;re playing on Orba.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="f65f0d80e5904f3e9cd22082e07d9da1"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/raaGiRX2I8s?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>You can jump between Drum, Bass, Chord and Lead Modes, and the sounds and visual effects are built into the video export, &quot;no audio routing or post-production required.&quot; You can also sing or rap into your phone&#39;s microphone, shoot video while you play live, or important camera roll videos or photos.&nbsp;</p><p>The company notes that the app makes it possible to marry sound and video, but rather than just &quot;pasting someone else&#39;s song on your video... people can create musical videos that are entirely their own.&quot; The app is now available as a <a href="https://artiphon.com/pages/downloads">free download</a> for Orba users.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/orbacam-i-os-app-for-the-orba-instrument-lets-you-create-musical-selfies-130046918.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60578c24-0937-4bd5-8220-830450fffbc5</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:00:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634654255</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T14:37:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9b65e060-30bd-11ec-b97b-d09efa7c7d9c" width="1410" height="906" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9b65e060-30bd-11ec-b97b-d09efa7c7d9c" width="1410" height="906" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Artiphon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Orbacam iOS app for the Orba musical instrument]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Orbacam iOS app for the Orba musical instrument]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi's Build HAT helps students build LEGO robots]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/raspberry-pi-400-diy-maker-computer-080002292.html">Raspberry Pi</a> has launched a new product that would make it easier to build robots out of LEGO components. The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-build-hat-lego-education/">Build HAT</a> (or Hardware Attached on Top), as it is called, is an add-on device that plugs into the Pi&#39;s 40-pin GPIO header. It was specifically designed to make it easy to use Pi hardware to control up to four LEGO Technic motors and sensors from the the toy company&#39;s Education Spike kits. Those sets are meant as a STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, the Arts and Mathematics) learning tool for young students. The HAT also works with motors and sensors from the Mindstorms Robot Inventor kit.</p><p>In addition to the Build HAT itself, the company has created a <a href="https://buildhat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Python library</a> that can help students build prototypes using a Raspberry Pi and LEGO components. Plus, Raspberry Pi designed a $15 power supply for the HAT that can also power the motors and sensors attached to it. The Build HAT will set buyers back $25 each, and it works with all 40-pin GPIO Raspberry Pi boards, including the Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi Zero.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Those who want to make sure that their LEGO components will work with the HAT can also check out Raspberry Pi&#39;s handy <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/accessories/build-hat.html#device-compatibility">list of compatible components</a>. Finally, those who need a bit of help to get started can try follow one of Pi&#39;s project guides, which include a <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-game-controller">DIY game controller</a>, a <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-robot-car">robot buggy</a> that can be controlled via Bluetooth and a <a href="https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-robot-face">robotic face</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/raspberry-pi-build-hat-lego-robots-123039227.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7d073afd-12c8-41d2-b948-7d6acf7275d1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 19 Oct 2021 12:30:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634645400</ingested><modified>2021-10-19T12:10:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/968edf10-30cc-11ec-9fd0-de59a72aacc0" width="1536" height="996" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/968edf10-30cc-11ec-9fd0-de59a72aacc0" width="1536" height="996" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The top tech deals in Best Buy's early Black Friday sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Given all the talk of supply chain issues this year, it&#39;s no surprise that we&#39;re starting to see early Black Friday sales hit the internet before November 1.

It should be less clunky than the current system of direct sharing from the console.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of screenshots taken from the Create Menu or Create button shortcuts, you can share gameplay videos under three minutes in length up to 1080p (not 4K). For screenshots and videos to be auto-uploaded, make sure you&#39;ve linked your PS5 console to the PlayStation app. It also needs to be left in rest mode and have the &quot;Stay Connected to the Internet&quot; setting enabled.

As expected, its high-end laptops were the star of its Unleashed event yesterday and are the first machines powered by Apple’s new M1 Pro and M1 Max chips. (The company is borrowing iPhone nomenclature, it seems.)</p><p>It’s been hard for me to get too excited about the MacBook Pro’s slow, cautious evolution over the last few years. The OLED Touch Bar was a misstep, nixing function keys for a light-up bar with customizable touch panels. There were fewer ports than older models, including the SD card slot. This added another dongle to my bag, alongside a USB-C converter for any devices that hadn’t caught up with the MacBook’s own USB-C ports — which were few and far between. And don’t get me started on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-23-apple-macbook-keyboard-next-day-repairs-in-store.html"><ins>&quot;butterfly&quot; style keyboard </ins></a>that appeared in 2015.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-2021-update-price-specs-release-date-173447695.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ca2dc640-30c9-11ec-bf7d-59022bb1283a" style="height:422;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="423853ea-64c6-3d13-a4ba-69f42a2f5d6f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure></a><p>The 2021 MacBook Pro literally brushes away most of my problems. Yes, there’s an SD card reader, more ports, no more Touch Bar to accidentally hit and close internet tabs, more ports and a blast from the past.</p><p>Yep, MagSafe is back. While the term returned on recent iPhones, it’s been years since Apple offered the magnetic cable safety feature on its computers. It’s different from the old connector, and, in worst case scenarios, you can still charge through USB-C.</p><p>The screens have been expanded, featuring micro-LED display tech first used on iPad Pro and also marking the first appearance of a notch on MacBooks. Long live the notch!</p><p>These machines are for power users — and Apple is seriously talking up the capabilities of its new chips, more on that below. But that’s not what intrigues me. It’s the fact that Apple is walking back some of its pretty major missteps in recent MacBook Pro history and making it more usable in the process, tempting me to buy myself a new MacBook for the first time in a decade.</p><p>The 14-inch base model and 16-inch base model are set to start at $1,999 and $2,499 respectively.

As we saw in our review of the latest MacBook Air, MacBook Pro and colorful iMac, the M1 was a marvel, if not quite the pro-level of power many might have been expecting.</p><p>With the M1 Pro and M1 Max, the two chips underpinning the company&#39;s new 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros, it’s making a renewed pitch for power users. Both chips have 5nm 10-core processors, with eight high-performance cores and two high-efficiency units. Apple says the chips offer up to 1.7X faster performance than competing eight-core PC chips, which makes them particularly compelling for people doing heavy-duty 3D and video rendering.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-m1-pro-m1-max-chips-macbook-pro-172415918.html"><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-marvel-cinematic-universe-indiana-jones-delay-disney-plus-190758945.html">Disney delays all of Marvel’s 2022 films</a></h2><h2>At least three major movies will all hit Disney+ later as a result.</h2><h3></h3><p>Disney has shaken up its movie release calendar, with several Marvel Cinematic Universe flicks delayed.

But to be able to train its technology further, it has to hold trials in other locations with different environmental conditions — like Seattle.

Zoox built special hardware into its sensors to give its vehicles the capability to automatically remove water and debris when needed. The Seattle trial will help it validate whether its system and new hardware will work as intended. At the beginning of its trial, the company will deploy a small fleet of L3 vehicles to assess the demands of the Seattle area, including its narrow tunnels and one-way roads, before expanding its tests.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zoox <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoox-amazon-autonomous-robotaxi-153756758.html">introduced</a> a fully autonomous robotaxi last year, which is a tiny four-wheeled bi-directional vehicle without a steering wheel. Its existing L3 vehicles, however, are Toyota Highlanders outfitted with Zoox&#39;s sensors and powered by its autonomous driving software with a human driver behind the wheel.
