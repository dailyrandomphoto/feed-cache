To start with, the Standard Range model, with a projected 230 miles of range, will come with a 98 kWh battery pack. Meanwhile, the optional Extended Range version (300 miles targeted) will have a massive 131 kWh battery.&nbsp;</p><p>The Standard Range package will be the main offering on the first three of four versions: the fleet-oriented Lightning Pro, the XLT and the Lariat. The Extended Range is optional for the XLT and Lariat, and standard on the top-end Platinum model. Ford said that the &quot;F-150 Lighting Pro model will be available with the standard-range battery to retail customers,&quot; but it <a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/05/24/all-electric-f-150-lightning-pro.html">previously said</a> that it would be available with the Extended Range option for fleet buyers.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ford also revealed that the power fold mirrors would only be available on the Lariat and Platinum models, and that the Tough Bed spray-in bed liner is not standard, but an available option on all trims. Other options we already knew about include a high-powered 9.6 kW Pro Power system for the first two trims (it&#39;s standard on Lariat and Platinum) and 15.5-inch touchscreen with Sync 4A, available on the upper trim levels.</p><p>Ford has yet to reveal exact retail prices, but it previously said that the Standard Range Lightning Pro will start at $39,974 before any tax incentives for commercial buyers, while the Extended Range model (again only for fleet buyers) will start at $49,974. Retail prices are expected to start at $42,000 and top out at $90,000 for the Platinum model. That&#39;s a fair bit higher than the $28,000 base price for an F-150 ICE version, but then again, most folks pay <a href="https://www.kbb.com/reviews/pricing-your-next-ford-f-150-it-could-cost-60000-or-more/">considerably more than that</a> on average.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the large battery sizes, Ford&#39;s prices actually seem surprisingly reasonable. By comparison, Hyundai&#39;s <a href="https://www.hyundaiusa.com/us/en/vehicles/kona-electric">Kona Electric</a> has a much smaller 64 kWh battery and starts at $34,000. We should know the exact F-150 Lightning prices soon, as Ford said in the livestream that order banks would open in January 2022. Currently, it has 200,000 pre-orders in hand, and recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-stops-f-150-lightning-reservations-at-200000-192434385.html">cut off</a> further reservations.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ford-f-150-lightning-ev-pickup-98-kwh-131-kwh-batteries-092329022.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a1cc737b-5811-466d-b529-42da19288e19</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2021 09:23:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639992736</ingested><modified>2021-12-20T09:32:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b6f75c0-616f-11ec-8b7e-aba0cee9ea46" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/9b6f75c0-616f-11ec-8b7e-aba0cee9ea46" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ford's F-150 Lightning will come with 98 kWh and 131 kWh battery packs]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ford's F-150 Lightning will come with 98 kWh and 131 kWh battery packs]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Malaysia's updated copyright law imprisons streaming pirates for up to 20 years]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Illegal streaming could be particularly costly in Malaysia. <em>TorrentFreak</em><a href="https://torrentfreak.com/malaysia-passes-bill-to-imprison-illegal-streaming-pirates-for-up-to-20-years-211218/">reports</a> the country has passed <a href="https://www.lowyat.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Parlimen-CopyrightAct1987-ammendment-dec21-01.pdf">amendments</a> to its Copyright Act that punish those who enable pirate streaming.

The two have <a href="https://twitter.com/youtubetv/status/1472657141789904899?s=21">struck</a> a deal that restores access to ESPN, FX and other Disney channels on YouTube&#39;s streaming service. Local ABC stations will come back over the course of the day (December 19th), but you may already see access to any recordings of Disney-owned channels.</p><p>The base subscription rate is returning to $65 per month, but YouTube TV promised that &quot;all impacted members&quot; would still receive a one-off $15 discount. More details would be coming through email, the service said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Disney channels vanished on December 18th after the media giant and YouTube TV failed to reach an agreement on channel carriage fees. As is often the case with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-returns-to-dishs-lineup-after-protracted-dispute-is-resolved-061504019.html">disputes like this</a>, each side blamed the other. Disney claimed YouTube TV &quot;declined to reach a fair deal,&quot; while YouTube maintained that it was advocating on &quot;behalf&quot; of viewers.</p><p>This isn&#39;t YouTube TV&#39;s only row over carriage deals. The service has traded blows with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/you-tube-tv-nbc-universal-dispute-resolved-200510827.html">NBCUniversal</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-05-youtube-tv-fox-regional-sports-yes-network.html">Sinclair</a>, for instance. With that said, the Disney fight may have been one of its most important. It&#39;s not just that channels like ESPN remain a major draw for live TV services — it&#39;s that Disney could easily have siphoned some of those customers to its equivalent Hulu offering. YouTube may have decided that any increased costs (and possible rate hikes) were less painful than losing viewership.</p><div id="4f9cc4bef1df4c4782032a1364a55c90"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re happy to announce that we&#39;ve reached a deal with Disney and have already started to restore access to channels like ESPN and FX, and Disney recordings that were previously in your Library.

The principal investigator for NASA&#39;s Juno mission, Scott Bolton, has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html">produced</a> an audio recording of magnetic field activity around <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hubble-water-vapor-jupiter-ganymede-nasa-esa-184541367.html">Jupiter&#39;s moon Ganymede</a> as the Juno spacecraft flew past on June 7th, 2021. The 50-second clip reveals a sharp change in activity as the probe entered a different part of Ganymede&#39;s magnetosphere, possibly as it left the night side to enter the daylight.</p><p>The audio came from shifting electric and magnetic frequencies into the audible range. Jupiter&#39;s magnetosphere dominates that of its moons and is present in the recording, but Ganymede is the only moon in the Solar System to have a magnetic field (likely due to its liquid iron core). This isn&#39;t a feat you could replicate elsewhere in the near future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The soundtrack was part of a larger Juno briefing where the mission team revealed the most detailed map yet of Jupiter&#39;s magnetic field. The data showed how long it would take the Great Red Spot and the equatorial Great Blue Spot to move around the planet (roughly 4.5 years and 350 years respectively).

It starts at RMB 328,000 (about $51,450), or well under the roughly $70,000 of the ET7, but offers similarly grandiose range figures. Nio claims the base 75kWh battery offers over 341 miles of range using China&#39;s test cycle, while the highest-end 150kWh &quot;Ultralong Range&quot; pack is supposedly good for more than 620 miles. You&#39;ll likely pay significantly more for the privilege and may not see that range in real life, but the numbers could still tempt you away from higher-end Model 3s if long-distance driving is crucial.</p><p>You can expect the usual heapings of technology. The ET5 will have built-in support for autonomous driving features as they&#39;re approved, and drivers get a &quot;digital cockpit&quot; thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nreal-light-mixed-reality-glasses-us-verizon-140017764.html">Nreal</a>-developed augmented reality glasses that can project a virtual screen equivalent to 201 inches at a 20-foot viewing distance.

That&#39;s a long way off, but Nio appears to be on track with its EV plans as it expects to deliver the ET7 on time (if only just) starting March 28th.</p><p>This launch also dovetails with Nio&#39;s tentative steps outside of China. The brand only expanded to Norway in 2021, but it aimed to begin sales in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden in 2022. You should see the badge in 25 countries and regions by 2025. While Nio still won&#39;t count as automotive heavyweight by that stage, it could easily put pressure on other EV makers within a few years.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nio-et5-ev-190702131.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ba0272c7-e02c-40a6-9b5b-53327d2417c0</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 19:07:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639854425</ingested><modified>2021-12-18T19:07:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c47225e0-602e-11ec-bfeb-6df5188a862b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c47225e0-602e-11ec-bfeb-6df5188a862b" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nio]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nio ET5 EV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nio ET5 EV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New Toyota cars don't include remote starting on key fobs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Current Toyota drivers might not be thrilled about having to subscribe <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-key-fob-remote-start-function-requires-subscription-111606852.html">just to remotely start</a> from their key fobs, but what about new buyers?

And Billy Steele listened to Yahama’s YH-L700A, which he deemed a bit heavy-handed, albeit excellent for movie watching.</p><h2>The Yamaha YH-L700A headphones have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/yamaha-yh-l700a-review-130056716.html">a unique aesthetic and a high price</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a73df20-592e-11ec-8375-2a72806c444d" alt="Yamaha YH-L700A review" data-uuid="a74a6e50-f9ad-3c8b-95a6-9bffa0a47b49"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Billy Steele likes the look of the <a href="https://amzn.to/3F6mW96">Yamaha YH-L700A</a> headphones: he says the combination of leather, fabric, matte black and silver accents makes for a refined look while the square fold-in ear cups make them easy to travel with. The noteworthy feature on these headphones is the 3D Sound Field feature, which consists of seven presets to enhance music and movies. There’s also a head-tracking feature which makes the sound appear to be coming from a stationary point.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Billy says this last feature added a cinematic element to movie watching, but he didn’t think it translated when listening to music. The seven presets of the 3D Sound Field likewise worked better for movies and television where they created a spacious sound. While testing the filters with music, Billy reports they felt  heavy-handed and didn’t work well across genres. He says the active noise cancellation on these cans is sufficient if not impressive, and points out that the marquee features can be toggled on and off within the app. However, he was disappointed with the battery life – during testing, the headphones managed to last just under 11 hours, which is lackluster when most of the competition boasts closer to 30 hours of battery life. And at $500, they have a high price tag to boot.</p><h2>The Analogue Pocket offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/analogue-pocket-review-150056011.html">all the fun of ‘90s portable gaming</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5fc6b9e0-5f7e-11ec-bccb-885439fe0e1d" alt="Analogue Pocket" data-uuid="ecd007be-d945-3497-90d7-0621f0a9cee2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew/Engadget</div></figure><p>James Trew is a long-time vintage gaming fan and is quick to point out that while the <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket">Analogue Pocket</a> is the best experience available right now, it’s also not for casual users. At $220, it lets you play most vintage portable titles from Game Boy, as well as Game Gear, while adapters for Neo Geo Pocket Color and Atari Lynx are on the way. It also has more modern touches, too, like a backlit display. And in addition to being a quality gaming device, the Analogue Pocket can also hook up to a TV and has built-in music making software.</p><p>Because of its FPGA “cores,” the Pocket can mimic vintage consoles at a hardware level – no more emulator quirks to suffer through. It’s also functional with original Game Boy accessories like the Game Boy Camera, printers or rumble packs. And it can connect to an authentic Game Boy for a multiplayer experience. James liked the 3.5-inch screen made with Gorilla Glass as well as the save states, but wished the shoulder buttons were better and said some of the display modes obscure on-screen messaging at times. Overall, the Analogue Pocket offers elevated retro gameplay with enough forthcoming additional features to ensure it will get better over time.</p><h2><em>Halo: Infinite </em>has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-review-campaign-xbox-microsoft-080158610.html">fun new mechanics and tools</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8e4d2060-5f7e-11ec-8625-35a59187b28e" alt="Halo: Infinite" data-uuid="ffbcc3f9-0632-3493-80a5-cfc635241b40"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Engadget</div></figure><p>Jessica Conditt had high hopes for <a href="https://amzn.to/3sgVF0k"><em>Halo: Infinite</em></a><em>, </em>the first open-world game in the franchise’s history. And she admits that playing the new storyline brought back warm, gleeful feelings and a sense of familiarity. However, she also thinks the game lacks surprise and intrigue – much of the innovation into vertical space has been done by other, more recent games, and the cramped map made for contained and linear gameplay.</p><p>That being said, Jessica reports she had a lot of fun playing with the newly available mechanics and tools, in particular the grapple hook. From climbing mountains to scaling buildings, the grapple hook provides new vertical space for players to explore. Jessica says that while she expected a lot more from the pioneer FPS title, she also thinks it’s at its best when it gives users a rich environment full of grappling, shielding and in-air headshots. From the maze-like levels, military stereotypes and sarcastic robots, <em>Infinite </em>plays like a classic Halo game.</p><h2>The Hydrasynth Explorer offers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hydrasynth-explorer-review-wavetable-synthesis-183026724.html">an endless array of synth options</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/c5da5160-5f7e-11ec-af4f-5fa3df46f039" alt="Hydrasynth Explorer" data-uuid="5e6b7073-336d-3036-be27-904697348370"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien admits up front that the <a href="https://fave.co/3GPVgG7">Hydrasynth Explorer</a> offers a remarkable array of features and options in a portable, well-built device. For $600, you get a wavemorphing engine with an eight-note polyphone, three oscillators per voice, a ring modulator, a noise source and over 200 waveforms. There are also two filters which can be in series or parallel to determine how much of each oscillator goes to each filter. He says that the 88-page manual feels like it’s just skimming the surface of what the synth is capable of.</p><p>However, you don’t need to master the sound design tools to get started with the instrument – just dig into the 640 presets spread over five banks of 128 patches. During testing, Terrence found the Explorer easy to use thanks to the neatly labeled sections on the front panel. A few things missing on the versatile device are a proper sequencer, full-sized keys, and touch strips instead of pitch and mod wheels. There are also only three filter knobs instead of five. Despite that, Terrence still feels that the Explorer is well worth its price tag given its great sound, solid build and plethora of tools to explore.</p><h2>Fender’s Acoustasonic Player Telecaster is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fender-acoustasonic-player-telecaster-hybrid-guitar-hands-on-183045383.html">an (almost) perfect couch guitar</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/f7a4bf50-5f7e-11ec-8ffd-c0f7b9b11aad" alt="Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster" data-uuid="bd87987e-c5b9-3ff0-bde3-4660d3b7cf47"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien also spent some time with the new <a href="https://fave.co/323YExL">Fender Acoustasonic Player Telecaster</a>, which slashes $800 off the price of the previous model. For $1,200, you get a mahogany and spruce satin finish with a rosewood fretboard, two pickups and a three-way switch with six sound options. Instead of a rechargeable battery, the Player runs on a standard nine-volt cell. Terrence reports it eats through the batteries surprisingly quickly, but remains convenient.</p><p>When it came to how the instrument sounded, Terrence reports that while there are fewer acoustic simulations on this model, the two offerings (Rosewood Dreadnought and Mahogany Small Body) cover a lot of ground. He says that he prefers the electric sounds of the Telecaster to the more expensive <a href="https://fave.co/32arOvl">Jazzmaster</a>, as it resembles the original guitar more and plays better with pedals. Terrence says the two acoustic simulations offer depth and character, and that overall, the hybrid guitar is a perfect couch instrument.</p><h2>Universal’s Audio Volt is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-audio-volt-2-volt-276-review-audio-interface-home-studio-170050385.html">an audio interface ideal for a home studio</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/27d4b720-5f7f-11ec-bbef-3371e2aa6829" alt="Universal Audio Volt" data-uuid="a4a21376-8a82-3c72-ac4a-0969366eb12c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien/Engadget</div></figure><p>Terrence O’Brien deems Universal Audio’s first foray into the budget space a success. The company’s <a href="https://fave.co/3q3MTQt">Volt series</a>, five models that run from $139 to $369, are affordable audio interfaces that share a core 24-bit/192kHz audio converter and a preamp with a “Vintage” mode that aims to recreate that classic tube preamp sounds. Terrence tested the $189 Volt 2 and the $299 Volt 276, which are both two-input interfaces.</p><p>The differences between the two models are slight: the Volt 2 is simple and utilitarian, but works well with limited space, while the “76” version has a built-in compressor and will require extra desk space as most of the controls are on the top. Terrence says the compressor makes a big difference as it’s capable of softer edges to tame the harsher frequencies. He also felt the metering LEDs on the 276 were easier to see and the wooden sides were a nice touch. While the base models were excellent interfaces at reasonable prices, Terrence said the 176, 276 and 476 stood out from the pack thanks to their compressors, style and ergonomics.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-listen-to-yamahas-latest-headphones-with-3d-sound-170015087.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60360933-ebcd-452d-881b-41b2e81f5631</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 17:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639783892</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T23:31:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/054c3080-5f7e-11ec-bbcb-78afb82f2968" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/054c3080-5f7e-11ec-bbcb-78afb82f2968" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ICYMI: We listen to Yamaha’s latest headphones with 3D sound]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Adidas' first NFT drop earns $23 million]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Adidas&#39; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/adidas-metaverse-nft-teaser-173817023.html">first NFT effort</a> appears to have been a success. <em>The Block</em> has <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/128003/adidas-originals-nets-23-million-after-closing-its-first-nft-drop">learned</a> the collaboration with Bored Ape Yacht Club, Gmoney and Punks has raked in more than $23 million in Ethereum between a $15.5 million &quot;Early Access&quot; phase and $7.5 million in a general sale.

In the excerpt below, Rose takes a look at two companies leveraging computer vision and generative adversarial networks to reimagine existing properties as 21st century electrified smart homes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/cfae0f40-59e0-11ec-9ddf-0394f646accf" alt="Supersight front cover" data-uuid="801f2f9c-a224-3d9f-8e5f-db9fb4165b6d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BenBella Books</div></figure><p><em>Excerpted with permission from </em><a href="https://www.supersight.world/">SuperSight: What Augmented Reality Means for Our Lives, Our Work, and the Way We Imagine the Future</a><em> by David Rose, published by BenBella Books.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><hr><p>We should all be using solar panels. Period. The average cost for a sustainable energy system has fallen about 70% in the last decade, from $5.86/watt to $1.50/ watt, so it’s a financial no-brainer. For no money down, you can finance an installation and start saving a hundred dollars a month in the first month, and even more if you live in the sun-saturated South.</p><p>So why aren’t we? It’s complicated! Math, logistics, taxes, and aesthetics all play a role. Many homeowners fear it will make their houses shiny and reflective like the Tin Man from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. The process of figuring out the number of panels in what size you need requires learning to “talk solar” in unfamiliar units like kilowatt-hours. And change always comes with risk, whether actual or just perceived.</p><p>The pro-climate mission of Boston-based company Energy Sage is to get people to electrify their homes. That means solar panels on your roof, an electric car, a home battery system, automatic blinds, and a smart thermostat that precools or preheats as you drive home. And they’ve partnered with us at Continuum to get potential customers more comfortable with the idea by showing them what an electrified version of their home might look like. Using publicly available Google Home satellite images, we size solar panels, digitally overlay them on clients’ roofs, and then show them what their pad would look like from both the street and their neighbor’s fence. We then take those images and pair them with data from Project Sunroof, a Google project that helps you work out the solar savings potential of your roof. Once you’ve seen the beautiful pictures of your electrified home and realized how much you’re going to save over the years—and you have the visual and financial data in hand—it’s a simple decision to go forward and make that change.</p><p>Other home improvement projects will benefit from a similar SuperSight-envisioned approach. Let’s consider landscaping: another complicated, potentially expensive project with its own disorienting language, risks, and desperate need for pre-project visualization.</p><p>I met landscape designer Julie Moir-Messervy at an MIT pitch competition and was immediately intrigued with her mission: to give homeowners the confidence and tools they need to change their barren yard into a collection of outdoor living spaces. Her company, HomeOutside, helps people see new possibilities for their backyards using AI and computer vision. Once they’ve visualized their yard in a compelling way, the company makes it easy for them to make that vision a reality by hiring the landscape installer, getting materials delivered, and even helping spread the payments out over time.</p><p>Landscaping isn’t just good for property values; greenscapes filter airborne pollutants that trigger asthma, help people recuperate faster from illness, reduce summer temperatures, and even lower crime. Proper native landscaping powers a dynamic system that helps out the bees and birds, who in turn pollinate trees and reseed plants. Southwest shade trees can reduce the need for air-conditioning, and northeast hedges cut down on winter winds—and heating bills. More trees mean more carbon capture—a ton over the lifetime of each tree—as they literally suck the bad stuff we produce out of the air while reducing runoff and erosion.</p><p>But “most people don’t do anything in their yards because they don’t know where to start,” Julie told me. “They don’t know which plants to select and how to arrange them, or don’t know how to install a landscape design and care for it over time.” I was so inspired to work on the problem that I accepted a position on her board and got to work.</p><p>HomeOutside is training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to automatically compose beautiful and sustainable landscape designs, based on the thousands of designs (think of these as recipes) the firm has developed for clients over the last twenty-plus years. The company uses Google Earth Engine and photogrammetry to start with a 3D view of any address (US only, currently). The GAN architecture then uses one network (the Generator) to make a new design, and another network (the Discriminator) to judge or score the work. These two networks continue their iterative game, generating then scoring, until the discriminator judges that the landscape has a good composition: shade trees, natural pollinators, grass for playing, hardscapes/decks and furniture for gathering places, plant diversity, and so forth.</p><p>Companies that sell plants, furniture, lighting, and hardscapes are obviously interested in this type of “imagination engine” technology, because it bridges the conceptual gap between the current state of someone’s garden and what could be—thus motivating many more people to make the dream real. It’s not just great for the homeowners and outdoor retailers, either—it’s great for the environment, too. But what the company’s environmentally focused investors find  most captivating about this project is the opportunity to change the landscape of entire neighborhoods at scale. <em>What if we could create a new national park across millions of backyards that stitch together places for birds and bees? </em>Every acre of forest absorbs about 2.5 tons of carbon a year. What if we turned neighborhoods into significant carbon sequestration zones?</p><p>I helped Julie and her team develop HomeOutside’s grand plan to proactively redesign seventy million front yards, then work with Home Depot, Lowe’s, Wayfair, IKEA, and garden centers to email their customers a 3D redesign of their yard. Customers simply go outside their home, open their phone, and,through the app’s use of spatial world anchors, walk through an immersive animated landscape superimposed on their current yard. A time-lapse view from sunrise to sunset shows why the edible garden is placed where it is. The winter visualization explains the choice of new fir trees between their yard and the neighbor’s. Spring flowers bloom with a cacophony of color.</p><p>Will people be alarmed by the idea of an algorithm proactively redesigning their yard, with new shade trees and naturally pollinating shrubs? It’s not as if your front yard is private now, thanks to Google Street View. And if you are selling your home, you might decide against hiring the landscapers and just choose to post images of HomeOutside’s makeover version instead to maximize your curb appeal.</p><p>Once this visioning technology is commonplace, lots of different fields will start taking advantage of it. Home Depot, for example, recently invested in a startup called Hover, which, after digitizing your home in 3D, visualizes and prices new paint, siding, and roofing materials. SuperSight will soon show the actual paint crew up on their ladders, finishing the last few brush strokes, so you get that delightful experience of a job just finished. Volkswagen might put a new Passat in your driveway, complete with the kayaks and mountain bikes it knows you love on top. And the company trying to sell you home and car insurance? They’ll project a disaster scenario: solar panels fallen off, the shade tree hit by lightning, and your new Passat pummeled in a hail storm. Better buy the insurance before you repaint.</p><p>How will we interact with these types of immersive designs? With our SuperSight glasses on, will we point and place trees, or paint flowers from a palette of choices, like a 3D version of Photoshop? Will we select each plant from a vast menu of options for infinite control and customization, or will we just tell the system what we like so it learns our preferences, then proposes a single solution we’ll love? I believe in the happy medium: that we’ll largely prefer to see several “expertly composed” options and choose from among them, much as we do today when working with an architect, interior designer, or wedding planner.</p><p>Experts are usually so good at what they do that it’s often a mistake to over-specify particular details. For example, you shouldn’t tell an architect that you want a window exactly here, or an interior designer that you want this particular chair in a specific color in this corner. Instead, you express your opinions at a higher level of abstraction (“I want the room to feel more connected to the environment”) or through describing a required function (“We want a vegetable garden”), and let them do the detailed work.</p><p>The same expert-guided interaction model will dominate our relationships with SuperSight AIs. For landscaping, we might ask for a more formal French garden with rectilinear layouts and exotic colorful plants, or a curvaceous organic design that prioritizes privacy from our neighbors. We might indicate a preference for an open space for play, or for a filled-in scheme with more space for a productive garden. And as we express these higher-level interests, our 3D landscape design will dynamically recalculate to match our preferences. With SuperSight glasses on, we’ll be able to test our hunches faster by seeing reconfigurations immediately and in context, superimposed on our real home.</p><p>The jury is still out on whether HomeOutside will be able to use this technology to convince millions of homeowners to invest significantly in a sustainable landscape. The testing is promising, though; customers are delighted to see their yards reimagined and restaged. In the next five years, HomeOutside plans to use Google Earth and street view imagery in a generative AI tool to automatically redesign tens of millions of landscapes, with sustainable plants, shade trees, natural pollinators, and bird-friendly berries. If it succeeds, it will mean a million homeowners will plant at least 3 million new shade trees, like oaks and beeches, that will each capture 48 pounds of carbon a year as they mature.

As <em>AnandTech</em><a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17124/nvidia-announces-geforce-rtx-2050-mx570-and-mx550-for-laptops-2022s-entry-level-geforce">reports</a>, the company has <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/geforce-rtx-laptop-new-options/">introduced</a> an GeForce RTX 2050 laptop GPU that may sound like recycled low-end hardware, but is based on the same Ampere design found in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-rtx-3050-ti-ray-tracing-affordable-gaming-laptops-110058581.html">RTX 3050 series</a>. The naming scheme is confusing, to put it mildly, but that does give you up-to-date ray tracing in a potentially more affordable package.</p><p>You&#39;ll have to settle for a 64-bit memory bus instead of the 3050&#39;s 128-bit pipe, and the boost clock stops at 1,477MHz versus 1,740MHz. However, you&#39;ll still get the same 2,048 CUDA cores and 4GB of GDDR6 memory, while peak power consumption drops to a much more reasonable 45W compared to the 80W of higher-end chips. This is partly meant for &#39;in-between&#39; laptops that don&#39;t have the chassis space or batteries for RTX 30 GPUs.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has also revealed two entry-level chips, the MX550 and MX570, although it&#39;s shy on details beyond promises of more CUDA cores, faster memory and greater power efficiency than the MX450 they replace. The MX550 is based on the older Turing architecture, while the MX570 uses Ampere. Like with past MX chips, these are meant for thin-and-light portables where integrated graphics might not be good enough.</p><p>There&#39;s another issue beyond the branding: the release window. NVIDIA doesn&#39;t expect the RTX 2050 or new MX parts to reach shipping laptops until spring 2022. That&#39;s an usually long lead time, and suggests NVIDIA is announcing the GPUs now to clear the slate for CES in January. Whatever the reasoning, you&#39;ll have to be patient if you want a laptop with modern NVIDIA graphics but find RTX 3050-equipped systems beyond your reach.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2050-laptop-gpu-151030725.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e5ca206f-716b-4936-8e6e-57528403b1a3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 18 Dec 2021 15:10:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639840233</ingested><modified>2021-12-18T15:10:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/56ca57c0-600f-11ec-befb-522263874ea1" width="1920" height="768" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/56ca57c0-600f-11ec-befb-522263874ea1" width="1920" height="768" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050 laptop GPU]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2050 laptop GPU]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Recommended Reading: How a Netflix series changed Formula 1]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<h2><a href="https://theathletic.com/3003362/2021/12/12/drive-to-survive-the-f1-documentary-that-has-changed-a-sport/">Drive to Survive </a><a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/how-shein-beat-amazon-and-reinvented-fast-fashion/">—</a><a href="https://theathletic.com/3003362/2021/12/12/drive-to-survive-the-f1-documentary-that-has-changed-a-sport/"> the F1 documentary that has changed a sport</a></h2><p><strong>Matt Slater, </strong><strong><em>The Athletic</em></strong></p><p>An F1 season concluded last weekend with more drama than Netflix producers could dream of, and neither the service nor the racing series will be complaining.

As <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/12/17/apple-releases-first-macos-12-2-beta-public-testers/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> notes, the OS comes with a new Music app that Apple had rebuilt as a full native application. Apple introduced macOS&#39; dedicated Music app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-apple-announces-separate-music-podcast-and-tv-apps-for-mac.html">back in 2019</a>, but it kept some iTunes elements for some parts of it, which means it still displays web content within the app.</p><p>Based on what <em>9to5Mac</em> has seen, macOS 12.2 beta uses AppKit, the framework needed to give applications a native interface. There won&#39;t be a big difference in looks, but the new app will apparently work faster. Searching for songs within Music, for instance, will appear more quickly because the results will be displayed on a native interface, while scrolling will feel smoother and trackpad gestures will feel more responsive.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to a brand new Music app, macOS 12.2 will also make scrolling in Safari smoother for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">14-and-16-inch MacBook Pro</a> models that support refresh rates of up to 120Hz. To test out macOS 12.2, you&#39;ll have to <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/install-beta/">download and install</a> the macOS Developer Beta Access Utility.

The company also said it’s investigating the incident and that the driver is safe. Here’s the full text of the statement it shared with the outlet:</p><blockquote><p>This was a developing situation across a broad geographic area, and unfortunately the delivery service partner’s dispatcher didn’t follow the standard safety practice. This dispatcher should have immediately directed the driver to seek shelter when the driver reported hearing tornado sirens. While this text exchange was going on, the local Amazon team was ensuring each delivery service partner had directed their drivers to shelter in place or seek shelter and advised them to stop delivering for the evening. We’re glad the driver is safe and we’re using the learnings from this incident to improve our policies and guidance for delivery service partners and drivers. Under no circumstance should the dispatcher have threatened the driver’s employment, and we’re investigating the full details of this incident and will take any necessary action.</p></blockquote><p>Amazon’s policies have led to several incidents where workers were expected to clock in even during extreme weather.

It wasn&#39;t quite as popular as its predecessor the PlayStation Portable (or its main rival <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-3ds-10th-anniversary-games-160019952.html">the Nintendo 3DS</a>), and Sony is still trying <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-now-mobile-phones-181840562.html">to bring its gaming experience to mobile</a>, but the Vita still holds a special place in the hearts of those who owned one. At Engadget, that&#39;s Nathan Ingraham and Devindra Hardawar, who have both extolled the virtues of the system in our internal Slack many times over the years (yes, I checked). So on the Vita&#39;s 10th birthday we&#39;ve asked our resident experts what their favorite games for the system were, and inspired them to dig the shiny little handheld out of their closets for another go-around. — <em>Kris Naudus, Buyer&#39;s Guide Editor </em></p><h2><strong>Gravity Rush</strong></h2><div id="07026bc8a59344f3b4bf733386138740"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Q-p-41_V4Y?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The freedom of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-05-24-gravity-rush-review-disorient-express.html"><em>Gravity Rush</em>’s</a> acrobatic gameplay, which lets you fall through the air in every direction, as well as walk along the sides and bottoms of buildings, went hand-in-hand with the Vita’s portability. That made it a game I couldn’t help but love despite its frustrations. <em>Gravity Rush </em>took full advantage of the system’s motion controls — you had to tilt the Vita to control your flying momentum — and its watercolor anime aesthetic looked incredible on the Vita’s screen. Few games captured the magic of the system’s hardware that well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sure, the combat was simplistic and the story didn’t make much sense. But the visceral feeling of flying was hard to match, especially on a portable console. I never got around to playing the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:PlayStation 4 Gravity Rush remaster" href="https://amzn.to/3dWs2ZF">PlayStation 4 <em>Gravity Rush</em> remaster</a>, mostly because my memories of the game are so intimately tied to the Vita. I suppose it’s time to finally get over that hangup, though. The Vita is well and truly dead, and if I wanted to play the sequel, I have no choice but to move over to my PS4. — <em>Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Lumines: Electric Symphony</strong></h2><div id="c46dc0856e9d4f02b113e6db71a4b43d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h2AZPu6-8FU?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Every portable console needs a good puzzle game. For the PS Vita, it was <em>Lumines: Electric Symphony</em>. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:The first Lumines game" href="https://amzn.to/3dWseYT">The first Lumines game</a> was a launch title for the Vita’s predecessor, the PlayStation Portable, and <em>Electric Symphony </em>arrived when the Vita went on sale. The basic gameplay remained the same: you manipulate 2-by-2 squares of varying colors together and match those colors to clear things out. If your screen gets overloaded, that’s that.</p><p>What makes <em>Lumines: Electric Symphony </em>so engrossing is the way the gameplay is matched up to the beat of a lengthy selection of classic electronic tunes from artists like LCD Soundsystem, Aphex Twin, The Chemical Brothers and about 30 more. Each song has a different speed, and that speed is reflected in the gameplay; it’s not like <em>Tetris </em>where things progressively get faster and faster. It’s actually more like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Tetris Effect" href="https://amzn.to/3yCcweX"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a>, which was the first Tetris game to make music and sound <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-21-tetris-effect-ps4-synesthesia-psvr.html">a crucial part of the gameplay experience</a>.</p><p><em>Lumines: Electric Symphony</em> doesn’t reach the lofty heights of <em>Tetris</em> as a puzzle game, but that’s not a huge knock. It’s hard to compete with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-02-tetris-35th-birthday.html">one of the most popular video games of all time</a>, but <em>Electric Symphony </em>is still a great way to kill some time, either through a short session or a long play-through of the more than 30 tracks the game has to offer. — <em>Nathan Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2><strong>Modnation Racers: Road Trip</strong></h2><div id="3e3b718453624b2982bd92b06af74ced"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/STUJsvn_qpE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Ever since <em>Super Mario Kart</em> arrived in 1992, game developers have tried to emulate its appeal with little success. For my money, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Modnation Racers: Road Trip" href="https://amzn.to/3p4iyBO"><em>Modnation Racers: Road Trip</em></a> came pretty damn close. The PS Vita title was a new version of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2010-05-06-review-modnation-racers.html">a PS3 game that came out in 2010</a>. Both installments follow the Mario Kart script pretty closely: crazy tracks with weapons and items that let you even the odds against your competition.</p><p>What the Modnation Racers games did differently was offer endless customization — of your kart, racer and, most crucially, the courses themselves. Even on the somewhat scaled-back Vita game, you could download all manner of creations from the Modnation community, something that gave the game life for years until Sony inevitably shut down the servers.</p><p>Even without all the community content, though, <em>Modnation Racers: Road Trip</em> is still a blast to play. The 30 tracks in its career mode are extremely well designed, and the driving mechanics simply feel great. After almost 10 years, this game is showing its age, but it’s a great example of Sony’s promise to bring console-quality games to the Vita. The graphics don’t look quite as sharp as they used to, but the racing experience remains a blast. — <em>N.I.</em></p><h2><strong>OlliOlli</strong></h2><div id="ff23f58bd916479199b2d5cfc45aa30d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNYdqY72FxY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Sony initially pitched the PS Vita as a way to play console-quality games on the go, but its legacy is just as much about the smaller, indie games that hit the handheld. <em>OlliOlli </em>and its sequel <em>OlliOlli 2: Welcome to Olliwood</em> are two games that I played for hours on end, even though they weren’t as flashy and high-profile as games from bigger studios.</p><p><em>OlliOlli</em> is a masterful side-scrolling skateboarding game that combines lo-fi music and graphics with gameplay that was simple to learn, but maddening to master. And let me be clear, “maddening” is a complement. Once I figured out how to do more advanced moves and pull off longer combos to juice my score, I got addicted to the challenge of mastering every level.</p><p>And there’s a <em>ton</em> to master here; both games had five worlds to conquer, each with five “amateur” and “pro” levels. And, each level has five objectives to nail if you really want to be a completist. Usually, I don’t try to hit 100 percent of all the goals in a game, but here I was compelled to keep on pushing myself to beat as many challenges as I possibly could.</p><p>Both games have held up over the years, with the sequel adding crucial new mechanics like manuals, so you can skate through entire levels without stopping your combo. I recently replayed both, and still really enjoy trying to do a level as cleanly as possible — if you like chasing high scores, <em>OlliOlli </em>is a great option. And if you never tried these games, I’ve got some good news: <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:both are available for current PlayStation consoles" href="https://amzn.to/3q1xxvK">both are available for current PlayStation consoles</a>, and a new game, <em>OlliOlli World</em>, is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/olli-olli-world-release-date-nintendo-switch-indie-world-showcase-183933899.html">coming out on February 8th</a>. — <em>N.I.</em></p><h2><strong>Persona 4 Golden</strong></h2><div id="0f005b3d66284e5994c5df39eda3bd9b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lnwXbSYcywg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>I couldn’t have asked for a better introduction to the world of Persona than this title on the Vita. <em>Persona 4 Golden’s</em> bold and colorful aesthetic practically popped off of the system’s OLED display. (I can’t say if the later LCD Vita handled it worse.) It also featured one of the most memorable JRPG soundtracks I’ve ever encountered. Best of all, the Vita’s portability was perfectly suited to <em>P4G</em>’s grind. Being able to bring the game outdoors, on the subway and all over my apartment made leveling up feel more like a genuine adventure, rather than a typical JRPG chore.</p><p>For me, someone who grew up with every iteration of Game Boy, <em>Persona 4 Golden</em> also proved that portable systems could finally deliver a premium experience similar to home consoles. Sure, there were limitations around battery life and screen size, but in 2012 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-10-03-vitas-persona-4-golden-is-both-exciting-and-worrisome.html">playing a deep and visually rich RPG</a> on the Vita felt like a miracle. And honestly, it still does. Time to dig up my Vita. — <em>D.H.</em></p><h2><strong>Xenogears</strong></h2><div id="f6b8f830509b4296a244adcac3833d39"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AigacL-7e7Y?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>I know this is a bit of a cheat. But the Vita is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-02-21-xenogears-mechs-its-way-to-psone-classics-this-week.html">one of the last systems I own</a> that can still run <em>Xenogears</em>, Square’s brilliant and enigmatic <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion-</em>esque RPG. As someone who was fundamentally shaped by both <em>Chrono Trigger</em> and <em>Evangelion</em> in the ‘90s, <em>Xenogears </em>is that rare bit of culture that has always felt specifically made for geeks like me. I love it all: the unique combat, the eclectic Yasunori Mitsuda score and the giant mech battles. Hell, I even dig the exposition-heavy final act. Once the Vita arrived, being able to play <em>Xenogears</em> on the go made me fall for it all over again. — <em>D.H.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-vita-10th-anniversary-favorite-games-200013083.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e14266b-6c01-4e8d-9c93-a23db24ae91a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus,Nathan Ingraham,Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 20:00:13 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639771219</ingested><modified>2021-12-19T08:04:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a31aaf0-5e9d-11ec-bfbf-6a81b667bd79" width="4200" height="3000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a31aaf0-5e9d-11ec-bfbf-6a81b667bd79" width="4200" height="3000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AnthonyRosenberg via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Vancouver, Canada -- April 7, 2012: Close up of a man playing on a PS Vita video game system.
