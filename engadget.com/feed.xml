With the expansion, you can now access TV shows and movies from more than 200 different sources. Some of the more notable additions include IGN, CBC News and AccuWeather, as well as a linear channel devoted exclusively to the Tribeca Film Festival.</p><p>At launch, the latter includes 114 movies from the festival’s back catalog, with new films to come every 30 days. The channel will also feature original content from Tribeca Studios. While it won’t replace the in-person event, its addition is timely given how hard it’s been to make it out to a movie theater in the last year and a half.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The demand for free, quality programming continues to be of importance to our streamers,” said Ashley Hovey, director of the Roku Channel. “We’ve seen linear streaming explode over the last year, and we’re very excited to offer an all-new lineup of great channels with some of the most-recognized franchises to our users.”</p><p>If you need a refresher, the Roku Channel is a free way to watch ad-supported video content on your Roku device or TV. Last September, the company released <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-channel-android-ios-app-launch-130008587.html">standalone Android and iOS apps</a>, making the platform even more accessible.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/roku-channel-tribeca-film-festival-channel-172006958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">19907192-20e5-4ae5-80d8-fd80386d0910</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 17:30:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629306514</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T17:08:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/301966f0-0044-11ec-bf6f-2f5cb968a700" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/301966f0-0044-11ec-bf6f-2f5cb968a700" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roku]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roku Channel]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roku Channel]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook’s first ‘widely viewed content’ report argues political content isn’t actually popular]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook really wants people to know that it’s most popular content isn’t political and it’s releasing <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/widely-viewed-content-report/">a new report</a> to try to prove it. The social network released its first-ever “Widely Viewed Content Report,” documenting what it claims is the most-viewed content on its platform during the second quarter of 2021 in the United States.</p><p><a href="https://transparency.fb.com/data/widely-viewed-content-report/">The report</a> is Facebook’s rebuttal to commonly cited data that indicates posts from polarizing figures are consistently among the best-performing on the platform. <a href="https://twitter.com/FacebooksTop10"><ins>Data from</ins></a> Facebook-owned CrowdTangle, an analytics platform, commonly shows posts from conservative figures and outlets like Newsmax, Fox News, Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino get the most engagement.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Notably, none of those names appear in Facebook’s latest report, which included lists of top-performing domains, pages and specific public posts it said attracted the most eyeballs. Among the top domains were YouTube, Amazon, Unicef, GoFundMe, Spotify and TikTok. The most widely-viewed links included <a href="https://www.playeralumniresources.com/"><ins>a website</ins></a> for an organization associated with former Green Bay Packers football players. That page drew more than 87 million viewers, according to Facebook. An online storefront for CBD products was #2 on the list, with 72 million views. A <a href="https://64.media.tumblr.com/2d32d91bcdfa6e17f18df90f1fada473/6094b00761d82f16-76/s400x600/f0383899ecb1484b10e3420a368d871d7dc68f91.gifv?fbclid=IwAR3n0YcYEHv9twwBbpw7Lsu51LzmQEnyDv4OKvKSYRXAumwukGZOZrwMDAI"><ins>cat GIF</ins></a> from Tumblr with just over 49 million views was also on the list.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/13dcd3c0-0047-11ec-9e7c-a189fe9d6053" style="height:534;width:323;" alt="two of the most viewed posts, according to Facebook." data-uuid="afd74994-c122-37e1-8376-89d9d87f47bd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>When it comes to the most viewed public pages, Facebook’s list included Unicef, as well as animal site The Dodo, LADbible, and Sassy Media and other publishers that have built media companies off of viral Facebook content. Notably, most of the content Facebook put forward in its report didn’t appear to be overtly political. &quot;Many of the most-viewed Pages focused on sharing content about pets, cooking, family, and relatable viral content,&quot; Facebook wrote in a statement.</p><p>Interestingly, the most-viewed individual posts were all a collection of text-based memes, encouraging users to answer light-hearted (and mostly boring) questions, like what foods they don&#39;t like. The top such post was a year-old image challenging users to find three words hidden in a jumble of letters.

The company says it will release the “widely viewed content” report on a regular basis to help people track what type of content is being seen the most.</p><p>“There&#39;s a few gaps in the data that&#39;s being used today, and the narrative that has emerged is quite simply wrong,” Facebook&#39;s VP of Integrity, Guy Rosen, said during a call with reporters. “CrowdTangle is focused on interaction, CrowdTangle only has a limited set of certain pages, groups, and accounts. We are creating a report that provides a broad view and … an accurate representation of what people’s experiences actually are on our platform.”</p><p>Notably, the report only looked at public posts, and didn&#39;t include data around posts that may have used non-public privacy settings. The company said it would evaluate how it gathers and shares information for future reports. The company also said that more than half of posts that users see in their News feeds comes from their family and friends, not from pages or groups they follow. Mark Zuckerberg said in January, following the election and the January 6th insurrection, that he wanted to make News Feeds <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-content-news-feed-mark-zuckerberg-232846266.html">less political</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f35cb409-b50f-455d-90f8-140d71da5778</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 17:08:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629307525</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T17:25:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-11/8cafc0f0-fc5c-11e9-adfb-71fada7ace6e" width="4608" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-11/8cafc0f0-fc5c-11e9-adfb-71fada7ace6e" width="4608" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Derick Hudson via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[28th January 2019, Dublin, Ireland.

Facebook isn&#39;t making any additions to its existing policies, which cover its core app, Instagram and WhatsApp, but it&#39;s clear that it&#39;s making the Taliban&#39;s uprising a priority.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Still, that statement doesn&#39;t mean much if Facebook can&#39;t actually see what&#39;s happening on its platforms. <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93yvy5/whatsapp-says-its-not-banning-the-taliban-because-it-cant-read-their-texts"><em>Vice </em>reports</a> that the Taliban has been spreading its message on WhatsApp, which uses end-to-end encryption to secure conversations. The company could technically ban specific accounts, but it won&#39;t be able to easily search and remove content like it can on Facebook proper and Instagram.</p><p>Twitter, meanwhile, wouldn&#39;t say if it would ban notable Taliban accounts like spokesperson <a href="https://twitter.com/suhailshaheen1">Suhail Shaheen&#39;s</a>. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/17/tech/facebook-twitter-taliban-hnk-intl/index.html"><em>CNN reported</em></a> yesterday that he had 347,000 followers on the platform, but now he&#39;s amassed over 361,000, a clear sign of growing influence. Twitter noted that people were using its service to seek help in Afghanistan, and that it would continue to enforce its existing rules around things like the glorification of violence and hateful conduct. The company also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-report-misleading-tweets-202011787.html">introduced the ability to report misleading tweets</a> yesterday.</p><p>While Twitter is shying away from any definitive stances against the Taliban, a spokesperson noted: &quot;Our enforcement approach is agile and we will remain transparent about our work as it continues to evolve to address these increasingly complex issues.&quot; Basically, the rules could change at any moment.</p><p>YouTube is taking a stronger stance, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/17/tech/facebook-twitter-taliban-hnk-intl/index.html">telling CNN</a> that it would be terminating accounts run by the Afghan Taliban because the group appears on the US Treasury Department&#39;s sanctions list.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving forward, it&#39;s unclear how social media companies will recognize the Taliban as it takes control of Afghanistan. As the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/17/technology-202-facebook-twitter-youtube-face-high-stakes-question-whether-recognize-taliban/"><em>Washington Post reports</em></a>, it&#39;s up to social media firms to determine who maintains official state accounts like the <a href="https://twitter.com/ARG_AFG">Afghanistan President&#39;s</a> Twitter, which now has over 926,000 followers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-twitter-taliban-afghanistan-content-151603761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1934b7c0-b23b-4c0b-aec5-64a9fb6e7f0f</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 15:16:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629300368</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T15:26:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fa963f20-0035-11ec-bffb-b00956152962" width="4315" height="2872" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fa963f20-0035-11ec-bffb-b00956152962" width="4315" height="2872" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barcroft Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - AUGUST 18, 2021: Demonstrators including former interpreters for the British Army in Afghanistan protest in Parliament Square against Taliban and demand human rights in Afghanistan as MPs hold a debate on the crisis in Afghanistan in the House of Commons on August 18, 2021 in London, England.

It&#39;s a brand-new open-world adventure set in the Hisui region (later known as Sinnoh), and it takes place long before the events of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remakes-nintendo-switch-154100706.html"><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.</em></a></p><div id="f6aad7ecd84e4e649d47aa3a0aa1528f"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRsbFmM37T4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Since this is a different spin on the Pokémon formula, developer Game Freak has revamped the battle system, taking a similar approach to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-04-29-what-final-fantasy-x-did-differently-over-x-years-ago.html"><em><ins>Final Fantasy X</ins></em></a>. Battles are still turn-based, but rather than Pokémon each taking a turn, their respective stats and other facets such as items dictate the order of actions and how many each creature gets to take.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Pokémon might take multiple turns in a row, so you might take the opportunity to dish out multiple attacks on the spin or take time to heal up in between. Each of your Pokémon&#39;s four moves has two styles: agile style and strong style. The former speeds up your action speed and might bump up your next turn in the queue, but the move will be weaker than unusual. You can unleash a more powerful attack if you opt for strong style, though you might need to wait longer to act again. It&#39;s clear you&#39;ll need to rethink your battle strategies to be successful here.</p><p>Not only can you sneak up on wild Pokémon through tall grass to hurl a wooden Poké Ball at them, you can use smoke bombs to conceal yourself. Wild Pokémon also might attack before you deploy a Pokémon of your own. Battles will start right away rather than moving to a battle-specific screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/eed6e120-0031-11ec-bf6c-596552d3fd0d" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Pok&#xe9;mon Legends: Arceus" data-uuid="f3996ca3-f750-3db5-ba0f-c0bfefe89b04"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">The Pokémon Company</div></figure><p>Elsewhere, the trailer featured another look at the game&#39;s gorgeous visuals and other gameplay. It has expansive vistas that feel a bit reminiscent of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. You&#39;ll be able to ride certain Pokémon on land, as well as in the water or sky.</p><p>The aim of the game is to create the region&#39;s first-ever Pokédex, and you&#39;ll need to carry out research tasks to learn more about each Pokémon. There are base camps dotted around Hisui, where you can craft items and restore the health of your Pokémon. <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>arrives on Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-nintendo-switch-release-date-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl-135155853.html">on January 28th</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/94d86590-0031-11ec-bbb5-07d75de00437" style="height:720;width:1280;" alt="Pok&#xe9;mon Legends: Arceus" data-uuid="2981380e-c465-38bb-9ba5-964b1904434a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">The Pokémon Company</div></figure><p>Meanwhile,<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Pokemon%20Unite"><em>Pokémon Unite</em></a> is scheduled to hit iOS and Android on September 22nd.

They&#39;re quickly becoming less intrusive, however. <em>Reuters</em><a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/eco-friendly-vehicles-offer-quieter-cleaner-safaris-kenyan-reserve-2021-08-17/">notes</a> that the Kenyan-Swedish firm Opibus is converting diesel and gas safari vehicles in Kenya&#39;s Maasai Mara National Reserve into electric models.&nbsp;</p><p>The converted EVs are not only quieter, but don&#39;t rumble or spew foul odors that might alarm animals. Many of the other benefits of electric cars apply here, too. Opibus&#39; conversions don&#39;t produce CO2 emissions, and the company claims that electric motors cut operating costs in half by ditching fuel (and, we&#39;d add, the quirks of combustion engines).</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Opibus is the only company performing these conversions in Kenya, and it has only electrified 10 vehicles so far. There are also practical challenges to deploying safari EVs. African electrical grids aren&#39;t always reliable, and charging an EV in a nature reserve isn&#39;t as simple as finding a public station. There&#39;s also the simple matter of range — safari companies can&#39;t necessarily afford hours of downtime to recharge vehicles in between tours.</p><p>Even so, it&#39;s easy to imagine EVs finding widespread adoption in Kenya, South Africa and other countries where safari tourism is vital. The less intrusive the vehicles are, the more likely it is that wildlife will continue unimpeded. That&#39;s good for both the animals and the tourists hoping to spot elephants and lions that might otherwise stay away.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kenya-safari-ev-144021490.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eab85ad2-0346-4fb6-9374-d12656248533</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:40:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629299414</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T15:10:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/81b3ad80-002c-11ec-b6df-33e5002df133" width="2785" height="1838" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/81b3ad80-002c-11ec-b6df-33e5002df133" width="2785" height="1838" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Monicah Mwangi / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sylvester Mukenye, a tour guide at the Emboo River Camp drives an electric-powered safari vehicle during a game drive safari at the Maasai Mara National Reserve in Narok County, Kenya July 16, 2021.

Some players feel the detachable controllers are a bit small for their hands. Many players miss having a regular D-pad. Whatever your reasons for wanting to upgrade your Switch controller situation, know that there are alternatives — it’s just a matter of picking the one that fits your needs. We tested out a bunch of Switch controllers to see which are worth your money.</p><h2>For casual gaming: Joy-Cons</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/fedbf520-b70c-11ea-b5f7-4b676ea0ed7d" alt="Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, there’s a lot to like about the included Joy-Cons. They come right in the box and can be separated from the system so two people can play. The system also includes a special gamepad grip so you can hold them in your hand like any standard controller. So if you are in fact, happy with your Joy-Cons, there’s no need to switch them out. Just tweak them a little depending on your needs. Find them a tad too small? <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:FastSnail&#x002019;s matte rubber shells" href="https://amzn.to/3AWdCSX">FastSnail’s matte rubber shells</a> can make them a little easier for large hands to hold, and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hori&#x002019;s Analog Caps" href="https://amzn.to/3szOFcT">Hori’s Analog Caps</a> can make the thumb sticks grippier.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3AWdCSX" id="165bb9e542ee46e4929cbbc34f0817f5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy FastSnail grips at Amazon - $14</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3szOFcT" id="24d8076612314c338cd949aeddf836b1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Hori analog caps at Amazon - $9</a><p>There’s really no good way to replace the Joy-Cons entirely with a third-party copy. Some Joy-Con-like controllers won’t connect wirelessly, while others lack key features like vibration or an NFC reader. But there are some tradeoffs that are worth it. For example, if you like to play a lot of 2D platformers in handheld mode, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hori&#x002019;s D-pad controller" href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-D-Pad-Controller-Mario-Officially-Licensed/dp/B01AI0GLJK?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=cctbuyersguide21-20&amp;linkId=2a04ce4ebec72336c640709fe326be7d&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Hori’s D-pad controller</a> will restore the beloved cross-shaped directional button to your gameplay. If you’re looking for something that’s also more comfortable in your hand, the company’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$50 Split Pad Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3ARNI2G">$50 Split Pad Pro</a> is also worth a look.

But it also makes the entire assembled Switch a lot chunkier.</p><p>If you like to play your Switch with groups (or you’ve experienced the dreaded “drift” issue), chances are you’ve picked up one or two extra pairs of Joy-Cons. Which means you’re going to need a place to charge the spares.

The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Enhanced Wireless Controller" href="https://amzn.to/3xVTJt9">Enhanced Wireless Controller</a> skips the rechargeable battery in favor of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:AAs" href="https://amzn.to/2YvqfUq">AAs</a>, which has its downsides, but at least when it runs low on juice you can just pop in a new pair of batteries and get right back to gaming. Unfortunately, there’s no USB-C port to connect with so you’ll have to pair the device wirelessly — which can be finicky and may take a few tries before your Switch recognizes the controller. It also lacks vibration, so you won’t get tactile feedback in games where it’s helpful. And the plus and minus buttons are placed a bit closer to the center, so those with smaller hands will have to reach a bit further to press them.</p><p>If you’d prefer not to have to recharge — or buy batteries for — your gamepad, PowerA also makes a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:wired version" href="https://amzn.to/3meLoyG">wired version</a> of the same controller that connects via USB. It’s got the same look and feel, but you won’t have to struggle as much with getting your console to recognize it, and there’s no potential for wireless lag, making it ideal for fast-paced shooters and fighting games. The included cord is 10 feet long so it should reach most couches just fine.</p><p>While most third-party controllers tend to mimic the Xbox style of gamepad, anyone more familiar with the PlayStation’s distinctive DualShock design will probably prefer the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$50 Pro 2 from 8BitDo" href="https://amzn.to/3xSTrmJ">$50 Pro 2 from 8BitDo</a>. The retro-styled controller has the same general layout as the classic SNES gamepad, but adds twin thumb sticks, palm grips, back buttons, control remapping and even sensitivity adjustments. It’s truly the Swiss Army knife of Switch controllers.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xVTJt9" id="6d26d9c3bce64d42ab3b8b72a9ba8a85" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Enhanced Wireless controller at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3meLoyG" id="fb8cbc19a5b34dc7a9df0e0c2d97183a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PowerA wired controller at Amazon - $23</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xSTrmJ" id="64f0cd38ccb140dbacb3ebfe31fe788d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 8bitdo Pro 2 at Amazon - $50</a><h2>For old school gaming: Niche and retro controllers</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/1064ad40-b70e-11ea-a37f-e099d7f62310" alt="PowerA GameCube-style controller for Switch" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>Twenty years later and the preferred controller layout for Super Smash Bros. players is still the one made for the GameCube, which is why today it’s still possible to buy new gamepads straight from Nintendo.

If you’re subscribed to Nintendo Online, you have access to over 100 classic titles, so you might want a more “authentic” controller to use with them. Nintendo Online subscribers can buy retro-style wireless gamepads directly from the company, though the <a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-entertainment-system-controllers.html">$60 set of two small</a>, rectangular NES controllers will remind you why we’ve moved on from that design. The dog-bone shape of the <a href="https://store.nintendo.com/super-nintendo-entertainment-system-controller.html">$30 SNES model</a> is more hand friendly and can still be used with the NES games, so it’s a better use of your funds should you decide you want to recreate your childhood gaming experiences.</p><p>If you don’t need an exact copy of your beloved childhood gamepads it’s worth looking at 8BitDo instead: It makes a variety of classic-styled controllers that add just enough modern features to make them useful for a wider variety of games. Its models are almost all wireless, and there are some design changes to make the controllers more comfortable and easier to use. We’ve already recommended the DualShock-like Pro 2, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$45 SN30 Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3k3QHhJ">$45 SN30 Pro</a> also offers features like dual thumb sticks and vibration in the dog-bone controller style.</p><p>If you’re looking for something more portable, however, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$25 8BitDo Lite" href="https://amzn.to/2XGUw4Z">$25 8BitDo Lite</a> is smaller and swaps out the thumb sticks for two D-pads, keeping the four button arrangement on each side.

The laser shot vaporizes the gold, producing x-rays that implode the capsule and create fusion. The experiment produced 70 percent ignition, or 1.35 megajoules of the 1.9MJ from the laser. That&#39;s well short of what you&#39;d need from a fusion energy source, but eight times more powerful than the lab had managed before.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It will take a while for the research unit to further refine the process and achieve full ignition. There&#39;s also a large gap between achieving ignition and making a practical fusion power system — you&#39;d need to produce these fusion blasts a rate near 10 per second to collect energy from the resulting neutrons.</p><p>The test does show that laser-based fusion is a much more realistic prospect than first thought, however. If there&#39;s further progress, the technique could produce effectively &#39;unlimited&#39; energy that could solve the electrical grid&#39;s capacity issues while remaining clean and safe.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/laser-powered-fusion-energy-breakthrough-134058739.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b23d0ea8-6bdd-4263-9228-d8240623b8f1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:40:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629297448</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T14:37:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/09b80b60-0021-11ec-973a-5b55e45fdf64" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/09b80b60-0021-11ec-973a-5b55e45fdf64" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Laser beams produce x-rays that implode to create fusion]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Laser beams produce x-rays that implode to create fusion]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Holoride’s in-car VR gaming system leaves the track for the real world]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="e5d3dcd837024cfbbe3d277e5427e3f7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWVmkAICPYw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Holoride’s VR gaming system for passengers caught our attention <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-audi-backseat-vr-disney-marvel.html">a few years back at CES</a> when we were given a ride in an Audi on a track and had the game react to the movement of the vehicle while we played.

The visual discovery website has introduced hair pattern search, it said, with BIPOC users in mind. This new feature uses computer vision-powered object detection to enable users to refine their searches by six different hair patterns: protective, coily, curly, wavy, straight and shaved/bald.</p><p>Now, after users search for broader terms like &quot;summer hairstyles,&quot; &quot;glam hair&quot; or &quot;short hair,&quot; they&#39;ll find new hair pattern buttons that will narrow down the results. The feature is now live in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand on desktop, as well as on iOS and Android. It will roll out to more locations over the coming months.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yes, there are different types of curls, not to mention different hair textures and porosities, and Pinterest said its technology detected hair patterns in over 500 million images on its platform. Being able to refine results could help POC users find styling inspiration more easily instead of having to wade through pages and pages of hair images that wouldn&#39;t work for their hair types. That said, it remains to be seen how accurate the feature is and if it&#39;s truly effective in sifting through images on the website.</p><p>According to the company, this feature builds on its first inclusive product that allows users to search for images based on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-skin-tone-search-updates-161657313.html">subjects&#39; skin tones</a>.

As a visual discovery platform, we have an opportunity and responsibility to do a better job of increasing representation in the products we build. That&#39;s why we built hair pattern search using computer vision technology to help identify hair patterns in images. By doing this, we hope we&#39;re able to use technology for good and make it easier for people, no matter who they are, to find hair inspiration for them on Pinterest.&quot;</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b4a75e60-001a-11ec-bfef-cb4e28508bdc" style="height:1000;width:750;" alt="Pinterest" data-uuid="25f15e7a-8cea-3a1b-843a-9fc7417350f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pinterest</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-hair-pattern-search-130002097.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c2ac252-b8c3-48bd-85d3-1d9820f5bbe5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629288275</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T12:04:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Hair Care]]></category><category><![CDATA[Beauty]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e0f86b0-0016-11ec-9fbf-49df31c82b48" width="1600" height="1064" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e0f86b0-0016-11ec-9fbf-49df31c82b48" width="1600" height="1064" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pinterest]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pinterest]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Pinterest]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's latest earbuds are for people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A number of companies make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-14-assistive-hearing-wireless-earbuds-bragi-nuheara.html">&quot;hearing enhancement&quot; devices</a> that look more like a set of earbuds than a piece of clinical tech. Nuheara has been a staple at CES with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-nuheara-iqbuds2-max.html">IQbuds line</a> and companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aids-152746656.html">Bose</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-08-bragi-project-ears-hearing-aids-tinnitus.html">Bragi</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-olive-union-smart-ear-hands-on.html">Olive</a> and others have offered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-15-upgrade-your-hearing-with-technology.html">a mix of tech and hardware</a> to assist with hearing loss. Even Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-features-ios-15-180549807.html">plans to introduce a &quot;Converstaion Boost&quot;</a> for its AirPods Pro. Since the FDA allows companies to sell directly to consumers with mild-to-moderate hearing loss without the need for a prescription, the list of options is constantly growing. Another company that&#39;s specifically equipped to blur the line between hearing aid and true wireless earbuds is Jabra, thanks to the auditory assistance expertise of its parent company GN.&nbsp;</p><p>With the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Jabra Enhance Plus" href="https://fave.co/2W6Pn53">Jabra Enhance Plus</a>, the company offers a more approachable device for people who may not need what all-day hearing aids offer just yet.

Those are already some of the smallest buds I&#39;ve tested, so reducing the size even further makes the Enhance Plus more comfortable and more discreet.

Similar to other earbuds, the Enhance Plus comes with multiple sizes of ear tips to help you find the best fit, on-board controls and water/dust resistance (IP52). Jabra says they&#39;ll last 10 hours on a charge with 30 hours total when you factor in the charging case. An app assists with setup and offers a degree of customization.&nbsp;</p><p>Jabra plans to launch the Enhance Plus at &quot;select hearing care clinics&quot; in the US &quot;towards the end of the year.&quot; A licensed professional will conduct a hearing test to make sure these earbuds are appropriate. There&#39;s no word on pricing just yet, but the company says it&#39;s applying for approval under the FDA&#39;s self-fitting category. If you&#39;re looking for more of a true hearing aid rather than these &quot;enhancers,&quot; Jabra also offers the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Enhance Pro" href="https://fave.co/37Vvvoc">Enhance Pro</a>. It carries the more traditional behind-the-ear hearing aid design along with a charging case. It&#39;s also pricey, starting at $1,800.&nbsp;</p><p>If that&#39;s what you&#39;re after, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aids-152746656.html">Bose SoundControl hearing aids</a> went on sale in May, and as of last week, are available in all 50 states. That device puts the company&#39;s audio expertise to use to help you hear better, and Bose said it was the first FDA-cleared hearing aids that could be sold directly to consumers. What&#39;s more, they&#39;re more affordable at $850, but they run on the typical zinc-air batteries for hearing aids rather than being rechargeable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 1:13PM ET: </strong>Bose SoundControl hearing aids are now available in all 50 states after a limited rollout at launch. This post has been updated to clarify that availability.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-enhance-plus-earbuds-130001782.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47866dfa-cf8e-43e3-bc2f-ea7ce82bf125</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629306899</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T17:15:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7dba3930-ffb2-11eb-bdab-ad9c957ba6c1" width="1600" height="1068" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7dba3930-ffb2-11eb-bdab-ad9c957ba6c1" width="1600" height="1068" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jabra]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Enhance Plus]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Enhance Plus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku devices are back on sale at Amazon, including the Streambar for $99]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, we saw a number of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-99-deal-amazon-roku-streaming-devices-sale-134034742.html">Roku streaming devices</a> receive big discounts on Amazon — including the Roku Streambar, which went down to $99.

It also works as a Bluetooth speaker as well, but we found the device sounded better when watching action movies than when playing our favorite pop playlists.</p><p>The other discounted Roku products are best for those aren&#39;t as interested in an audio upgrade as they are in streaming power that comes in a small package. The Streaming Stick+ has ended up in many of our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-home-entertainment-streaming-devices-cheap-tvs-for-students-123020749.html">home entertainment guides</a> thanks to its affordability and relatively comprehensive feature set.

The Express 4K+ is very similar, but it supports smooth wireless connectivity instead of long-range.

If you&#39;d rather not use the TV&#39;s built-in speakers, you can still wirelessly output the center channel audio to a compatible soundbar or front speakers.

You can also play audio from your TV elsewhere in your home if you have a <a href="https://play-fi.com/news/dts-play-fi-arrives-on-tvs"><ins>multiroom setup</ins></a>. In addition, you can listen to audio from your TV through headphones via an app.&nbsp;</p><p>The Play-Fi Home Theater approach isn&#39;t entirely new.

Apparently, some older versions of QNX have a BadAlloc vulnerability, which gives bad actors a way to attack systems remotely. The infiltrators could then execute a denial-of-service attack or execute arbitrary code. BlackBerry, the FDA and US Homeland Security&#39;s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (<a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-229a?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">CISA</a>) have issued advisories about the flaw. According to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/17/blackberry-qnx-vulnerability-hackers-505649"><em>Politico</em></a>, though, BlackBerry originally didn&#39;t want to go public about it and kept it a secret for months.</p><p>The company reportedly told CISA that it didn&#39;t believe its OS was affected by BadAlloc, which is a group of memory allocation vulnerabilities Microsoft <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/04/29/badalloc-memory-allocation-vulnerabilities-could-affect-wide-range-of-iot-and-ot-devices-in-industrial-medical-and-enterprise-networks/">found</a> in April affecting a wide range of industrial, medical and enterprise networks. A number of companies publicly revealed being affected by the flaw shortly after Microsoft&#39;s report came out, but BlackBerry wasn&#39;t one of them. <em>Politico</em> says it was CISA that confirmed that some older QNX versions are indeed affected by BadAlloc, and it was the agency that eventually convinced the company to go public.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apparently, the agency was worried that most QNX users wouldn&#39;t even know their systems are affected, because BlackBerry licenses the OS to manufacturers. The company originally wanted to privately reach out to those customers about the issue, but that means end users won&#39;t find out unless manufacturers tell them, as well. In the end, CISA was able to convince BlackBerry that a public announcement is the best course of action.</p><p>In its <a href="https://support.blackberry.com/kb/articleDetail?articleNumber=000082334">notice</a>, BlackBerry said it&#39;s &quot;not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability.&quot; Both the company and CISA are advising organizations using QNX for their products to roll out updates that will patch the flaw regardless. The FDA also <a href="https://www.mddionline.com/regulatory-quality/blackberrys-cybersecurity-flaw-may-affect-your-medical-device">issued a warning</a> specifically for medical devices running the OS, though it said it wasn&#39;t aware of any confirmed events related to BadAlloc.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blackberry-qnx-cars-medical-devices-vulnerable-110746229.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">491e0991-835f-46ca-89ca-637f629a287c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 11:07:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629283689</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T10:48:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/549cd1d0-0006-11ec-babc-7166331d09b9" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/549cd1d0-0006-11ec-babc-7166331d09b9" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Megias via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CPU vulnerability. 3D render. hacked processor concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[CPU vulnerability. 3D render. hacked processor concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile confirms data breach affects over 47 million people]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its ongoing data breach <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-confirms-data-breach-203719462.html">investigation</a>, T-Mobile has confirmed the enormity of the stolen information.

Elliot Carter, a recreational mapmaker, contacted law enforcement after his site about Washington, D.C.&#39;s underground infrastructure witnessed a spike in activity from suspicious websites. His warning eventually made it to the highest ranks of the Capitol Police, according to a new investigation by <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/investigations/dc-tunnel-history-site-flagged-suspicious-activity-before-capitol-insurrection/2775341/"><em>News4 I</em></a>.</p><p>Normally a mecca for local history buffs, the <a href="https://www.washingtontunnels.com/">Washington Tunnels</a> website Carter oversees was flooded with nationwide visitors in the days before the insurrection. A deeper review of the traffic analytics revealed that many of the clicks were coming from hyperlinks shared on anonymous message boards, sites and forums named after militias or firearms, or using Donald Trump’s name. Though the initial interest originated from the deepest and darkest recesses of the web, it eventually transitioned onto popular social media sites, including Twitter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Washington Tunnels website itself was a labor of love. Back in 2018, Carter <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/amateur-archivist-takes-a-quest-through-history--and-the-dc-regions-extensive-tunnel-system/2018/10/08/f320a934-c658-11e8-b1ed-1d2d65b86d0c_story.html">set to work</a> building his online resource of the District&#39;s subway and freight rail tunnels, pedestrian passageways, underground steam tunnels and sewage and water pipelines. But, even then he was rebuffed by some government agencies concerned by the security and terrorism risks that could arise from publishing such information online.</p><p>Carter&#39;s &quot;online tip&quot; to the FBI was mentioned in the US Senate Rules and Homeland Security committees&#39; June 2021 <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HSGAC&amp;RulesFullReport_ExaminingU.S.CapitolAttack.pdf">review </a>of the US Capitol insurrection. In a statement to <em>News 4 I</em>, the US Capitol Police said its leadership had been alerted &quot;to the spike in website traffic regarding maps&quot; ahead of the insurrection. But, added that its wider intelligence gathering &quot;didn&#39;t reveal [that the expected] large-scale demonstration would become a large-scale attack on the Capitol Building.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/owner-of-obscure-dc-tunnels-website-alerted-fbi-of-suspicious-activity-before-us-capitol-insurrection-092945691.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">946554f5-fbc3-497c-8f73-7b87ddf351aa</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 09:29:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629289600</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T12:27:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64f49720-001f-11ec-9ecb-5efb439594bc" width="3445" height="2297" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64f49720-001f-11ec-9ecb-5efb439594bc" width="3445" height="2297" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[The Washington Post via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The front of the US Capitol building seen through protective barriers.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[1233900443 Capitol building]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spectrum TV is back on Roku devices over half a year after it was pulled]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Charter Spectrum customers found themselves unable to download the Spectrum TV app from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-removes-youtube-tv-google-contract-dispute-143232936.html">Roku&#39;s</a> Channel Store if they hadn&#39;t done so before back in December. The two companies were unable to come to an agreement on the renewal of their contract, and it led Roku to <a href="https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/roku-removes-spectrum-app-from-channel-store-in-carriage-dispute/">pull the app</a> from its store to prevent new downloads. Now, it looks like they were finally able to hammer out a deal that works for both of them, because the <a href="https://blog.roku.com/en-gb/spectrum-tv-app-roku">Spectrum TV app is back</a> on the Roku Channel Store. All customers need to do to access its live and on-demand content is sign in with their Charter broadband account credentials.&nbsp;</p><p>Back when the app was pulled from the store, Spectrum said Roku didn&#39;t accept its offer to renew its contract &quot;despite [its] best efforts.&quot; The company then told its customers that they can still access the app through their phones and tablets, as well as on Samsung TV, Apple TV and Xbox. A Roku spokesperson said in a statement, though, that they were &quot;working together to reach a positive and mutually beneficial distribution agreement.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The companies didn&#39;t reveal the details of the new deal, but what&#39;s important is that subscribers can now download the Spectrum TV app after eight months.

The list includes Bravo, CNN, CNBC, Fox, NFL, SyFy, NatGeo and HBO Max, though accessibility depends on their subscription.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spectrum-tv-app-roku-channel-store-061245388.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ef83b91-ba2a-427a-a211-8c165dc7535b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 06:12:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629267239</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T06:14:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dfa9f3f0-ffdb-11eb-bef4-204e79797b11" width="1200" height="628" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dfa9f3f0-ffdb-11eb-bef4-204e79797b11" width="1200" height="628" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roku]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Roku]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Roku]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Fortnite' adds a limited-time Among Us-like mode]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Epic Games has released a new limited-time mode in <em>Fortnite</em> called <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/trust-nobody-introducing-fortnite-impostors">Imposters</a>, allowing players to scratch their <em>Among Us</em> itch without leaving the battle royale. Each match features two teams made up of eight agents and two imposters.</p><div id="75cc69c5d4034bbc851a8752f156364c"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W1RNbUaCKHA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The action takes place in a new interior map called The Bridge. The agents need to complete various tasks to get to the end of the match safely. Naturally, the imposters are there to throw a wrench in that plan. When a dead body is found, everyone who’s still alive convenes to voice their suspicions and vote who they believe committed the crime. In a twist to the proceedings, public voice chat is disabled, and you’ll need to use a quick chat menu and emotes to communicate with anyone who isn’t in your party.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As an imposter, you have a handful of tricks up your sleeve to throw the opposing team off your tracks. You can make both agents and imposters temporarily look like <em>Fortnite’s</em> banana mascot Peely, as well as teleport everyone to a different location on the map. Like in <em>Among Us</em>, you also have the power to freeze the progress of any assignments the other players are working on in and around The Bridge.</p><p>For Epic Games, this is its second take on <em>Among Us</em>. At the end of last year, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-the-spy-within-gameplay-mode-174720132.html"><ins>released The Spy Within</ins></a>, another limited-time mode that saw players divided into teams of eight agents and, in that case, two infiltrators. You can queue to play Imposters once you download the latest <em>Fortnite</em> update.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-among-us-imposters-mode-220745090.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6fac3265-bd86-48c2-bf9f-feacbf029c43</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 22:07:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629238103</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T22:46:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/139d44e0-ffa6-11eb-9cea-973446e786af" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/139d44e0-ffa6-11eb-9cea-973446e786af" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Epic Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fortnite Imposters]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fortnite Imposters]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
