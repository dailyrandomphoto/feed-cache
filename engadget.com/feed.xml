According to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-slows-meta-platforms-metaverse-strategy-by-extending-antitrust-probe-of-vr-deal"><em>The Information</em></a>, one of the purchases the Federal Trade Commission is looking into is its $400 million deal to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-acquiring-within-supernatural-123904948.html">acquire Within</a>, the developer of popular virtual reality workout app <a href="https://www.engadget.com/supernatural-vr-workout-app-beat-saber-chris-milk-130014895.html">Supernatural</a> for the Oculus platform.&nbsp;</p><p>The agency reportedly opened a probe into the purchase after Thanksgiving, almost a month after the companies announced the acquisition back in October. If the report is true — neither the FTC nor the companies confirmed the regulatory review to the publication — then Within and Meta wouldn&#39;t be able to finalize the deal for another year. It could take even longer than that if the agency challenges it in court.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Within wasn&#39;t the only VR app developer that Meta had acquired, but the others were apparently too small to be investigated. VR fitness apps, like at-home workout equipment, soared in popularity during the lockdown, and Supernatural quickly became popular after its launch in April 2020. As <em>The Information</em> notes, one of the FTC&#39;s possible lines of inquiry is whether Meta was planning to develop a VR workout app of its own. It will take Meta less time to snap up an existing product than make one of its own, after all.</p><p>Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg famously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-case-161230871.html">said</a> in the past that &quot;it&#39;s better to buy than to compete,&quot; with regards to Facebook&#39;s Instagram acquisition. The FTC recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ftc-facebook-amended-antitrust-case-161230871.html">filed new antitrust charges</a> against the company, accusing it of using its Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions in 2012 and 2014 to secure its position in the market. Meta is still also facing an investigation over its reported $400 million <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-144640114.html">Giphy purchase</a> in 2020.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-ftc-probe-acquisition-vr-workout-app-supernatural-within-125553153.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">05fc6cef-336b-4349-aaaf-1753f60ad32b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 12:55:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639745644</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T12:54:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25d6dd30-5f30-11ec-8fff-8f9e06f6542b" width="1600" height="1040" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/25d6dd30-5f30-11ec-8fff-8f9e06f6542b" width="1600" height="1040" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Within/Meta]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Supernatural]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Supernatural]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: 'Final Fantasy XIV' is so popular that Square Enix stopped selling it]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Square Enix is <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/news/detail/e7388986bc24d5a1337e0beed057f7b5b78b9bb3"><ins>suspending</ins></a> the sales and delivery of<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-suspends-final-fantasy-xiv-sales-114053735.html"><em><ins>Final Fantasy XIV</ins></em></a><em> Starter Edition</em> and <em>Complete Edition</em> because it&#39;s doing too well and the company&#39;s servers can&#39;t keep up.

Typical image sensors have the light-sensitive photodiodes and pixel transistors that control and amplify the signal on the same layer. However, the new design puts the photodiodes on top and the pixel transistors below, &quot;approximately doubling saturation signal levels,&quot; Sony said.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony pioneered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2012-09-21-sony-exmor-rs-stacked-phone-camera-sensors-detuned-over-quality.html">stacked sensors</a> that put fast memory and other electronics directly under the sensor, allowing for faster readout speeds and thus rapid burst shooting and reduced rolling shutter (jello effect) on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">cameras</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-1-iii-review-143002186.html">smartphones</a>.

That in turn allows for around double the light-capturing capability.</p><p>Sony notes that because the transistor pixels sit on a separate layer, it was able to boost the amplifier transistors in size. That allows for a bigger signal boost, reducing noise when shooting nighttime or other images in dark locations. The increased dynamic range will allow for &quot;high-quality, low-noise images even in low-light,&quot; according to Sony.&nbsp;</p><p>Sony specifically stated that the tech will allow for higher-quality smartphone photography. With double the light gathering capability, it will allow for much improved light sensitivity even in relatively small, high-megapixel sensors. Sony has yet to say when this tech will make it to smartphone or cameras, but it plans to further improve the design for both large and small sensors.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/e701f7d0-5f24-11ec-afd5-27d0f59cf838" style="height:523;width:1031;" alt="Sony&#39;s latest smartphone camera sensor can gather twice as much light" data-uuid="82806018-64df-38b0-ba71-d92bee42a788"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-cmos-smartphone-sensor-2-layer-twice-as-much-light-112503027.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9d69e1e-9a48-4264-8ecb-950c6fdc3089</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 11:25:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639737683</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T10:41:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/faad85f0-3612-11ec-9acf-90247a162075" width="4074" height="2717" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/faad85f0-3612-11ec-9acf-90247a162075" width="4074" height="2717" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[YUKI IWAMURA via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Sony logo is displayed at the company's headquarters in Tokyo on April 28, 2021.

On top of that, the new models come with more accessories to make calibration and working in bright rooms easier.&nbsp;</p><p>The 32-inch model appears to be much the same as before, with features like a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, true 10-bit color, 60Hz refresh rate and 99 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space. As before, it also conforms to the VESA DisplayHDR 400 True Black standard for OLED displays.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The relative lack of brightness and huge contrast ratio shows the compromises and benefits of an OLED display for content creators, in a nutshell. On the one hand, with 400 nits of brightness the UltraFine OLED is barely adequate for doing HDR color grading compared to much brighter (1,000 nit+) mini-LED displays like Apple&#39;s $5,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-pro-display-xdr-hdr-marketing-uk-164640510.html">Pro Display XDR</a> or the $5,000 ASUS ProArt <a href="https://fave.co/3CwT3NN">PA32UCG-K display</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/6a17dd20-5f1a-11ec-bd77-880d47f592ef" alt="LG launches a 27-inch version of its pro Ultrafine 4K OLED monitors" data-uuid="9a6c0c05-e818-3a8c-8585-a65215c2eabd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">LG/Yi Cheol</div></figure><p>On the other, LG&#39;s OLED display has much better contrast, perfect blacks and zero blooming because each pixel illuminates individually. That feature can give color professionals a much better idea of the true contrast in an image. So in essence, buyers have to make a tough choice between brightness and contrast, both of which are important for color work these days — particularly with video.&nbsp;</p><p>The new 27-inch model will attract folks who want the benefits of OLED and the other pro features (10-bit color, 99 percent DCI-P3 and a 1,000,0000:1 contrast ratio) at a lower price. Both displays also offer features like a clean professional design, USB-C with 90W power delivery and four USB ports. It also comes a pair of DisplayPort inputs and one HDMI port. LG&#39;s doesn&#39;t say what kind for the latter, so it&#39;s likely not HDMI 2.1 — though that&#39;s not crucial for content creation pros.&nbsp;</p><p>The biggest upgrade over last year is that both monitors include a color calibration sensor (LG didn&#39;t say which one), along with its LG Calibration Studio software. They also come with a monitor hood so you can better control the image depending on room lighting. LG hasn&#39;t released the pricing yet, but its current 32-inch UltraFine Display OLED Pro Monitor costs a cool $4,000, so expect to see a similar price on the new model. The 27-inch version, meanwhile, will likely be north of $2K.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-launches-a-27-inch-version-of-its-pro-ultrafine-4-k-oled-monitors-093236507.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ca2274f8-efbd-4592-bdf7-c31584c0d7cf</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 09:32:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639733799</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T09:36:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/45622f90-5f14-11ec-937b-2b6c2b6c1362" width="2560" height="1704" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/45622f90-5f14-11ec-937b-2b6c2b6c1362" width="2560" height="1704" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG/Yi Cheol]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG launches a 27-inch version of its pro Ultrafine 4K OLED monitors]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG launches a 27-inch version of its pro Ultrafine 4K OLED monitors]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG soundbar with a center up-firing speaker will lead its CES audio lineup]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>LG has given us a glimpse of the audio products it&#39;s showcasing at next year&#39;s CES, specifically the lineup&#39;s crown jewel: A premium soundbar, which the company claims has the &quot;world&#39;s first center up-firing speaker.&quot; The <a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/12/new-premium-soundbar-from-lg-delivers-next-level-audio-for-todays-at-home-lifestyle/">LG S95QR soundbar</a> has an 810W output and 9.1.5 channels of surround sound. That&#39;s five up-firing channels, three of which are on the soundbar itself and two in the separate rear speakers.&nbsp;</p><p>The company says the up-firing channels provide realistic sounds, made even more immersive by the center up-firing speaker that enables clearer dialogue delivery. LG&#39;s premium soundbar supports Dolby Atmos, DTS:X codec and IMAX Enhanced titles for three-dimensional audio. The wireless rear speakers it comes with also have six channels instead of four like previous models do, with their four front/side drivers and two up-firing ones.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, the model has a more sensitive receiver that allows greater distance between the soundbar and its accompanying rear speakers and subwoofer. It was designed with a more stable wireless connection to eliminate drops and lags in audio output, as well. In its announcement, LG is presenting the model as an option for gamers, due to its variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low latency mode (ALLM) features that can adjust its output and ensure that it&#39;s in sync with gaming consoles and PCs.</p><p>The S95QR soundbar uses LG&#39;s AI Room Calibration, the company&#39;s automatic sound tuning technology, to analyze the space it&#39;s in to tailor its output. It also works with Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa and other AI assistants for voice control. Aside from its audio lineup, LG is showcasing a couple of lifestyle TV models at CES. One of them is design-focused 65-inch OLED Evo TV <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-design-focused-oled-tv-moving-cover-131546091.html">with a motorized cover</a>, while the other is a smaller <a href="https://www.engadget.com/l-gs-stanbyme-wireless-tv-101519278.html">battery-powered TV on wheels</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-soundbar-s95qr-ces-2022-073941883.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">55ab8b04-989c-4f0f-9170-a88c7b88079c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 17 Dec 2021 07:39:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639726784</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T07:39:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/09fcc810-5f01-11ec-ab7e-fefdc8c4567e" width="1600" height="1041" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/09fcc810-5f01-11ec-ab7e-fefdc8c4567e" width="1600" height="1041" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LEAD Technologies Inc.

As part of the experience, Hulu will also generate recommendations for current and upcoming content that is similar to the stuff you watched recently.</p><p>It’s no surprise to see the company offer a year-end recap. If social media is any indication, Spotify has had tremendous success with Wrapped. Each year, it seems like Spotify users flock to Twitter and Facebook to share their yearly chronicles. At the same time, you frequently see those who use Apple Music and other platforms lament that their music streaming service of choice doesn’t offer something similar.

According to <a href="https://www.lightreading.com/cable-tech/comcast-will-keep-data-caps-out-of-the-northeast-in-2022/d/d-id/774117"><em>Light Reading</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840165/comcast-data-cap-delay-isp-dec-2021"><em>The Verge</em></a>, a Comcast spokesperson said the cable giant now had &quot;no plans&quot; to enforce internet data caps in the region throughout 2022. State Rep. Andy Vargas even <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAndyVargas/status/1471109198842896384">claimed</a> the strategy might be on indefinite hold — he understood Comcast had &quot;no plans to reintroduce&quot; the ceiling at any point.</p><p>The telecom first said <a href="https://www.engadget.com/comcast-1-2-tb-cap-expanding-181736862.html">in November 2020</a> that it would expand its 1.2TB cap enforcement to the Northeast in 2021, but delayed the move by a year in February 2021.

It will help Northeastern residents breathe easier, though, and could keep their costs down if they don&#39;t want to pay for overages or unlimited data. The additional delay also casts doubt on the need for caps in the first place. If Comcast can go without enforcing caps in numerous states for two years, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-12-comcast-att-broadband-coronavirus.html">rivals like AT&amp;T</a> can make even broader gestures, why do the caps exist?

The streaming company has <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-12-16/spotify-is-building-on-megaphones-capabilities-with-the-acquisition-of-whooshkaa/">acquired</a> Whooshkaa, an Australia-based firm that offers a tool to convert radio broadcasters&#39; shows into podcasts. Spotify plans to integrate the tech into its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-megaphone-ad-tech-in-third-party-podcasts-145805535.html">Megaphone suite</a> for podcasters with a clear goal — stations could further profit from shows by offering ad-supported podcast episodes.</p><p>Whooshkaa might also boost some of Spotify&#39;s other efforts.

Right after Mark Zuckerberg delivered a meandering keynote extolling the benefits of the metaverse, the company revealed it had repainted its iconic “thumbs up” sign that sits at its headquarters in Menlo Park. Many of its social media accounts also switched over, from Facebook to Meta.</p><p>Except for one key account, that is. As many pointed out at the time, the company didn’t control the @Meta handle on Instagram. It belonged to a small Denver-based magazine <a href="https://www.readmeta.com/">called <em>META</em></a>. The day of Facebook’s announcement, the company, which publishes lifestyle stories about motorcycles, posted a photo of assorted print issues with the caption <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CVlb1pZlmvc/">“Since 2014.”</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That evening, recent posts from the @Meta account were filled with comments encouraging the owner to “hold” the account, or at least sell it for a high price. “Hold and sell high,” one user wrote. But by the next day, the account had mysteriously vanished, as <em>Quartz </em><a href="https://qz.com/2081386/facebook-has-the-meta-handle-on-twitter-but-not-instagram/">reported</a>. It’s unclear exactly what happened, but @Meta has now subsumed all the content from the previous @Facebook Instagram page. Posts on the account predate October 28th, as if the social network had always controlled it. Posts from <em>META</em>, the magazine, now appear under the @readmeta handle.</p><p><em>META </em>the publisher didn’t respond to requests for comment. But there are still signs of its former Instagram account on its website. The company’s website still links to its old instagram.com/meta account. Oddly, clicking on that link from the publisher’s website turns up an error, even though it links to the same URL as the now Facebook-owned Meta account.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/154e38c0-5ea7-11ec-bffe-3f024dd95e59" alt="The magazine&#39;s website still links to instagram.com/meta but the link doesn&#39;t work anymore." data-uuid="8b3020e8-c132-3362-bd34-fa87b0b0a9d8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot / Engadget</div></figure><p>On Tuesday, Ben Geise, <em>META</em>’s co-founder and editor-in-chief, announced that the magazine’s most recent issue would be the last under the name it had used for more than eight years. “We value our individuality above all else, so when the news broke that a corporate Goliath was changing its name to Meta, it felt like a punch to the gut,” he wrote in a <a href="https://www.readmeta.com/blog/keep-on-rolling">blog post</a>. “With the flip of a switch our identity was suddenly watered down, and we watched our name circle the drain and wash away with something we had no control over.”</p><p>Geise didn’t respond to requests for comment, so it’s difficult to know exactly what happened. But Instagram’s terms of service state that businesses are unable to “reserve” handles. And the terms stipulate that companies can’t claim trademark violations if the account owner is using it for an unrelated purpose. “Using another&#39;s trademark in a way that has nothing to do with the product or service for which the trademark was granted is not a violation of Instagram&#39;s trademark policy,” the policy <a href="https://help.instagram.com/101826856646059">states</a>. “Instagram usernames are provided on a first-come, first-served basis.”</p><p>Of course, accounts and handles often trade hands anyway. Businesses have been known to use escrow services to negotiate account transfers, while others have used <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-bans-hundreds-accounts-ogusers-takedown-201528230.html">shadier marketplaces</a> to gain access to accounts with desirable handles.</p><p>But the practice is also <a href="https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870">officially prohibited</a> by Instagram’s terms of service. “You can’t sell, license, or purchase any account or data obtained from us or our Service,” the terms of service states. “This includes attempts to buy, sell, or transfer any aspect of your account (including your username); solicit, collect, or use login credentials or badges of other users; or request or collect Instagram usernames, passwords, or misappropriate access tokens.”</p><p>That raises questions about whether Facebook skirted its own rules in order to gain access to a coveted username, the kind of action other users are routinely banned for. Or whether the company found another justification for taking over the account. An Instagram spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>For now, <em>META</em> the publisher says it’s focused on the future. “Our brand is much more than just a name. We represent a way of living,” Geise wrote. “We speak to inspire and encourage the rare breed of humans out there bold enough to chase their dreams and never look back.”</p><p><strong>Update 12/16 7:10pm ET:</strong> A spokesperson for Meta said that there were no trademark claims or legal threats made against <em>META</em> the publisher, but declined to comment on whether the social network had been in touch with the magazine or whether they had been compensated for their username. &quot;We allow people to change their usernames on Instagram,&quot; Meta spokesperson Stepahnie Otway said in a statement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/what-happened-to-the-meta-instagram-handle-195027598.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e376aa9-3ff4-4eb2-a92f-4891be90d071</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 19:50:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639699920</ingested><modified>2021-12-17T00:12:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ce812590-3842-11ec-9d2b-225fab6fcfd5" width="4825" height="3217" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ce812590-3842-11ec-9d2b-225fab6fcfd5" width="4825" height="3217" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MENLO PARK, CA - OCTOBER 28: People take photos of the new "Meta" sign at the One Hacker Way in Menlo Park, as Facebook changes its company name to Meta in California, United States on October 28, 2021.

This week, the automaker unveiled the <a href="https://www.hyundainews.com/en-us/releases/3467">Mobile Eccentric Droid</a> or MobED, a new mobility platform for taking on even the trickiest surfaces and uneven ground.</p><div id="a8a360297fd540b9a29dffbb2bb1994a"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tzV-GI7n1GI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company’s Robotics Lab says it developed MobED to overcome the limitations of existing indoor and service robots. Each of the robot’s wheels features independent power and steering control systems that allow it to rotate in place and move in any direction. It also has an eccentric drive system, hence the name, that allows it to independently adjust the height of each of its wheels. As you can see from the video, that means it can provide a stable platform for something as delicate as glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>MobED can expand its wheelbase up to about 25 inches when it needs as much stability as possible. It can also contract to about 17 inches when it finds itself in more complex environments. All told, the platform is approximately 26 inches long, 23 inches wide and 13 inches tall. A 2 kWh battery allows the robot to drive for approximately four hours on a single charge.</p><p>Outside of working as a service robot, Hyundai envisions MobED helping out in places like the movie industry where film crews could mount their equipment to the platform. It could also be used for deliveries and other purposes where stability is essential. We’ll get a chance to see more of the robot when Hyundai demos it at CES 2022 next month. However, the company hasn&#39;t said if it plans to commercialize MobED.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hyundai-mobed-annoucement-180932482.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">aa53711f-324a-4d05-9145-99e26d02ad19</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 16 Dec 2021 18:09:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1639678176</ingested><modified>2021-12-16T18:09:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a8b6080-5e99-11ec-bf34-61814849afbc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/8a8b6080-5e99-11ec-bf34-61814849afbc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hyundai]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[MobED]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MobED]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok is testing a desktop livestreaming app]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It seems <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/tiktok">TikTok</a> is getting into <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-livestream-mute-temporary-harassment-184929315.html">livestreaming</a> from desktops.

Only &quot;minimum service&quot; offerings will remain untouched. Everything else is going up. Some increases are modest, such as for Optimo Mas and Choice ($4 and $5 respectively), but grandfathered users subscribed to tiers like Ultimate or Premier will pay $10 more per month.</p><p>The move raises the base pricing of DirecTV&#39;s Stream Choice to $90 per month, while Premier will cost $150 per month. Satellite customers won&#39;t be immune to increases, either. Outside of minimum service and ChineseDirect Plus, you&#39;ll see increases on January 23rd between $1 (for most Basic and Family plans) to $10 (for Max and Plus). And while some regional sports fees are dropping in price, there&#39;s now a fifth, $12 per month tier on top of the previous $10 maximum. You may see a price drop or increase depending on your ZIP code.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The firm wasn&#39;t shy about its reasoning. While hikes like these are frequently pinned on steeper programming costs, DirecTV said &quot;higher-than normal inflation&quot; from suppliers was also to blame. It costs more to offer service, and the company is passing on at least some of those costs to its customers.</p><p>These increases are common in the TV industry, and that includes streaming rivals.

It will adjust the algorithm that populates the FYP with a never-ending stream of videos to stop it from showing too much of the same kinds of content.</p><p>&quot;As we continue to develop new strategies to interrupt repetitive patterns, we&#39;re looking at how our system can better vary the kinds of content that may be recommended in a sequence,&quot; TikTok <a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/an-update-on-our-work-to-safeguard-and-diversify-recommendations"><ins>wrote in a blog post</ins></a>. &quot;That&#39;s why we&#39;re testing ways to avoid recommending a series of similar content — such as around extreme dieting or fitness, sadness or breakups — to protect against viewing too much of a content category that may be fine as a single video but problematic if viewed in clusters.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The service is also working on a way to identify when the algorithm only shows a user limited kinds of videos. It notes that, while videos about loneliness or weight loss might not violate the platform&#39;s rules, those kinds of videos could have a negative impact if they make up most of what a user sees on the For You page. So, preventing that from happening is important.</p><p>&quot;Our goal is for each person&#39;s For You feed to feature a breadth of content, creators, and topics,&quot; TikTok said, noting that too many similar videos appearing in the feed doesn&#39;t reflect the kind of experience it wants to foster. The service is consulting with its Content Advisory Council and the community, as well as experts from the fields of medicine, clinical psychology and AI ethics.</p><p>In addition, TikTok is developing an option that will let users block videos linked to certain words or hashtags on the For You page. That will give them more control over what they see on the home screen.</p><p>The FYP <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bytedance-sells-tiktok-ai-182553001.html"><ins>recommendation algorithm</ins></a> is TikTok&#39;s secret sauce and one of the main reasons why the app became incredibly popular. The app&#39;s systems monitor users&#39; engagement habits, such as how long the screen stays on a particular piece of content and the videos someone likes, to determine the kinds of videos that might keep them hooked on the FYP.</p><p>At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in October on the effect of social media on children and teens, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-tiktok-snapchat-youtube-204825470.html"><ins>senators pressed representatives</ins></a> from TikTok, Youtube and Snap on several matters.
