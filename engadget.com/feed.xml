Even billionaires who can afford to pay for a trip beyond the atmosphere of our planet — or at least <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-throws-shade-virgin-galactic-133319071.html">somewhere in that vicinity</a> — can only look out from their spaceships. Episodes 3 and 4 of the immersive series <a href="https://time.com/space-explorers/"><em>Space Explorers: The ISS Experience</em></a>, however, will give you a way to see what it&#39;s like to float around in space. To make that happen, Felix &amp; Paul Studios, one of the series&#39; creators, customized a virtual reality camera and attached it to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-05-27-dextre-canadarm2-robot-iss.html">Canadarm2</a> robot to capture 3D, 360-degree scenes from outside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-crew-2-dragon-docks-with-iss-153112501.html">space station</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Felix &amp; Paul&#39;s &quot;Outer Space Camera&quot; is a customized version of the commercially available Z-Cam V1 Pro. It has nine 4K sensors that can take 3D, 360-degree images at 8K resolution. The camera has also been modified to withstand harsh conditions, including UV radiation, temperature extremes and micrometeoroid impacts. The team attached it to the Canadarm2 robotic arm, which moves around the station&#39;s external structure.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Jonathan Woods, the series&#39; executive producer for Time Studios (one of the entities behind the project, along with NASA), said:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Capturing the Earth in stereoscopic 3D, 360-degree format from space, outside the space station, has never been attempted until now. It&#39;s beyond exciting and surreal to see this happening, knowing that the dream for this ambitious project started over five years ago in 2015.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Episodes 3 and 4 will be available this fall and winter, respectively, in 360-degree mobile format on 5G-enabled devices through leading carriers around the world, including LGU+ in South Korea, KDDI in Japan, Orange in France and Deutsche Telekom in Germany. They will also be available as fully immersive VR experiences on the Oculus Store for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-04-oculus-rift-s-review-vr.html">Rift</a>, the Quest and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oculus-quest-2-128gb-now-available-180638366.html">Quest 2</a> headsets.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spacewalk-virtual-reality-123303570.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92eb191b-f866-4129-8706-3d74124ec66b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 12:33:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630153987</ingested><modified>2021-08-28T12:33:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/38c8b110-07e3-11ec-9ffa-73cce01e9026" width="1596" height="949" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/38c8b110-07e3-11ec-9ffa-73cce01e9026" width="1596" height="949" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Felix & Paul Studios/Time Studios/NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Space Explorers: The ISS Experience]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Space Explorers: The ISS Experience]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon disables ISIS propaganda website using AWS to host content]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Islamic State&#39;s propaganda arm used <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-180852407.html">Amazon Web Services</a> to host content <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-twitter-taliban-afghanistan-content-151603761.html">promoting extremism</a>, according to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/08/27/amazon-isis-app-cloud/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>. Nida-e-Haqq, the group&#39;s media arm, posted messages on the website in the Urdu language, including ones celebrating the recent suicide bombing in Kabul that killed 170 people. Since Amazon&#39;s policy bars clients from using its services to incite violence and terror, the company pulled the website after <em>The Post</em> alerted it to its existence.&nbsp;</p><p>The website Amazon disabled provided content for the Nida-e-Haqq app, which recently showed an image of the Kabul bomber wrapped in a suicide vest.

The organization has been using services like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and WhatsApp to spread its message, and the websites now have to decide if they need to update their policy on how to deal with Taliban content and to make sure their existing rules on violence and terror are properly enforced.</p><p>Amazon didn&#39;t say how Nida-e-Haqq managed to evade detection for at least four months when it wasn&#39;t even trying to hide what kind of content it posted, but it&#39;s very much possible that the company simply didn&#39;t know the website existed. As <em>The Post</em> said, Amazon may not be proactively policing its clients&#39; content, relying instead on the complaints it gets.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in January, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-suspends-parler-aws-access-025310355.html">suspended</a> Parler&#39;s AWS hosting services after it found multiple posts on the social network &quot;that clearly encourage and incite violence.&quot; Parler sued Amazon, claiming antitrust violations, but the company said it sent the website <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-responds-parler-lawsuit-203419366.html">several warnings</a> about violent posts on its platform before the takedown.

Part of that wide-ranging investigation will apparently involve a close look at the biggest social media companies in the world. The committee today <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-committee-demands-records-related-january-6th-attack-social-media-0">announced</a> that it was requesting records relating to the attack from 15 companies, who were asked to respond in the next two weeks.</p><p>It&#39;s a who&#39;s who of the biggest players on the internet, including Google, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Snap, Twitch, Telegram and TikTok. On the list are a number of smaller, pro-Trump sites that have sprung up in recent years, including Gab and Parler, as well as known cesspools 4chan and 8kun (formerly 8chan).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Specifically, the Select Committee wants records relating to the spread of misinformation, efforts to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, efforts to prevent certification of the election, foreign influence attempt in the election, and domestic violent extremism. Additionally, the Committee is also looking for materials from these companies relating to any policy changes that were considered or adopted to address misinformation, violent extremism and foreign malicious influence.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the Committee wants to hear both about policy changes that were put into place as well as things that the companies &quot;failed to adopt.&quot; One example of a change that came about in response to the attack happened recently at Facebook, where the company adopted a recommendation from its Oversight Board. The company walked back its policy that allowed politicians to circumvent some of its rules under the guise of “newsworthiness,” though politicians still do get special treatment around other rules, like fact-checking.</p><p>It&#39;s been clear since the Select Committee came together that it was going to take the time to gather a huge amount of information to properly investigate the events of January 6th, and that extends to its requests to these companies. Now, the ball is in their respective courts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-select-committee-social-media-company-records-demand-211356022.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a16e0a6c-a5d5-4b67-87c0-ec8b581001d7</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:13:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630105647</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T23:07:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-01%2F8bf401c0-56ac-11eb-affe-cf3bea30c425&amp;compress=1&amp;progressive=1&amp;quality=75&amp;resize=200%2C300&amp;client=hawkeye&amp;signature=a972cd5c17df99a98f8fb102d705b2bbf5fefa72" width="200" height="131" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/8bf401c0-56ac-11eb-affe-cf3bea30c425" width="5004" height="3285" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SAUL LOEB via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[(FILES) Supporters of US President Donald Trump walk around in the Rotunda after breaching the US Capitol in Washington, DC, January 6, 2021. - The demonstrators breeched security and entered the Capitol as Congress debated the 2020 presidential election Electoral Vote Certification.

While the complaints point to alleged misconduct specific to each company, they broadly accuse DoorDash and GrubHub of employing a similar set of unfair business practices.</p><p>Specifically, the city claims that both DoorDash and GrubHub have consistently advertised delivery services from restaurants that never consented to a listing on their platforms. The city also alleges they employ &quot;bait-and-switch&quot; tactics by using deceptively small delivery fees to lure customers before hitting them with various other expenses at the end of a transaction. Finally, it says they both hide the fact many restaurants charge less for the items on their menu when you order directly from them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DoorDash called the lawsuit &quot;baseless&quot; and a &quot;waste&quot; of taxpayer money. &quot;DoorDash has stood with the City of Chicago throughout the pandemic, waiving fees for restaurants, providing $500,000 in direct grants, creating strong earning opportunities and delivering food and other necessities to communities in need,&quot; a spokesperson for the company told Engadget.</p><p>GrubHub echoed the sentiments of its competitor. &quot;Every single allegation is categorically wrong, and we will aggressively defend our business practices,&quot; a GrubHub spokesperson said. &quot;We look forward to responding in court and are confident we will prevail.&quot;</p><p>In taking the two companies to court, the city says it seeks to mandate greater transparency from DoorDash and GrubHub, as well as financial restitution for restaurants and consumers hurt by their alleged actions.</p><p>Separately, the DoorDash lawsuit alleges the company misled customers about how it was using tips to pay its delivery workers. If that sounds familiar, it&#39;s because DoorDash agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-settle-dc-lawsuit-045945934.html">pay a $2.5 million settlement</a> toward the end of 2020 to settle allegations related to that exact same issue.</p><p>For Chicago, this is the latest effort by the city to impose additional regulations on food delivery apps. In May 2020, it implemented a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chicago-itemized-breakdown-delivery-apps-210224890.html">policy </a>that saw both DoorDash and GrubHub required to include an itemized breakdown that lists how much restaurants pay when you order from them using an app.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/chicago-sues-doordash-grubhub-210424254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c29ba824-a0d9-4deb-a56d-ecbffb741acb</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:04:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630098268</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T21:04:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/1b429850-a77a-11eb-bffa-cc370d18fec2" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/1b429850-a77a-11eb-bffa-cc370d18fec2" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, USA - FEBRUARY 18: A food delivery guy with bicycle is seen as snowfall blankets the Times Square in New York City, United States as massive snow storm hits the east coast on February 18, 2021.

In <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210827005402/en/Amazon-Partners-with-Affirm-to-Deliver-Pay-Over-Time-Option-at-Checkout">a statement</a>, the companies said they have already begun testing the feature with &quot;select customers.&quot; It&#39;s unclear how many people might see this option early, or in what markets.

The financial terms offered depend on both the person&#39;s credit history and the purchase price, she said.

That’s the question Google had to ask itself before releasing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">Pixel 5a</a> in the US and Japan on Thursday. The answer the company settled on was to hire a soft-spoken actor to do their best <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-jony-ive-legacy.html">Jony Ive</a> impersonation and wax poetic about the humble headphone jack.</p><div id="086c35a574054448b25254dbd31bddaf"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJZuSVl5wjM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>It’s a usual approach, but one that highlights a feature that’s missing in most modern phones, and in a way that’s funny and memorable. “The circle: perfect, simple. Some might say simply perfect,” the actor declares in the opening moments of the clip, reciting a script that perfectly apes the <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/06/28/jony-ive-best-apple-videos/">overwrought writing</a> that Ive’s videos at Apple became known for in his <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-jony-ive-lovefrom.html">later years at the company</a>. When the ad shortly thereafter turns to materials, you <a href="https://youtu.be/2DXLj5GaKcY">know exactly where it&#39;s going</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Forged and machined from the finest premium-grade copper and iron. Housed in a unibody of diecast aluminium,” the actor says of the component, a voice in the background softly whispering, “fancy pronunciation.” Make sure to stay for the end of the clip to hear a fun bonus on that front.</p><p>But my favorite part of the clip involves how the Pixel 5a’s headphone jack is “designed to welcome both three-pole TRS and TRRS connections.” Translation: you can plug a headset with an in-line microphone into the phone and it will work without issue. It all culminates with the actor stating, “Yes, it’s a headphone jack. With the Google Pixel 5a with 5G, the circle has finally come full circle.” While the ad is mostly in good fun, it&#39;s worth pointing out Google&#39;s high-end phones haven&#39;t had headphone jacks in years, nor will the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">Pixel 6</a> include one when it comes out later this year.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5a-ad-headphone-jack-jony-ive-191812803.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">55584d08-f383-4599-82c0-e48b5eec0a94</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 19:18:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630091897</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T19:18:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bb982f90-feb9-11eb-bb7c-374b2d4dc638" width="2048" height="1153" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bb982f90-feb9-11eb-bb7c-374b2d4dc638" width="2048" height="1153" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5a]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5a]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Galaxy Z Fold 3 review: Doing the most and yet not enough]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="eea252f9a6d94c1fb478c2b203a81128"><iframe src="https://delivery.vidible.tv/htmlembed/pid=5706c5c8e4b03b51471aefba/564f3144ff690c0a7c285e51.html?vid=612845f45728e86e567a3fc4&amp;m.playback=autoplay&amp;m.disable_moat=1" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>If you’ve been following the rise of foldable smartphones, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-samsung-galaxy-fold-review-expensive-experiment.html">the Galaxy Fold</a> probably holds a special place in your heart. It was the first of its kind to make it to market, and despite a troubled debut and wobbly sophomore launch, the series is now on its third generation. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Z Fold 3" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> is all grown up and stronger than ever. It’s had time to learn from the mistakes of its youth, and Samsung has devoted a ton of research into fortifying the foldable’s screen, hinge and overall build. This year, it’s added support for the S Pen, as well as water resistance and more optimized software. The phone is also $200 cheaper, now starting at $1,800. But despite all its growth, the Fold 3 is still undergoing an identity crisis.</p><h2>Design</h2><p>Just by looking at it, you wouldn’t be able to see a difference between the Fold 3 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">its predecessor</a>. The two have basically the same dimensions, with this year’s model coming in a little thicker. But despite gaining 0.4mm when unfolded, the Fold 3 is actually 0.8mm thinner than the Fold 2 when closed. It appears Samsung might have been able to reduce the gap between the two halves of the screen when it refined its hinge mechanism.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That said, without a side-by-side comparison, you probably won’t notice this. You also might not realize that the Fold 3 is 10 grams (or 0.35 ounces) lighter than its older sibling, either. But it’s certainly heavier than most other smartphones. It’s about 45 grams (or 1.58 ounces) heavier than the iPhone 12 Pro Max and the S21 Ultra, and after prolonged use my arm started to feel the strain. Still, it’s basically two phones in one, which means the only device that might be fair to compare it to is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-review-software-camera-specs-130024046.html#hardware">the Surface Duo</a>. Microsoft’s dual-screen phone is noticeably thinner and lighter than the Fold 3.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd350ea0-074f-11ec-bbdb-86107783ed85" alt="A closed Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 sitting on a window ledge with its triple cameras facing up." data-uuid="16eea1be-dc60-3674-898b-d9dfda9cd644"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel For Engadget</div></figure><p>Because it didn’t have a flexible display, though, the Surface Duo presented less of an engineering challenge. Durability is a greater concern with foldables like the Fold and Flip 3. Samsung said it used stronger aluminum in the Fold’s frame, streamlined its hinge and redesigned the screen’s layers to make the device sturdier. It also applied a new stretchable PET protector on the panel. Altogether the company said the Fold 3’s screen is 80 percent more durable than its predecessor.</p><p>That’s not something I can gauge without intentionally trying to damage the Fold 3. But its screen does feel more glass-like than the original, and the protector completely covers the display so you won’t see its edges that tempt you to peel it off. Some reviewers noted bubbles appearing on their Fold 2 after a few months, and since it hasn’t been that long, I can’t say for sure if the new model will do the same.</p><p>For now, though, the Fold 3 has withstood being tossed around in a purse full of sharp and heavy objects and still looks pristine. It also survived some droplets of water after I set it down near the sink when I was washing my hands, thanks to its new IPX8 water-resistance.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/97009a60-0750-11ec-afbd-9b51e8231aa7" alt="The Thom Browne edition of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold half opened and with its back facing the camera." data-uuid="65ee5a57-e475-320d-a972-186bc82120d2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>When open, the Fold 3 is easy enough to hold with one hand, though I generally held it with both for easier typing. While I appreciate that the hinge is sturdy enough that you can leave the phone open at any angle, it makes unfolding the device kind of hard. The magnets that keep the device shut are very strong, so you’ll have to first pry them apart and then push deliberately to extend it all the way. In fact, I had a few close calls where I almost dropped the Fold 3 when struggling to open it.</p><p>Thankfully, I didn’t, because any scratches would be quite obvious on my all-black review unit. The Fold 3 <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-fold3-5g/buy/galaxy-z-fold3-5g-256gb-att-sm-f926uzkaatt/?cid=sem-mktg-pfs-mob-us-google-na-08092021-141317-&amp;ds_e=GOOGLE-cr:0-pl:307569818-&amp;ds_c=FF~Core_CN~galaxy+fold_PH~laun_MK~usnat_BS~im_PR~smart_SB~q2_PK~ROAS_FS~lo_CA~kew_KS~ba_MT~exact-&amp;ds_ag=AG~Core_MK~usnat_AT~ta_MD~h_PK~roah_PB~google_AI~no_TG~na_SA~mass-&amp;ds_k=galaxy+z+fold3&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw1JeJBhB9EiwAV612y8xBO6fYFo3DvH1muLbGKepLO7ITkeOn2MyMBGUcCtEofEXySB8uRxoCQMAQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">also comes in silver, green</a> and a Thom Browne version with red, white and blue stripes. You’ll have to spend $3,450 to get the latter in a limited-edition bundle, though.</p><h2>A tale of two displays</h2><p>Outside, the Fold 3 has a 6.2-inch 2,268 x 832 display, which now refreshes at 120Hz. It also uses a Dynamic AMOLED panel, which supports HDR10+ as opposed to last generation’s Super AMOLED. The faster screen makes scrolling my neverending inbox super smooth, and pictures on my Instagram feed look vibrant. Aside from these upgrades, the Fold 3’s external display is basically the same as its predecessor’s, which means it has a similarly narrow aspect ratio.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/77e451c0-0751-11ec-b5e9-369516f4fa4e" alt="A hand holding up the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 with its screen open and facing the camera. A crease runs down the middle of the home page. " data-uuid="84a1700c-b81a-3eea-8092-e9f5098b067c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>While that makes the closed device easier to navigate with one hand, it also means most content feels cramped. Buttons on the keyboard, for example, are smaller and harder to aim for, while lengthy messages and tweets take up more lines so you’ll see fewer on the page at once.</p><p>Thankfully, when you need more room, you can open up the Fold to use the 7.6-inch Dynamic AMOLED panel inside. Like the outside display, this has a 120Hz refresh rate, and it runs at 2,208 x 1,768. To give you a more immersive full-screen experience, Samsung used an under-display camera (UDC) here that can camouflage beneath pixels so you won’t have to see the little hole that most modern phones have for their selfie sensors.</p><p>I don’t know about you, but I never found those tiny circles to be very obstructive or much of an eyesore. Still, if you really hate seeing it, the good news is the UDC does disappear into the screen with the right background or app. The bad news is that you’ll still see it on darker wallpapers, and even when the screen above the camera is displaying something, it creates a noticeable ring of pixelation.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/96ac7f90-0753-11ec-973c-7e8159ad9573" alt="A close up of the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3&#39;s under-display camera. You can make out grid of individual pixels above the sensor." data-uuid="5998bd0f-cc06-3ad4-8311-e83fa14b29b6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>This didn’t bother me much, and after some time I even forgot the camera was there. Most people likely won’t mind the little distortion the UDC causes. Regardless, the rest of the screen is bright, colorful and crisp, making it a pleasant canvas for my videos and casual games.</p><h2>S Pen and multitasking software</h2><p>The Fold 3’s internal display isn’t just great for Netflixing. With S Pen support this year, the foldable screen is more useful for those who want to write notes or sketch diagrams on that expansive surface. You’ll have to pay an extra $50 for the S Pen Fold edition or $100 for the Pro model, which comes with a case. The Fold version doesn’t require charging and is pretty basic, while the Pro needs power for features like switching between other Samsung phones and Bluetooth controls. Either way, there isn’t a slot on the phone for the stylus, so you’ll have to put up with carrying around a loose accessory.</p><p>If you’re willing to splurge, the S Pen is a generally helpful tool on the Fold 3. I mostly used it as a cursor to make navigating the larger screen easier, but it’s also fluid and responsive when doodling on Samsung Notes. The company also offers an “S Pen to text” setting that lets you more easily edit text by marking dittos, arrows or strokes directly on words. Drawing a line through letters, for example, will erase them.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c0cb9450-0753-11ec-b7f7-13f6cb671238" alt="A person using the S Pen Pro to draw on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3. They are holding the phone, half-folded, in their left hand with an S Pen Pro in their right. On the screen, they&#39;ve scrawled " data-uuid="8d27fcfc-7e66-34cc-b485-86177a218e5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>I’m not a fan of having to bring around any extra items to use a phone, but the S Pen did make it easier for me to write this review on the Fold 3 from the back of a cab. Trying to type on its larger screen with my fingers is a huge pain, and the stylus came in handy, making swipe typing more accurate. I also loved scribbling into search bars and messaging apps — Samsung’s system is surprisingly adept at recognizing my awful handwriting.</p><p>While I’m not sure it’s worth the extra $50, I can appreciate the work Samsung had to do to make S Pen support a reality. As I dragged the nib around the screen during a bumpy ride, I managed not to damage the flexible display with any accidental pokes and stabs.</p><p>Even without the S Pen, the larger internal panel still offers a variety of useful multitasking features. Like its predecessors, the Fold 3 lets you place two apps side by side so you can keep an eye on Slack while writing a review or monitor Twitter for PlayStation 5 release news as you read articles on Chrome.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fa7d2bf0-0753-11ec-affb-ecf091c7ca62" alt="Watching a video with the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 half bent and sitting up on a window ledge like a mini laptop." data-uuid="22e6a5d1-071a-3f8e-b929-9ce49570e984"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>This year, Samsung made it so you can pin the Edge panel to the screen so it acts like a desktop-style taskbar for easy access to your open and favorite apps. It’s a simple but tremendously useful update. Now, instead of having to swipe in to pull up the Edge panel and then drag an app out to open it in split-screen, the icons are already there. It does take up a column of space, though, which makes running two apps at once feel cramped. Thankfully, it&#39;s easy enough to hide with a tap.</p><p>It feels as if the floating panel has finally found its home on the Fold 3 since Samsung first launched it on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-09-samsung-galaxy-note-edge-review.html">the Galaxy Note Edge</a> in 2014. What used to be a somewhat awkward, only slightly convenient feature is now an actually useful tool that makes the Fold 3 feel like a more capable multitasking device.</p><p>Another thing Samsung did to improve the Fold’s big-screen experience is add the option to make all apps expand to fullscreen. Through its experimental Labs settings, the company lets you choose whether individual apps launch in 16:9, 4:3 or fullscreen. In the past, for example, Instagram would refuse to expand completely, resulting in an unsightly setup with the phone-sized app in the middle and blank space on either side. Now, you get to decide how much of the display they should take up.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1c81aaf0-0754-11ec-bfaf-ba00583c2916" alt="Browsing Instagram on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-uuid="fd7bb263-570e-3cad-a499-764f51706be1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>This only works partially, though. Yes, my feed does take up the whole screen, but watching and posting Stories still reverts to the phone-sized orientation. Also, a lot of pictures on Instagram look splotchy when the app is blown up. Samsung still has a ways to go, but I applaud the effort.</p><p>The company offers more features in Labs to improve the full-screen experience, including enabling Multi Window and Flex Mode panels for all apps. Like the aspect ratio tweak, these can be hit or miss. Flex Mode panel adds a mini dashboard to the bottom part of the screen when you half-open and set the Fold 3 up like a laptop. Some apps are optimized for this to offer useful, well-spaced controls in this space. But for the ones that aren’t, like Chrome, Samsung’s software slaps a tiny, inch-tall row of four buttons at the bottom for keyboard, screenshot, brightness and volume.</p><p>I could go on about the rest of Samsung’s software, like how the App Continuity feature doesn’t always keep content in the same place when you open the Fold up to see something on the bigger screen. But that would take forever. In general, it feels like Samsung is putting more and more effort into band-aid solutions when Google should really be working on optimizing Android for tablets.</p><section data-eng-breakout="59ff456964e54c248b38380a0444b21a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/392005d0-0754-11ec-b6fb-4fe2297ffc8c" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 standing on a desk with its triple camera system facing the camera."></section><h2>A plethora of cameras (including one under a display)</h2><p>Like a person trying to be too many things, the Fold 3 is an overachiever. And the fact that it has <em>five</em> cameras onboard almost feels excessive. There’s a 10-megapixel selfie camera, the UDC, which is just 4-megapixels sharp and a trio of 12-megapixel sensors on the rear, including regular, ultra wide and telephoto lenses.</p><p>Most of these cameras perform just as well as iPhone and Pixel flagships, delivering bright, colorful pictures in most situations. It did justice to rows of mouthwatering sushi, clearly rendering scallions and individual grains of rice.</p><p>My nighttime shots of the USS Intrepid on the Hudson River also came out sharp and bright, though Google still has the edge in low light. Pictures of trees and buildings taken with the Pixel 5’s Night Sight mode were clear enough that leaves were distinct, while the Fold 3’s photo of the same was muddy.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="85112f27-8afc-479c-8b5f-3a172359d3c9"/><p>That’s a small gripe, though. The Fold 3’s rear cameras are otherwise comparable to their conventionally shaped counterparts. The selfie sensor also delivered pleasantly crisp, vibrant photos.</p><p>My main complaint about photo or video quality would be with the UDC — and it’s a small one. You can clearly tell when using this to take selfies or chat with friends that it’s a lower-quality option. Details are less sharp and colors aren’t as saturated. Still, I don’t expect much from a 4-megapixel camera, especially not one that’s under a screen. This feels more like a last resort if you really must take a call with the Fold open and is just serviceable.</p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>Whether I was using the outside screen or the internal panel, the Fold 3 was mostly snappy. Its Snapdragon 888 processor with 12GB of RAM delivered smooth performance as I marked dozens of emails as read, wrote a review while watching a video and Slacking my colleagues. I occasionally had to wait for an app to re-open when I switched between the two displays, but for the most part everything flew.</p><p>I also never found myself worrying about the Fold 3 running out of juice. It generally stuck around for at least a day and a half, sometimes only conking out after two days. I ran our video rundown test on the Fold 3’s larger screen and it clocked 14 hours and 3 minutes. The Surface Duo only lasted 10 hours and 32 minutes in a similar setup.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7243b550-0754-11ec-9fca-3bf7ca5ab8c0" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 laying open, flat on its back, on a window ledge." data-uuid="e5202088-1b98-3058-86d9-fd11f48eae8b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><h2><br>Wrap-up</h2><p>With the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Fold 3" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">Fold 3</a>, it feels like Samsung has tried extremely hard to make a foldable smartphone-tablet hybrid work. But while I found myself eagerly reaching for the Flip 3 when I was reviewing it, I struggled to find reasons to use the Fold 3. When it’s closed, it’s heavier and narrower than a regular phone. I only want to open it up for gaming and getting work done on my commute. For the times when I’m leaning back on my couch and want to idle away on Reddit or Twitter, the Fold 3 doesn’t satisfy. Maybe that’s a good thing, but I’m not here to debate the philosophical benefits of foldables.</p><p>I had a similar issue with the Surface Duo, which tried to be a tablet and a phone and failed at both. Though the Fold 3 is in most ways superior, it still won’t replace a regular smartphone. It’s a well-made, impressive piece of tech that has benefited from years of R&amp;D, but it suffers from an identity crisis by attempting to be two things at once. Does that mean the world should give up on foldable phones altogether? Absolutely not. As components get smaller, the Fold could one day be thin and light enough with much improved software that might make it useful in all its modes. But for now, despite all the progress Samsung has made, the Fold 3 is still not ready for the mainstream.</p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: Snapdragon 888 or 5nm 64-bit octa-core processor (2.84Ghz + 2.4GHz + 1.8GHz)</p><p><strong>RAM / Storage</strong>: 12GB with 256/512GB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Main display</strong>: 7.6-inch 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED Infinity Flex Display</p><p><strong>Main display resolution</strong>: 2,208 x 1,768 (22.5:18)</p><p><strong>External display</strong>: 6.2-inch 120Hz Dynamic AMOLED</p><p><strong>External display resolution</strong>: 2,268 x 832 (24.5:9)</p><p><strong>Rear triple cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.8 wide-angle camera with OIS and 83-degree FOV, 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (123-degree FOV), 12MP f/2.4 telephoto camera with OIS and 45-degree FOV</p><p><strong>Front camera</strong>: 10MP f/2.2 camera (80-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Inside (under-display) camera</strong>: 4MP f/1.8 camera (80-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: Android 11 with One UI</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: 4,400mAh</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: USB-C with fast wired charging at 25W (QC2.0 and AFC) and fast wireless charging at 10W (WPC and PMA).

Unfortunately, this time we were not successful.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In T-Mobile’s account of what happened, the individual who hacked the company’s IT systems used “specialized” tools and knowledge of its infrastructure to gain access to its testing environments. &quot;In short, this individual’s intent was to break in and steal data, and they succeeded,&quot; said Sievert.</p><p>The executive says the company is “fully committed” to improving its security practices as it works to regain the trust of its customers, many of whom had personal information like names, birth dates and social security numbers compromised in the incident. As a first step, T-Mobile has contacted “just about every” current customer or primary account holder who had data such as their name, SSN or address accessed. He also reiterated the company will offer two free years of access to McAfee’s ID Theft Protection Service to all of those affected by the incident.</p><p>Looking to the future, the carrier has signed multi-year partnerships with KPMG and cybersecurity firm Mandiant.

They’ve assisted scientists in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-harvard-ai-genomics-201226236.html"><ins>identifying genomic markers</ins></a> ripe for cutting-edge treatments, <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2020.00065/full"><ins>accelerating the discovery</ins></a> of potent <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-14-how-ai-is-helping-halt-the-flu-of-the-future.html"><ins>new drugs</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-02-05-eve-robot-scientist-malaria.html"><ins>therapeutics</ins></a>, and even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-26-apple-publishes-first-ai-research-paper.html"><ins>publishing their own research</ins></a>. Throughout this period, however, AI/ML systems have often been relegated to simply processing large data sets and performing brute force computations, not leading the research themselves.</p><p>But Dr. Hiroaki Kitano, CEO of Sony Computer Science Laboratories, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-021-00189-3"><ins>has plans for a</ins></a> “hybrid form of science that shall bring systems biology and other sciences into the next stage,” by creating an AI that’s just as capable as today’s top scientific minds. To do so, Kitano seeks to launch the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/going-digital/ai-intelligent-machines-smart-policies/conference-agenda/ai-intelligent-machines-smart-policies-kitano.pdf"><ins>Nobel Turing Challenge</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-021-00189-3"><ins>develop a AI smart enough to win itself a Nobel Prize by 2050</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The distinct characteristic of this challenge is to field the system into an open-ended domain to explore significant discoveries rather than rediscovering what we already know or trying to mimic speculated human thought processes,” Kitano <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41540-021-00189-3"><ins>wrote in June</ins></a>. “The vision is to reformulate scientific discovery itself and to create an alternative form of scientific discovery.”</p><p>“The value lies in the development of machines that can make discoveries continuously and autonomously,” he added, “AI Scientist will generate-and-verify as many hypotheses as possible, expecting some of them may lead to major discoveries by themselves or be a basis of major discoveries. A capability to generate hypotheses exhaustively and efficiently verify them is the core of the system.”</p><p>Today’s AIs are themselves the result of decades of scientific research and experimentation, starting back in 1950 when Alan Turing published his seminal treatsie, <a href="https://www.csee.umbc.edu/courses/471/papers/turing.pdf"><em><ins>Computing Machinery and Intelligence</ins></em></a>. Over the years, these systems have grown from laboratory curios to vital data processing and analytical tools — but Kitano wants to take them a step further, effectively creating “a constellation of software and hardware modules dynamically interacting to accomplish tasks,” what he calls an “AI Scientist.”</p><p>“Initially, it will be a set of useful tools that automate a part of the research process in both experiments and data analysis,” he told Engadget. “For example, laboratory automation at the level of a closed-loop system rather than isolated automation is one of the first steps. A great example of this is <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017APS..MARX49001K/abstract"><ins>Robot Scientist Adam-Eve</ins></a> developed by Prof. Ross King that automatically generates hypotheses on budding yeast genetics, plan experiments to support or refute, and execute experiments.”</p><div id="2cb7bd7824344a97829b2df33c3b9fdb"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LQaKoM5YGXk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>“Gradually, the level of autonomy may increase to generate a broader range of hypotheses and verification,” he continued. “Nevertheless, it will continue to be a tool or a companion for human scientists at least within the foreseeable future.”</p><p>By having an AI Scientist handle the heavy intellectual lifting involved in generating hypotheses to explore, their human counterparts would have more free time to focus on research strategies and decide which hypotheses to actually look into, Kitano explained.</p><p>As always, avoiding the <a href="https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/f9kuryi8/release/6"><ins>Black Box Effect</ins></a> and implicit bias (both in the software’s design and the data sets it is trained on) will be of paramount importance to establishing and maintaining trust in the system — the residents of Dr. Moreau’s island wouldn’t have been any less miserable had he been a mad AI instead of a mad geneticist.</p><p>“For scientific discoveries to be accepted in the scientific community, they must be accompanied with convincing evidence and reasoning behind them,” Kitano said. “AI Scientists will have components that can explain the mechanisms behind their discoveries. AI Scientists that do not have such explanation capabilities will be less preferred than ones [that do].”</p><p>Some of history&#39;s greatest scientific discoveries — from radiation and the microwave to Teflon and the pacemaker — have all come from experimental screwups. But <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2017/07/31/facebook-ai-creates-its-own-language-in-creepy-preview-of-our-potential-future/"><ins>when hyper-intelligent AIs start devising their own inscrutable spoken language</ins></a>, researchers rush to pull the plug. So what happens if and when an AI Scientist makes a discovery or <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ai-designs-quantum-physics-experiments-beyond-what-any-human-has-conceived/"><ins>devises an experiment</ins></a> that humans cannot immediately understand, even with an explanation?</p><p>“When AI Scientists get sophisticated enough to handle complex phenomena, there are chances to discover things that are not immediately understood by human scientists,” Kitano admitted. “Theoretically, there is a possibility that someone can run highly autonomous AI Scientists without restrictions and [not caring] if their discovery is understandable. However, this may come with a large price tag and one has to justify it. When such an AI Scientist is recognized to make important scientific discoveries already, I am certain there will be guidelines for operation to ensure safety and to prevent misuse.”</p><p>The advent of an AI Scientist able to work alongside human researchers could also lead to some sticky questions as to who should be credited with the discoveries made — is it the AI that generated the hypothesis and ran the experiment, the human that oversaw the effort, or the academic institution/corporate entity that owns the operation? Kitano points to a recent decision <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-01/historic-decision-allows-ai-to-be-recognised-as-an-inventor/100339264"><ins>by an Australian court</ins></a> that recognized <a href="https://artificialinventor.com/dabus/"><ins>the DABUS “artificial neural system”</ins></a> as an inventor for patent applications as one example.</p><p>Conversely, Kitano notes the case of Satoshi Nakamoto and his inventions of blockchain and bitcoin. “There is a case where a decisive contribution was simply published as a blogpost and taken seriously,” he argues, “yet no one ever met him and his identity (at the time of writing) is a complete mystery.”</p><p>“If a developer of an AI Scientist was determined to create a virtual persona of a scientist with an <a href="https://orcid.org/"><ins>ORCID iD</ins></a>, for demonstration of technological achievement, product promotion, or for another motivation,” he continued, “iit would be almost impossible to distinguish between the AI and human scientist.” But if a truly groundbreaking medical advancement comes from this challenge — say, a cure for cancer or nanobot surgeons — does it really matter if it was a human or a machine running the experiment?</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonys-head-of-ai-research-wants-to-build-robots-that-can-win-a-nobel-prize-180059012.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0cbcd62a-0908-4ae5-91c1-be8c594edd4b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 18:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630083673</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T17:01:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4a808000-0756-11ec-a3ff-b61c862ec370" width="8114" height="5088" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4a808000-0756-11ec-a3ff-b61c862ec370" width="8114" height="5088" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[metamorworks via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Medical technology concept.

It quickly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-preview-system-requirements-202709366.html">reversed course</a>, saying that more people could install the software update than its requirements originally stated so the company could gather more performance on how the OS performed. After a few months of users testing and providing feedback, <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/08/27/update-on-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-and-the-pc-health-check-app/">Microsoft says that</a>, for the most part, its system requirements from June will stand — but there are a few notable changes.</p><p>This means that you&#39;ll need a compatible 64-bit processor, 4GB of memory and 64GB of storage, as well as &quot;UEFI secure boot, graphics requirements and TPM 2.0.&quot; For the most part, Microsoft is still requiring an 8th-generation or newer Intel processor, but the company is adding a few 7th-generation Intel options to the supported list, including Intel Core X-series, Xeon W-series and the Intel Core 7820HQ. For the latter, Microsoft will only support &quot;select devices that shipped with modern drivers based on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/develop/dch-principles-best-practices#dch-design-principles">Declarative, Componentized, Hardware Support Apps (DCH) </a>design principles, including Surface Studio 2.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>After working with AMD, Microsoft has declined to include the first generation of AMD Zen processors in its officially supported list. The full list of supported processors can be found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/minimum/windows-processor-requirements">here</a>.</p><p>There is some good news for people running older hardware, though. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22644194/microsoft-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-processors-changes">According to <em>The Verge</em></a>, Microsoft won&#39;t prohibit computers running processors on its &quot;supported&quot; list from installing Windows 11 — they just won&#39;t be able to do so through the official Windows update software. You&#39;ll instead have to download a Windows 11 ISO file and install it yourself. <em>The Verge</em> says this method will primarily be for businesses to try Windows 11 and it won&#39;t be publicizing this method to standard users.&nbsp;</p><p>If you&#39;re still wondering whether or not your computer will be able to officially run Windows 11, Microsoft has released an update for its PC Health Check, which was originally giving users some rather vague and unhelpful messages regarding compatibility. The new version should make it much clearer whether your computer is supported and, if not, what it needs to meet the Windows 11 system requirements.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-windows-11-supported-processors-update-175544403.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cb35254b-1e7e-42f9-855d-60ca218a7978</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 17:55:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630086946</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T17:55:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bafe48f0-075e-11ec-b37f-1e7e0f652653" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/bafe48f0-075e-11ec-b37f-1e7e0f652653" width="2000" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft releases an improved Windows 11 PC health check app]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Workers say they've collected almost 500 toxic workplace stories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-workers-201202748.html">sending out a call to action</a> on Monday, #AppleToo, a group made up of current and former Apple workers looking to shine a light on the company’s workplace culture, says it has collected nearly 500 stories of incidents involving discrimination, harassment and retaliation “that happened at the hands of a colleague off of campus.” According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/AppleLaborers/status/1431274019878158339?s=20">Apple Workers Twitter account</a>, the majority of those who got in touch asked for information on how to file a complaint with an external authority like the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH).</p><div id="69be1e8ca7884e8bb830ad5f57658665"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">So far, we&#39;ve received nearly 500 responses, and hundreds of stories of racism, sexism, discrimination, retaliation, bullying, sexual and other forms of harassment, and sexual assault that happened at the hands of a colleague off of campus. <br><br>The main thread?

If you’re the type of person who’s prone to misplacing their belongings, accessory maker Spigen might have something that could help. As spotted by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/spigen-s-airpods-pro-case-straps-an-apple-airtag-tracke-1847570223"><em><ins>Gizmodo</ins></em></a>, the company has released the <a href="https://fave.co/3Bhz2d9"><ins>Tag Armor Duo</ins></a>, a $34.99 case that protects your AirPods Pro case while including a slot for an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-29-each-find-my-item-tracker-comning-april-30-171736127.html">AirTag</a>.</p><p>Spigen isn’t the first accessory maker to make something like this, but the company’s solution has a certain elegance to it. Not only is there a built-in slot for Apple’s lost item tracker, but it also comes with a handy carabiner on the side and a cutout on the bottom to leave the Lightning port unobstructed. You also don’t have to take the case off to charge your AirPods Pro wirelessly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At $64 for both the case and a single AirTag, Spigen’s Tag Armor Duo isn’t exactly a cheap option. It’s also worth pointing out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-code-leak-airpods-apple-id-114508704.html"><ins>iOS 15</ins></a> will include a feature that will allow the AirPods Pro to connect to Apple’s Find My network over Bluetooth. Still, if you want the most peace of mind possible, you could do worse than the Tag Armor Duo. With an AirTag attached to your AirPods Pro case, you can use the U1 chip on a recent iPhone to find the case using an ultra-wideband connection. That allows you to take advantage of Apple’s Precision Finding feature to make locating it easier. The tag also includes a speaker so it can ring to let you know where it is.&nbsp;</p><p>You can buy the Tag Armor Duo from Spigen&#39;s website and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3BhSlDo">Amazon</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spigen-tag-armor-duo-airpods-pro-case-153429195.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">30001400-c6ce-4016-baad-84e2b448cd73</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 15:34:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630078472</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T15:34:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab0eb3f0-0748-11ec-9fa6-2a7ff13685d4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab0eb3f0-0748-11ec-9fa6-2a7ff13685d4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spigen]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spigen Tag Armor Duo]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spigen Tag Armor Duo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Latest ‘Metroid Dread’ gameplay trailer shows off new moves and a new enemy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-metroid-dread-release-date-163036346.html">surprise-announced <em>Metroid Dread</em></a><em>, </em>the fifth mainline game in the series, at E3 this year. Part of the surprise was that it was arriving this year, October 8th to be precise. Now, with just over a month before it arrives, Nintendo has released a new trailer for <em>Metroid Dread, </em>which might be our last look at the game before launch. Of course, this trailer isn&#39;t as detailed as the 20 minutes of gameplay Nintendo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-preview-e3-130020326.html">showed off at E3</a>, but it still shows off a lot of what to expect when <em>Metroid Dread</em> arrives on the Switch.&nbsp;</p><div id="8e7f577737664dfd966b5b7ab72ccb2e"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_XnbTayTH4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The video mixes more cinematic shots of Samus Aran battling some pretty huge and intimidating baddies with the 2D gameplay footage that originally defined the series before the first-person <em>Metroid Prime</em> games. The game looks immediately familiar to people who&#39;ve been waiting for a new 2D Metroid game, but Samus Aran has more abilities to navigate the terrain and battle enemies than ever before. The trailer moves fast, but there&#39;s lots of aerial dashing, underwater action, multiple different arm cannon weapons, wall jumping and more.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Given that this is the first all-new, side-scrolling Metroid game since 2002&#39;s <em>Metroid Fusion </em>for the Game Boy Advance (!), <em>Dread</em> has a lot to live up to. But at least from what we&#39;ve seen so far, Nintendo may have pulled off the feat of bringing one of its oldest franchises into the modern era of gaming. We&#39;ll find out in just over a month.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-switch-gameplay-trailer-145519457.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">079b84ad-edd6-4c63-9111-7838f3ef9639</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 14:55:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630076123</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T14:55:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/032033f0-0746-11ec-b7de-d982f8e89fec" width="1750" height="1054" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/032033f0-0746-11ec-b7de-d982f8e89fec" width="1750" height="1054" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Metroid Dread gameplay]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla applies to become an energy supplier in Texas]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Tesla began building a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-battery-farm-angelton-texas-204329254.html">secretive 100-megawatt energy storage project</a> in Angleton, Texas, a town some 40 miles south of Houston, there were questions about what the company planned to do with the facility.

But lately I’ve wanted to change it up and do some writing that flexes different parts of my brain: things like short stories, essays or even a longer fiction piece.</p><p>But since I’m a tech nerd at heart, I couldn’t help but start thinking about new software or gadgets I could use to optimize my pursuit. I started using my favorite writing app, Bear, on the iPad Pro. I had read that minimizing distractions while writing can be crucial to making headway – and though my job means I’m almost always multitasking while writing, the luxury of my new hobby is that I can take the time to truly focus. But all those notifications and distracting apps lurk right beneath the surface, testing my resolve to actually sit down and get into the zone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, I caught wind of a new product from a company called Astrohaus, the “Hemingwrite,” a <a href="https://hemingwrite.com/">limited-edition version</a> of a device that Astrohaus <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-23-freewrite-smart-typewriter-launch.html">has sold for about five years</a>. <a href="https://getfreewrite.com/products/freewrite-smart-typewriter">The Freewrite</a> (and the Hemingwrite edition, which is already sold out) combines an excellent mechanical keyboard with an e-ink display and is meant purely for drafting text. There aren’t even arrow keys, so editing anything more than a few words back is a non-starter. It has WiFi, so you can sync your drafts to Dropbox, Google Drive or Evernote, but that’s about the only concession it makes to the internet age.</p><p>My colleague Kris Naudus tried the Freewrite Traveler last year. As the name implies, it’s a portable version of the Freewrite with a clamshell, laptop-like design and a standard laptop-style keyboard. She <a href="https://www.engadget.com/astrohaus-freewrite-traveler-eink-typewriter-review-130000032.html">did not love it</a>, mostly because of the refresh rate on the e-ink screen.</p><p>The Traveler held  little appeal to me, but the full-size Freewrite wormed its way into my mind. It’s expensive at $600, but it’s a beautiful machine with an aesthetic that spoke to me. I imagined starting my day with a large cup of coffee and the Freewrite, banging out my thoughts for an hour every morning before starting my work day. With my phone silenced, good music on my headphones and a blank page in front of me, I’d surely get into the writing flow.</p><div id="ce87b14a1c6841dfa200bce6c2f051f7"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlLULToutEk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>By the beginning of August, I had decided to try the Freewrite for a month and see if it was a useful tool for me. My first impression of the Freewrite hardware was that it looked just as striking in person as it does online. The main chassis is a dark gray aluminum, while the underside is a bright white soft-touch plastic that matches the white keycaps. The e-ink screen is a little under five inches wide and a bit over two and a half inches tall. There’s also a smaller thin strip of a screen below that displays things like word count, a clock, a timer or the sync status of your drafts.</p><p>Flanking that screen are two pleasantly chunky physical switches: one for controlling WiFi settings and another to move between three different folders that drafts are saved in. The last button wakes up the Freewrite when you’re ready to go. Like the two switches, this button just feels great to press. At a time when so many of our devices try to do so many things, there’s something pleasant about a beautiful piece of hardware designed to do one thing well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4a098c00-073a-11ec-bbf7-7b3868ac997f" alt="Astrohaus Freewrite" data-uuid="07d8c2a6-572c-3b08-a4db-c15fa69bbbb8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Right away, I noticed the learning curve. For me, it was a combination of the mechanical keyboard and e-ink screen. Those are both two of the main selling points for the device, and they’re each very different from what I’m used to. After years of using thin laptop keyboards, the mechanical keyboard tripped me up a bit; my accuracy and speed were not the finest. Given the lack of a cursor and arrow keys, I tried to train myself to blast past small typos rather than delete words to go back and fix them.</p><p>This is just what the Freewrite’s creators intended. This isn’t a device for editing your thoughts, just for getting them out as quickly and efficiently as possible. Fine-tuning can happen later, on a laptop. It took some time to get used to this approach, and I still often find myself stopping to go back and fix small mistakes, but I can definitely appreciate the benefit of moving forward with whatever I’m writing rather than getting hung up on the details.</p><p>The e-ink screen presents its own challenges and benefits. I was originally worried about its size, but that turned out not to be an issue. You can adjust the text size, but the default setting let me see plenty of my draft. I’d occasionally have to page up a bit to refresh my memory on what I was working on, but it honestly never felt too cramped.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c109b820-073a-11ec-b5f6-27581732db28" alt="Astrohaus Freewrite" data-uuid="cfcd262b-86f9-33c8-a00e-4de88b49eda9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s sharp, clear and looks great with or without the light activated. I tried to train myself to write by natural light, and most of the time I found the built-in front-light (again similar to the Kindle) unnecessary. It’s still good to have you prefer working in darker conditions, but I try to do most of my work in a well-lit room.</p><p>If you’ve ever used a Kindle, you know the big downside of e-ink screens: the refresh rate. It’s not as big an issue on a Kindle, where you flip the page every 30 seconds or so, but on a typing device the screen is updating constantly. It’s far different than the instant feedback you get when typing on a traditional computer, and I can absolutely see how it would be off-putting to some people.</p><p>It’s worth taking the time to get used to, though. Most experienced typists probably don’t need to watch every single character appear; I just tried to type and get into a flow and only really pay attention to the screen when I wanted to go back and read something. In my mind, I think the trade-off between a traditional LCD screen here is worth it. We have more than enough blue-light screens in our lives.</p><p>Another benefit of the e-ink display is that it means the battery life is measured in weeks, not hours (yup, like the Kindle). I’ve been using the Freewrite pretty heavily over the last month and I think I’ve given it a full charge twice. Astrohaus says it’s rated to run for four weeks with 30 minutes of daily usage. My sessions were usually longer but less frequent; I definitely didn’t hit four weeks between charges, though. Regardless, unless you use the device for multiple hours every day, you shouldn’t have to worry about running out of juice.</p><p>Overall, I’d say the hardware delivers what Astrohaus promises. But I’m not trying to review this like an iPad or other modern gadgets. For me, the question has been whether this thing will help me become a more disciplined writer, and if it is better suited to that task than other tools at my disposal.</p><div id="aaf3cce57aff4349838eb4cfc5dce3e1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trying something a little different lately.

Aside from this story and one other, everything else I’ve created on the Freewrite has been words I would not have written if I wasn’t trying to write creatively.</p><p>Of course, that’s not to say I couldn’t have done the same thing with my iPad, a laptop, or various other gadgets. From that perspective, it’s hard to spend $600 on a Freewrite, as it doesn’t offer any truly new features compared to a laptop.</p><p>But, in the same way that a Kindle, Nintendo Switch or a high-end digital camera are better for specific purposes than a smartphone or iPad, the Freewrite is optimized for its singular purpose better than other options. Because the hardware is so gorgeous and easy to use, I found myself wanting to pull it out – it has been a positive reinforcement tool that has helped me build my habit.</p><p>That said, I still have to have the discipline to use it and block out potential distractions. If I set up with a laptop on my desk while trying to write with the Freewrite, I’m just screwing myself.</p><p>That’s why the Freewrite hasn’t been an essential tool for my work. Even on days when I need to get writing done, I’m often multitasking, keeping an eye on our Slack channel and the news in a broader sense. I realize this doesn’t make for an optimal writing environment, but it’s the reality of being an online journalist.</p><p>Practically speaking, I’m often flipping between my writing and a browser for research or another document with notes on my piece. There simply aren&#39;t a lot of stories that I work where I can just sit down and write uninterrupted. This story is one of them, though, and a workflow where I do my drafting on the Freewrite while also having my iPad handy for research, notes and an occasional Slack check has worked pretty well thus far.</p><p>There’s no way to quantify how much of this is due to the Freewrite and how much of it is simply me finding the willpower to start developing a new habit. People are creatures of habit, and I, too, enjoy a good ritual. I haven’t fully transformed my life where I can write uninterrupted every morning like I imagined, but I have found myself making more time for my new hobby. The other night, I had a few hours free after work, and instead of blowing them on video games, I worked on a story I’ve been writing – a small victory over my lowest impulses, but I still think it counts.</p><p>Lately, I find myself waking up thinking about when I can squeeze in 30 minutes or an hour of writing time without the distractions of news and work, and the Freewrite is my first choice for that. It’s a joy to type on, and it’s a prime example of hardware that just gets out of your way and lets you focus on the task at hand. There’s no doubt that it’s an expensive device, and one that is more limited than a comparably priced laptop. It’s a luxury, but for a specific type of person, it might also end up being an invaluable tool for your work. For me, it&#39;s been a great help in fostering a new hobby. It&#39;s not an essential tool, but it&#39;s something that makes me want to write more when I&#39;m not, and something that makes me want to keep writing when I am using it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/astrohaus-freewrite-one-month-writing-test-140008132.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9ee2bdb-d55b-4207-8b98-b192c073be7c</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 14:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630073454</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T14:11:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" width="2000" height="1234" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" width="2000" height="1234" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Freewrite standalone word processor with keyboard sits on an office desktop.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Freewrite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MacBook Air M1 drops back down to $850 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We rarely see the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3DnXCLq">MacBook Air M1</a> drop below $900, but that&#39;s the case today on Amazon. Apple&#39;s thin-and-light laptop is on sale for $850 right now, or $150 off its normal price.

The notebook wakes almost instantly when you open the lid, native apps run super smoothly and the machine as a whole is impressively responsive. You&#39;re also able to run iOS apps with the M1 chip, which is a fun feature to have. Graphics performance is noteworthy, too: MacBook Airs have not been gaming machines in the past, and we probably still wouldn&#39;t use it to run intense titles, but it performed well while playing Apple Arcade games and even <em>Fortnite</em>. And since the laptop doesn&#39;t have a fan inside, it&#39;ll be much quieter than most previous Apple laptops you may have had.</p><p>Our biggest complaints about the MacBook Air M1 are its paltry 720p webcam and its limit of two USB-C ports. While living the dongle life can get frustrating, it&#39;s a small price to pay for an otherwise stellar laptop that can handle most things you&#39;ll through at it.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-sale-150-off-amazon-131724416.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d17084bb-0130-4860-8445-f6ac1e48db57</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 13:17:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630070274</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T13:17:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Keychron's Q1 keyboard is its most customizable yet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The humble computer keyboard might feel utilitarian, but given it’s the part of your setup you interact with the most, it’s kinda wild that we don&#39;t often give it thought. Fortunately, there’s a vibrant scene of small (and not so small) companies that understand everyone’s needs are different and that getting the right size, shape and ergonomic layout can upgrade your working or gaming life in significant ways. Keychron is one such company.</p><p>Keychron has earned a reputation for making affordable yet feature-rich <a href="https://www.engadget.com/favorite-gadgets-2020-irl-170055096.html">mechanical keyboards</a>, and <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1">the Q1</a> (starting at $169) is the latest member of the family. The Q is a nod to <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a>, a popular open-source firmware that lets you customize compatible keyboards to your liking. It’s Keychron’s most ambitious deck yet, and a direct competitor to something like the <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black">GMMK Pro</a> or the <a href="https://kbdfans.com/collections/bella/products/bella?variant=34248579121291">KBDFans Bella</a>, both of which cost north of $250 depending on your preferred configuration.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Q1 is a 75-percent keyboard, which means there’s no number pad and the home cluster and arrow keys are placed a little more tightly compared to a tenkeyless deck (that gives those keys a little more space of their own). The Q1 is Mac- and Windows compatible and comes with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Connector-USB-Mini-Mechanical-Keyboards/dp/B087PMN84K/ref=pd_sbs_1/133-9064674-5838700?pd_rd_w=8r8OV&amp;pf_rd_p=3676f086-9496-4fd7-8490-77cf7f43f846&amp;pf_rd_r=12SZFYEKC6CPH8H1W0K5&amp;pd_rd_r=5b785581-4f8c-4ec1-937d-fc4cf27136fd&amp;pd_rd_wg=JHWQ1&amp;pd_rd_i=B087PMN84K&amp;psc=1">Aviator style USB-C</a> cable so that people know you really mean business. Alas, there’s no Bluetooth option here if that’s something you wanted.</p><p>As customization is the key here (no pun intended), it’s no surprise that the switches are hot-swappable. Keychron already offers a decent <a href="https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-keycap-collection-1">range of keycaps</a>, though you can of course grab your own if you have a preferred set already. If you already own switches you like, you can order the barebone deck and save $20. You can also choose from three aluminum case colors: black, navy and space gray. Both ANSI and ISO layouts are available depending on your preference (or, more likely, location).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6c08f540-0666-11ec-b97e-9411ce8b9690" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="3a5db443-b6f8-3573-9633-afa91ede38c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>One thing I love about all Keychron keyboards is that they not only come with a keycap puller tool and a switch remover tool (where applicable), but you’ll also get the keycaps for both Windows and MacOS layouts. This makes it easy for the company just to stock one SKU and possibly helps keep costs down. If, like me, you use both operating systems — you can then repurpose any of their keyboards without having to buy new caps later. Or worse, live with a CMD key when you want a Windows key or vice versa.</p><p>A fancy keyboard isn’t anything without RGB lighting, of course, and naturally, that’s included here too. Keychron opted for a more subtle “south-facing” integration, which pretty much means what you think: The lights are only visible from below. I don’t need or use RGB, so I tend to turn it off. The implementation here is subtle yet bright enough to still remain useful if it’s something you want.</p><p>For the more hardcore enthusiast, inside there’s a gasket-based design with a noise-reducing foam deck between that and the PCB. For those who really like to get into details, know that the stabilizers here are screw-in (rather than plate), which usually means the larger keys are steadier. There’s also the option for a customized metal “badge” where the Insert key would be. If you send Keychron a design, it’ll etch it onto that badge for you to make it truly personalized. There will also be an option to add a rotary dial here (much like on the GMMK Pro), or you can just switch it back to the Insert key if none of that tickles your fancy.</p><p>For all its changeable parts, arguably the most useful way to customize the Q1 is with the <a href="https://caniusevia.com/">Via app</a>, or with the aforementioned QMK. (Via is basically a graphical interface for the latter.) With Via you can reassign any key to pretty much anything else as well as design and assign macros to the function layer (i.e., press Fn and a target key to trigger more complex key combinations). More on this later.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cfd81b00-0666-11ec-b5f7-4c05c07fad59" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="28ee6b48-f727-36a1-8350-c3beac9f48ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>With all this talk about gaskets and stabilizers, it might seem that the Q1 is designed for advanced users. And it certainly will appeal to those with specific requirements. But Keychron’s popularity, in my opinion, is born out of making the geeky and exotic accessible to the normies out there. The Q1, then, is perhaps marketed toward those who have dabbled with mechanical keyboards and want to dip a toe into deeper waters, while still offering enough for the avid keyboard tinkerers.</p><p>That said, the first thing you’ll want to do with the Q1 when you take it out of the box is… put it down. At 3.5 pounds (1.6kg) it’s definitely on the chunky side. For context, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Bluetooth-Mechanical-Keyboard-Wireless-Keyboard/dp/B07QBPCGY2/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=keychron+k2&amp;qid=1629893215&amp;sr=8-3">Keychron’s K2</a> wireless keyboard has a  similar footprint but is a svelte 1.5 pounds (663g) — less than half the weight. The Q1 isn’t really designed for portability, though, so that extra heft just glues it to your desk and makes you feel more confident that this isn’t going to rattle itself apart as you bash out fanfic/code/school essays on it. The weight is also pretty standard for this category.</p><p>The model I was able to test came pre-installed with Gateron brown switches. Before then I had been using Gateron reds but I’m an instant convert. Of course, the very point of the Q1 is that you can put in whatever switches you like. Keychron also included a set of blue switches, which I used to test out how easy it was to swap ‘em out. Not only was that process pretty easy (once you get used to the very firm pull required to get them out), but I found myself fond enough of the blues for certain keys that I left them in. They’re generally a little too loud for my taste to have across the board, but being able to mix things up that way is the very spirit of customizable keyboards like these.</p><p>On that theme of noise… for me that was one of the bigger turn-offs for mechanical keyboards. Until I experimented myself, my main exposure to them was hearing someone across the office frantically clacking their way through an email. This is why I gravitated toward red switches at first. On the Q1, though, even something clicky like a blue switch isn’t too audible thanks to the gasket design and the foam insert on the Q1. Even the noisier switch flavors won’t alert your neighbors to your frantic typing during the small hours. If, like my former officemate, you are unencumbered by such worries, know that the same design makes for a keyboard with comfortable flex, giving it a much smoother action than plate-based designs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/85c39120-0666-11ec-bfd7-6d15c7bb7329" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="7d5d0010-f16e-3e96-8c62-3e03ec6b6dca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As alluded to earlier, though, perhaps one of the more exciting features here for those looking to take their keyboard customization to the next level is the support for VIA/QMK firmware noodling. If you get tired of doing the same convoluted keyboard shortcuts for regular tasks (like Windows’ Ctrl+Win+Arrow combo to switch between desktops), this is for you.</p><p>I already mentioned you can pretty much map any key to another. So if you wanted to swap Z and X around… you could. More usefully, you can also change which keys control media etcetera. Out of the box, the Q1 uses the standard “Fn+F10” combo to mute audio. My stubby fingers found this a little unnatural, so I used Via to remap it to Fn+Left Arrow. Much more manageable for my typing style.</p><p>Taking things a bit further, you can also enter much more complicated key combinations with macros. An explanation of this is beyond the scope of this article, but as an example, I was able to set up a simple key combo to launch one of my favorite chat apps. This was more of an experiment for someone who hasn’t done anything remotely like programming in a number of years. You’ll need to do some reading up to figure out how to tell a macro what to do, but once you have (and it’s really not that hard), you’ll find yourself thinking of evermore clever ideas.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fec336c0-0666-11ec-8efa-fa48fb8d4993" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="9ebde6c5-c863-37d7-98b9-1508def46dba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Some keyboards, like the GMMK Pro, offer their own software for customization. You can generally expect these apps to be a little more tightly integrated with the makers’ products, but VIA is easy enough to use that you can get most things done without much hassle.</p><p>Support for VIA/QMK is far from unique to the Q1: The GMMK Pro and KDBFans Bella both offer it too, along with many other customizable keyboards. But considering the price of the Q1, it rounds out an impressive spec sheet making it both a very accessible yet technically capable choice.</p><p>Some potential buyers might lament the lack of wireless connectivity, or the fact you can’t adjust its height (it measures just shy of two inches/45mm at the back). But both of these things are fairly standard for barebones and customizable keyboards. The fact that you can configure pretty much anything else to your liking makes this a great entry into the world of barebones keyboards at a price that’s very competitive.</p><p>The Q1 is available now directly from Keychron starting at $169. The rotary dial add-on will come in the following weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/keychron-q-1-fully-customizable-keyboard-130015959.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b0f96be6-d9a9-4bee-a9f7-c4fcb0d234c2</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 13:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630076618</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T15:03:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/196541e0-0666-11ec-be5e-e314ca333cd9" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/196541e0-0666-11ec-be5e-e314ca333cd9" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer's Blade 15 Advanced is $900 off in Amazon's one-day sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is ushering in the weekend with a one-day-only sale on a bunch of Razer laptops and gaming accessories.

That feature has been around since 2019, but it was switched on for all Cosmos DB customers just this past February.
