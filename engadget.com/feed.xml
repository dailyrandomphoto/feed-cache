And what a year it’s been, with new installments in storied franchises, remakes of forgotten classics and a game where you date your sword. As is tradition, the Engadget team gathered together to ruminate on their favorite titles released this year, extolling their virtues and sometimes drawbacks, but mostly explaining why we like them so much. We’ve also thrown in a few of our older faves that we played in 2021, because hey, a good game is always a good game. (Also, it helps when there are updates.)</p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Age of Empires IV" href="https://amzn.to/3F7RTcU">Age of Empires IV</a></h2><div id="58cec81d041f468fa8f75c6677385e13"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTaCrP_U4ao?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>When people look back at Microsoft’s 2021, they’ll cite <em>Halo: Infinite</em> and the extra year the company gave 343 Industries to work on the game as one of its best recent decisions. But I think the company also deserves praise for taking a chance on Relic and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-21-age-of-empires-4-in-development.html"><em>Age of Empires IV</em></a><em>.</em></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Coming off the dismal <em>Dawn of War III, </em>fans had every right to be skeptical of whether the studio could pull off a sequel to one of the most-loved real-time strategy games in history. Relic had a nearly impossible task before it. And yet it found a way to respect the history and roots of the series while pushing it forward in new and interesting ways. The star of the show here are the eight civilizations. Mechanically, they’re far more unique than the factions you could play as in past games. Each has a handful of twists that make them fun to learn and interesting to play against. The studio also changed how you move between the ages to present the player with interesting choices.</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AoE4" href="https://amzn.to/3F7RTcU"><em>AoE4</em></a> isn’t perfect, but neither was <em>Age of Empires II </em>before its Age of Conquerors expansion. More than anything, I’m excited to see where Relic takes the series should Microsoft give the studio the chance to continue working on the series. — <em>Igor Bonifacic, Contributing Editor</em></p><h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/674930/Boyfriend_Dungeon/">Boyfriend Dungeon</a></h2><div id="621502e024b64a03beab5a79377a6cc8"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wOhVJuN_3Ao?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><em>Boyfriend Dungeon</em> is a perfect blend of sword-swinging action and insatiable horniness — but not, like, in a gross way. This is the dungeon crawler of your middle-school daydreams, offering eye candy in a variety of forms and art styles, plus a mall packed with monsters to slay. And sales! But mostly monsters.</p><p>Everything about <em>Boyfriend Dungeon</em> is playful, from the cell phone messaging system, to the bright character customization options and the library of &#39;zines that serve as power-ups. The most charming aspect of the game, though, is the arsenal of flirty, dateable weapons. Players, <em>ahem</em>, forge relationships with the personalities behind the blades and then bring them into battle, choosing which combat style (or dating tactic) feels right in the moment. Combat itself is fast-paced yet adorable, with TV sets, flying VHS tapes, bats and phones attacking from every corner of the mall. There are also opportunities for small dates in between the battles, keeping the hormonal vibes alive.</p><p>Not only do you get to date your weapons in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/674930/Boyfriend_Dungeon/"><em>Boyfriend Dungeon</em></a>, but they’re all gorgeous and charming in their own way. Best of all, they’re not limited by the old-school definition of a <em>boy</em>friend. There’s a sword for nearly every play style here. <em>Wink</em>. — <em>Jessica Conditt, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Deathloop" href="https://amzn.to/3IQ6BaT">Deathloop</a></h2><div id="6f697b21fc8c4b0b8f35d52c7d65a9ee"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mc2hz3LJhTY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>To say I love Arkane Studio&#39;s <em>Dishonored</em> series is an understatement. I&#39;ve spent countless hours extolling the virtues of that series&#39; slick stealth gameplay, gorgeous steampunk art design and inventive level design. While the first game was successful enough to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-15-dishonored-2-has-a-good-reason-to-play-its-new-game-plus-mode.html">spawn a sequel</a> and a<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-26-dishonored-death-of-the-outsider.html"> standalone entry</a>, <em>Dishonored </em>never reached the massive mainstream popularity it deserved. (You could <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-15-prey-2017-hands-on-preview.html">say the same for <em>Prey</em></a>, another critical darling that sold poorly.)</p><p>Since we first saw a glimpse of <em>Deathloop</em>, it looked like an intriguing remix of some of <em>Dishonored&#39;s</em> best components. There were magical powers that let you teleport at will. It was a first-person stealth game that leaned heavily on both melee weapons and guns; and it looked absolutely beautiful. Personally, I was hoping that Arkane would be able to recreate the magic of <em>Dishonored</em> to make it more palatable to general players.</p><p>Well, <em>Deathloop</em> isn&#39;t that. Its time loop mechanics are hard to parse at first — in particular, it takes a while to learn what you should actually be doing to make any sort of progress. Even dealing with the game&#39;s menus can be migraine-inducing, especially when you&#39;re learning how to keep weapons between multiple loops.</p><p>But just like my colleague <a href="https://www.engadget.com/deathloop-review-ps5-arkane-120139958.html">Jessica Conditt</a>, I loved every minute of it. It’s a blast to play, so long as you’re attuned to its stealth mechanics. I seriously dug the multiplayer mode, which puts you in the shoes of the game’s main antagonist, Julianna, as she hunts down other players. It’s not as fleshed out as the single-player campaign, but it sure felt great ruining someone else’s loop.</p><p>While it&#39;s not quite the <em>Dishonored 3</em> I really want, I can&#39;t help but applaud Arkane for the sheer amount of innovation packed within <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Deathloop" href="https://amzn.to/3IQ6BaT"><em>Deathloop</em></a>. Sure, it&#39;s a time loop game like so many others; the day repeats itself like clockwork, and you&#39;re also pushed back to the beginning if you die. But, crucially, it also builds on that concept. If a similar temporal anomaly were discovered in our world, it likely wouldn&#39;t be too long before a bunch of elite technocrats started using it as a way to achieve something close to immortality. — <em>Devindra Hardawar, Senior Editor</em></p><h2><a href="https://playdeathsdoor.com/">Death’s Door</a></h2><div id="804acbe521dd485797b6e4747d79653e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D_tmwz-AhgQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/deaths-door-playstation-november-23-213345948.html"><em>Death’s Door</em></a> was the best game I played in 2021. And that’s not because it did something different. To me, someone who loved <em>Ocarina of Time </em>and <em>Majora’s Mask </em>growing up, its familiar and comforting Zelda-like rhythms were exactly what I needed in a challenging year. Everything about <a href="https://playdeathsdoor.com/"><em>Death’s Door</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is also perfect. From the music to the art style and gameplay, developer Acid Nerve has crafted one of the best adventures in recent memory. — <em>I.B.</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Famicom Detective Club" href="https://amzn.to/3DUBgAe">Famicom Detective Club</a></h2><div id="161c62a485354afcb4e19d899db0281b"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhWxF5LLR1U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>I’m a huge fan of visual novels — in my time at Engadget I’ve lauded games like <em>Doki Doki Literature Club</em> and <em>Dream Daddy</em> — so it’s no surprise that I enjoyed <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Famicom Detective Club" href="https://amzn.to/3DUBgAe">Famicom Detective Club</a> when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/famicom-detective-club-preview-nintendo-switch-130002504.html">I played the pair of re-released games for the Nintendo Switch</a> back in May.&nbsp;</p><p>The stories, particularly <em>The Missing Heir</em>, are compelling while the characters are easy to like. The gameplay is a little simple compared to the complexities of modern titles, but that just made me appreciate the genre more. I preferred the first game to the second, <em>The Girl Who Stands Behind</em>, but who am I kidding, you can’t play just one; they’re that fun. I hear that developer MAGES is willing to do a third installment, and I’d like to see where the series goes with a more modern spin. — <em>Kris Naudus, Buyer&#39;s Guide Editor</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Forza Horizon 5" href="https://amzn.to/3EQzxx7">Forza Horizon 5</a></h2><div id="f9a5576f1e064a8f93555de932948387"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FYH9n37B7Yw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>I’ve never been a huge fan of realistic racing games, mostly because of that one word: <em>realistic</em>. I don’t have the patience to tweak my car and master all the skills necessary to make the most out of those games. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/forza-horizon-5-preview-xbox-series-s-bronco-130028198.html"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>pulls off a great trick by making its racing <em>just</em> realistic enough while still being extremely approachable. The library of classic and modern vehicles means you can easily find your dream car(s), and the game makes it easy to auto-tune your collection for peak performance if you don&#39;t want to spend time picking out suspension systems, tires and so forth.</p><p>There’s also the brilliant “rewind” button: Taking tight corners at speed without wiping out (or going so slow around them that the entire field blows past you) is not easy, but rewinding means you can easily erase any big mistakes you make and take the corner all over again. It helped me learn faster than I would have if I ended up in last place every time I took a turn.</p><p>Beyond that, the world of <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> simply looks amazing — the beautifully-rendered jungles, mountains and open roads of this fictionalized corner of Mexico make for a perfect driving backdrop. It’s beautiful to look at, and the variety of terrain means you’ll get a huge variety of terrain in the different races to try.</p><p>In a year when I’ve shied away from the narrative-heavy, single-player games that I typically prefer, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Forza Horizon 5" href="https://amzn.to/3EQzxx7"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a> has been a perfect escape over the last few months. It’s the kind of game you can sink hours into at a time, or just pick up and play for a few races. And between the variety of race types, different weather conditions, weekly challenges and much more, it’s a game I think I’ll be coming back to for a long time. — <em>I.B.</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Halo Infinite" href="https://amzn.to/3GKmqOE">Halo Infinite</a></h2><div id="325a95c7a87247578b7ad166c3cf939c"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PyMlV5_HRWk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-review-campaign-xbox-microsoft-080158610.html">In my review of the <em>Halo Infinite</em> campaign</a>, I criticized the game for relying on tired narrative threads and repetitive mechanics. I found myself wanting more innovation out of a modern, open-world Halo, rather than a cramped map of overly familiar landscapes and a lineup of the best tricks taken from other successful franchises.</p><p>All of that remains true, but hey — it’s still Halo.</p><p>When it comes to gameplay, <em>Infinite </em>is the best Halo’s been. It doesn’t thrust the series forward in any significant way, but it spit-shines the best features and presents everything in a polished environment that’s perfectly suited for floaty, fast-paced gun battles. The campaign evokes your warm-fuzzy nostalgic feelings and, even though it may not feel like a massive open world, offers a larger area to explore than ever before.</p><p><em>Infinite</em>’s multiplayer matches benefit from the franchise improvements as well. There are tight and large-scale maps, a handful of new weapons with plenty of kick, and fan-favorite guns on offer like the Needler and Battle Rifle. This is the refreshing Halo experience we’ve been waiting (and <em>waiting</em>) for, driven by new tools like the Grappleshot, a hook that allows players to fly around the map like a short-range, hard sci-fi Spider-Man.</p><p>In comparison to other open-world action-adventure games and rapid-fire FPS titles, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Halo Infinite" href="https://amzn.to/3GKmqOE"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>doesn’t deliver anything particularly innovative, but it also doesn’t have any catastrophic failures. For a franchise in its 20th year, that’s a successful outcome. Especially in comparison to other Halo games, <em>Infinite</em> is an achievement that any fan should be happy to play. — <em>J.C.</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Marvel&#x002019;s Guardians of the Galaxy" href="https://amzn.to/3secBUS">Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</a></h2><div id="b6ea01f983b04fdc85ac6e2e2b441682"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oki56MQfiHI?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>After the disappointment of last year&#39;s <em>Avengers</em>, I went into <em>Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em> with low expectations. I&#39;ve rarely been so happy about being proved wrong.</p><p><em>Guardians </em>is a blast. The story zips along, taking the crew from one gorgeous, colorful alien environment to the next as they try to save their skins and, inevitably, the galaxy.</p><p>You can only play as Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord), though you&#39;re rarely without at least one of your companions. The crew retains the quippy, rapid-fire dialogue from James Gunn&#39;s films and the characters talk almost constantly. Thankfully, the writing&#39;s the strongest part of the game, with a solid slate of jokes and story-centric lines. There are also dialogue choices (much like in a Telltale game) that can affect how a level plays out.</p><p>Eidos-Montréal had the chance to create a Guardians story that’s distinct from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The characters look, sound and act different from the MCU crew. It was initially a little jarring given how much I enjoy James Gunn’s movies, but I quickly grew to love them.</p><p>Unfortunately, the combat isn&#39;t great. Quill&#39;s guns are woefully underpowered at first, so fights are more about managing the rest of the team&#39;s more impactful abilities. A power-up mechanic that brings the team together in a seemingly inspiring huddle is annoying, while some of the enemy encounters feel extraneous. Still, the rest of the experience was so enjoyable that the mediocre combat wasn’t too bothersome.</p><p>In a landscape dominated by massive, never-ending games, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Guardians of the Galaxy" href="https://amzn.to/3secBUS"><em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>is a refreshing throwback. It&#39;s a single-player adventure that tells a streamlined story with great attention to detail. Best of all, in certain areas where Quill can&#39;t fire his pistols, he&#39;ll point finger guns and make &quot;pew-pew&quot; noises. I never get tired of that. — <em>Kris Holt, Contributing Editor</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Metroid Dread" href="https://amzn.to/3dQjxPJ">Metroid Dread</a></h2><div id="0c3a5d7387c1485b82afa24d781efc47"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOvefm5U250?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>As the first all-new, side-scrolling Metroid adventure since 2002, <em>Metroid Dread </em>had a lot to live up to. Nintendo has experimented both successfully (Metroid Prime Trilogy) and unsuccessfully (<em>Metroid: Other M</em>) with the basic formula, but <em>Dread </em>returns the series to its roots while adding enough new gameplay elements to keep things fresh.</p><p>However, with a series that had been dormant this long, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-is-a-nintendo-essential-151014629.html">new things weren’t what drew me to the game</a>. I had never played a side-scrolling Metroid game all the way through, and this installment is a near-perfect modern interpretation of the “Metroidvania” genre the series helped invent. There’s lots of exploration, back-tracking, and new areas opening up when you get power-ups. It’s a simple formula executed with precision by developer MercurySteam.</p><p>The stealth elements, where Samus has to avoid detection from the powerful E.M.M.I. robots, are new to the series. Fortunately, they aren’t so frequent that they overpower the standard segments. And while they can be difficult, they’re not so tough that I ever got terribly frustrated – they’re <em>just</em> hard enough that finally getting the power you need to take down an E.M.M.I. is extremely satisfying.</p><p>The rest of the game is pretty classic Metroid, but the journey to regain all your lost powers, explore the varied worlds of <em>Dread</em> and take out truly epic boss monsters doesn’t feel like a retread at all. Instead, it reminded me of why Metroid is one of Nintendo’s most classic franchises. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Metroid Dread" href="https://amzn.to/3dQjxPJ"><em>Metroid Dread</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>showed Nintendo at its best of breathing new life into a series while still keeping it comfortingly familiar. — <em>Nate Ingraham, Deputy Editor</em></p><h2><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:New Pok&#xe9;mon Snap" href="https://amzn.to/3se0HKG">New Pokémon Snap</a></h2><div id="4c3c46d709cd4e14b6b62615e43b1d0e"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q2f-ivvGw0U?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Gamers have their holy grails, the titles they’ve love to see that may never get made, like <em>Half-Life 3</em> and an official English translation of <em>Mother 3</em>. For years, the Nintendo 64&#39;s <em>Pokémon Snap</em> was one of those games on that list; I certainly remember people begging for a Wii or DS version back when I worked at The Pokémon Company over a decade ago. (The original got released on Wii Shop, but that’s about it.) So the announcement of <em>New Pokémon Snap</em> was a welcome surprise from last year, and the finished game certainly delivered.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-pokemon-snap-nintendo-switch-release-date-april-30-140842000.html">classic rail-shooter gameplay is back</a>, but now with improved graphics. The Pokémon look amazing, and the ability to use motion controls really adds to the immersion. (Though I admittedly did get a bit motion sick.) I’m a fan of birdwatching, but not the best at bird photography. So <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:New Pok&#xe9;mon Snap" href="https://amzn.to/3se0HKG"><em>New Pokémon Snap</em></a> really scratched that itch, with all the fun of logging and collecting them.

On the way there, Alex survives an attack on her caravan, but she&#39;s stranded 500 miles from home and has to make her way back. What&#39;s more, Alex has been blind since birth.</p><p><em>The Vale </em>attempts to replicate how Alex experiences the world in being almost entirely audio-based. Even though it&#39;s a first-person game, the only visuals to speak of, other than menus, are floating particles that offer the player some sense of the 3D environments and provide some contextual details like time of day.</p><p>Unlike many other RPGs, which usually offer a map that&#39;s spilling over with places to go and things to do, everything the player does is based on what they hear. <em>The Vale</em> uses spatial audio (headphones are essential for this one) to help players navigate the space, find other characters to interact with and receive guidance from Alex&#39;s companion. The sound design and voice acting are terrific. I rarely felt unsure about where I was or what was happening, unless that’s intended by the developer. It&#39;s important to listen carefully during combat too, as you&#39;ll aim your shield and weapon in one of three directions, depending on where you think an attacker is.</p><p>For a game that puts such an emphasis on accessibility for blind and vision-impaired players, it&#39;s disappointing that there are no subtitles or control remapping options for others.

But when <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-expansion-pack-pricing-animal-crossing-dlc-143755599.html">Nintendo announced the 2.0 update</a> a few months ago I pretty much started to hyperventilate and I’ve been lightheaded ever since. Lots of long-requested features finally dropped, most notably the addition of a café, but also plenty of quality of life improvements. It’s almost like a whole new game in some ways, reinvigorating this nearly two-year-old title to the point where I’m playing daily again and I haven’t even tried all the new features.

The company introduced the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-clock-2-hands-on-price-specs-availability-040032727.html">modestly updated</a> Smart Clock 2 this year, and we first saw this deal in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-lenovo-smart-clock-2-bundled-with-a-smart-light-is-on-sale-for-25-right-now-135610566.html">early December</a> before it returned today.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/2055067/565706/9383?subId1=7&amp;subId2=retailevent2021&amp;subId3=CW-LSClock2bundle&amp;veh=aff&amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2Fseort%2F507060083%3F" id="654a7f06bf2a425d98faabd731e33875" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Walmart;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Lenovo Smart Clock 2 bundle at Walmart - $25</a><p>The design of the Smart Clock 2 is a bit different from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-03-lenovo-smart-clock-review.html">original</a> in that it has a wider base, but the four-inch screen size remains the same. Lenovo also moved the speakers to the front of the device, resulting in a larger chin underneath the display. It doesn&#39;t hinder the minimalist look of the smart clock, and since it also means the speakers now fire outwards, it should actually help the blaring noise of your alarm reach your ears regardless of the position of the clock in relation to your bed.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The biggest new feature on the Smart Clock 2 is that the screen can now double as a night light and you can swipe down on the display to enable it. You can still ask the Google Assistant to activate the night light, but the extra gesture makes it so you don&#39;t <em>have</em> to speak to get some extra light in the middle of the night. Otherwise, the Smart Clock 2 can do everything the original device can, including show weather forecasts, enable alarms, play music and control smart home devices. Lenovo also kept a camera out of the equation yet again, which will make the Smart Clock 2 a more appealing option for those who have no desire to video chat using the alarm on their bedside table.</p><p>We can&#39;t speak for the quality of the Lenovo smart light bulb that&#39;s included in the bundle, but we can say that it supports white and color options with adjustable temperature and brightness. In addition to the companion mobile app, you can control the bulb using the Google Assistant or Alexa — and we expect you may do so using the former quite a bit if you pick up this bundle. If you have a small room in your home that you want to make a bit smarter, this Lenovo bundle is a solid, inexpensive way to do that.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lenovo-smart-clock-2-smart-bulb-bundle-walmart-145507550.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">abfb54d9-4ca7-4747-91bc-a80d989ba569</guid><dc:creator>Engadget</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 24 Dec 2021 14:55:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640358191</ingested><modified>2021-12-24T15:03:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Engadget]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f32b1cf0-d5e8-11eb-bdff-625b9715e053" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f32b1cf0-d5e8-11eb-bdff-625b9715e053" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A gray Lenovo Smart Clock 2 on a wireless charging dock with its screen facing the camera.

Creator Homei Miyashita thinks of the device as less of a taste-at-home device, and more as a tool for food professionals, like chefs and sommeliers.</p><p>The prototype is, yes, a little icky, despite the hygienic film that can be treated between tastings. According to <em>Reuters</em>, Miyashita is already discussing spin-off applications for the spray tech, like applying pizza or chocolate flavors to a slice of toasted bread.

In a proposed class-action lawsuit, moderator Candie Frazier said that she has screened videos showing violence, school shootings, fatal falls and even cannibalism. &quot;Plaintiff has trouble sleeping and when she does sleep, she has horrific nightmares,&quot; the lawsuit states.</p><p>Compounding the problem, TikTok allegedly requires moderators to work 12-hour shifts with only a one-hour lunch and two 15-minute breaks. &quot;Due to the sheer volume of content, content moderators are permitted no more than 25 seconds per video, and simultaneously view three to ten videos at the same time,&quot; according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Plaintiff has trouble sleeping and when she does sleep, she has horrific nightmares.</p></blockquote><p>Along with other social media companies including Facebook and YouTube, TikTok developed guidelines to help moderators cope with child abuse and other traumatic images.

However, TikTok allegedly failed to implement those guidelines, according to the lawsuit.</p><p>Content moderators take the brunt of graphic and traumatic images that appear on social media, making sure that users don&#39;t have to experience them.

Amazon has agreed to remind current and former workers across the US about their labor rights on notices posted in workplaces, and on the mobile app and website for workers. Amazon will also send a copy of the notice to email addresses it has on file for any employee who worked at its facilities between March 22nd and December 22nd.</p><p>The notice informs workers that they have the legal right to join, form or assist with a union. They can select a representative to bargain with Amazon on their behalf and &quot;act together with other employees for your benefit and protection.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, workers have more leeway to organize in company facilities. In the notice, Amazon states it will not tell them to leave a property or threaten disciplinary action &quot;when you are exercising your right to engage in union or protected concerted activities by talking to your co-workers in exterior non-work areas during non-work time.&quot; Nor will it ask workers about union activity, or why they&#39;re speaking to co-workers, according to the notice.</p><p>It&#39;ll be easier for the NLRB to sue Amazon if the agency believes it violated the agreement. In such cases, the company agreed to let the NLRB forego an administrative hearing process, which can take a long time to complete.</p><p>“This settlement agreement provides a crucial commitment from Amazon to millions of its workers across the United States that it will not interfere with their right to act collectively to improve their workplace by forming a union or taking other collective action,” NLRB general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/23/business/amazon-labor-deal.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>. Engadget has contacted Amazon for comment.</p><p>The agreement is related to six cases brought forward by workers who complained Amazon was impeding their efforts to organize. The company previously settled NLRB cases on an individual basis, but this a broader agreement. The agreement includes references to employees, but not contractors, who make up the bulk of Amazon&#39;s delivery workforce. It&#39;s unclear whether they will be afforded the same rights and protections under the deal.</p><p>The NLRB and Amazon have been at odds in recent times. In November, the labor board ordered Amazon to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-election-rerun-073943796.html">rerun a union election</a> at an Alabama warehouse. It said Amazon interfered with the process.

Probably not, but one scientist is pressing forward anyway. <a href="https://ascii.jp/elem/000/004/078/4078646/"><em>ASCII</em></a> and <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/lick-it-up-japan-professor-creates-tele-taste-tv-screen-2021-12-23/"><em>Reuters</em></a> report Meiji University professor Homei Miyashita has presented <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5Gu1WgqTTw">Taste the TV</a>, a set you can lick to get the flavor of whatever&#39;s on-screen. The prototype sends electrical signals to 10 flavor canisters to create unique sprays that cover a (thankfully hygenic) film overlay.</p><p>The device has been long in development. Miyashita <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HIm4LoAZxU">discussed</a> the basic concept of a &quot;taste synthesizer&quot; in spring 2020, and offered an early look at the TV in October this year.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It sounds disgusting, and people would no doubt give you strange looks if you French-kissed your TV in the middle of a show. However, Miyashita doesn&#39;t necessarily see this as gimmick to add to everyday consumer screens, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-28-sky-3d-channel-closing.html">like 3D TV</a>. He instead imagined lickable screens as tools for cooks and sommeliers, and even hoped to build a platform where you could download tastes like you might songs or videos. This could help you taste recipes from around the world while staying at home.</p><p>The technology might be more practical than you think, too. The professor took about a year to build the prototype himself, and he estimated a shipping version would cost the equivalent of $875 to make. Although you probably wouldn&#39;t make one the centerpiece of your living room, it might be affordable enough for the culinary industry and dedicated gourmands.</p><div id="4c8caf76bd824008a5117a99b7bba672"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5Gu1WgqTTw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/taste-the-tv-lickable-screen-173805499.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2265169e-8204-4f40-b1b8-04428d9e66e4</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 17:38:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640281101</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T17:45:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/945a03e0-63f4-11ec-afeb-c4b0c40c6fdf" width="5406" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/945a03e0-63f4-11ec-afeb-c4b0c40c6fdf" width="5406" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kim Kyung Hoon / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Student of Meiji University Yuki Hou licks a screen of Taste the TV (TTTV), a prototype lickable TV screen that can imitate the flavours of various foods, during its demonstration at the university in Tokyo, Japan, December 22, 2021.

All four said they would not attend in person due to concerns related to the new COVID-19 omicron variant. And while they&#39;re all important names in tech, they&#39;re not a hardware player in the same way Lenovo is, nor have they historically had as large of a physical presence at the show as it has in years past.</p><p>For the time being, the Consumer Technology Association, the organization that puts together CES every year, still plans to move forward with the event. &quot;Given CES&#39; comprehensive health measures — vaccination requirement, masking and availability of COVID-19 tests — coupled with lower attendance and social distancing measures, we are confident that attendees and exhibitors can have a socially distanced but worthwhile and productive event in Las Vegas, as well as a rewarding experience on our digital access,&quot; the organization told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/23/lenovo-to-suspend-in-person-ces-activities-as-more-exhibitors-embrace-omicron-caution/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>.</p><p>There&#39;s still much that scientists don&#39;t know about omicron, but early data suggests it&#39;s a  highly transmissible strain of the coronavirus. Federal health officials said on Monday the variant accounted for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/omicron-majority-us-cases-833001ef99862bd6ac17935f65c896cf">73 percent</a> of all new cases nationwide the week ending December 18th. It made up 12.6 percent of all COVID-19 cases in the US just seven days earlier. In some areas of the country, including parts of New York states and the Pacific Northwest, the variant&#39;s share was even higher. Scientists have also found most non-mRNA vaccines, including Sinovac and Sinophram, offer little protection against the strain. It&#39;s understandable then why many companies want to play it safe, and it&#39;s fair to say Lenovo probably won&#39;t be the last to pull out of CES 2022.</p><p><strong>Update 12:31PM ET</strong>:  Alphabet&#39;s autonomous car unit Waymo <a href="https://blog.waymo.com/2021/12/meet-waymo-at-ces-2022.html">announced</a> today it too won&#39;t have a physical presence at CES 2022.

It&#39;s easy to feel stressed and overwhelmed,&quot; the leaked email, dated November 23, reads. &quot;And while most of us never pose a risk to others, some people can act out in a way that causes concern. This could be due to many factors in their lives, not just what they experience at work. <strong>Regardless of the cause, workplace violence is never the answer.</strong>&quot; [Emphasis theirs]</p><p>The worker who provided the email to Engadget could not recall similar messaging during previous peaks. &quot;I&#39;ve been with Amazon a little over four years now and they&#39;ve never mentioned anything about our mental status until now,&quot; they wrote in an email. &quot;Our leadership hasn&#39;t announced anything [other] than quota related issues.&quot;</p><p>The email goes on to draw a connection between the grueling workload of peak and the potential for self-harm. &quot;<strong>Remember that your mental health matters</strong>,&quot; it reads. &quot;If you experience stress, feelings of depression, anxiety, or thoughts of suicide, please talk with your manager, a human resources business partner, or a mental health professional.&quot; It directs workers to use the company&#39;s &quot;free, confidential counselors and other resources.&quot;</p><p>Two of the associates who spoke to Engadget recalled being shown a video, covering similar subject matter, during their training.</p><p>&quot;It was stupid things like call the employee resource center, and talking about &#39;if you feel like you want to harm somebody you can tell your supervisor and you&#39;ll be allowed to leave work and go home.&#39; It was just such bullshit,&quot; one recalled. The same associate stated that the employee resource center is &quot;like a black hole of &#39;press one for this&#39;, I don&#39;t even know how to talk to a real person there.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They have a number you call if you start feeling suicidal or depressed from working too much,&quot; another told Engadget. &quot;They put a video on during training where they talked about how a lot of workers feel this way.

Jace Crouch, a former employee quoted in the story, said that &quot;people having breakdowns [are] a regular occurrence&quot; within these facilities.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson declined to answer specific questions sent by Engadget, including whether the company had seen any uptick in workplace violence.

This includes providing resources throughout the year for anyone who may be dealing with stress in their personal lives or at work, and making sure they feel seen and able to ask for help if they need it.”</p><p><em>Are you a tech worker with concerns about your job, safety, or the work you&#39;re required to do?

As the <em>Associated Press</em><a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-science-business-health-medication-f3578e19f2840ce167f081ec9e236c3c">reports</a>, the Food and Drug Administration has given emergency use <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-additional-oral-antiviral-treatment-covid-19-certain">authorization</a> for Merck&#39;s Molnupiravir pill. The treatment limits replication of SARS-CoV-2 by inserting &quot;errors&quot; in the virus&#39; genetic code while an infection is relatively young, ideally preventing mild or moderate cases from becoming severe in high-risk patients.</p><p>The medicine might not get as much use as Pfizer&#39;s Paxlovid, however. Merck&#39;s offering will only be available to those 18 years or older versus 12 years for Pfizer&#39;s, as there are concerns it might affect bone and cartilage development in younger patients. There are also warnings against using it during pregnancy or while attempting to conceive — the FDA said people should use birth control both during and after treatment, with women waiting days and men waiting three months.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Molnupiravir also doesn&#39;t appear to be as effective as Paxlovid. While Pfizer&#39;s solution reduced hospitalization and death by as much as 90 percent, Merck&#39;s only managed 30 percent. This pill may become the secondary option, particularly in situations where Paxlovid isn&#39;t available. Both companies&#39; products are expected to remain effective against the virus&#39; Omicron variant as they don&#39;t target mutating spike proteins.</p><p>Still, this might become another useful tool for minimizing COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths. Pfizer&#39;s pill will be the most readily available when the US is ordering enough to treat 10 million patients, but there will be enough of Merck&#39;s drug to address 3.1 million. Even if the effectiveness is limited, that could spare hundreds of thousands of people from the worst the disease has to offer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fda-merck-covid-19-antivirual-pill-molnupiravir-162951648.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e14985e3-732a-4bdd-bda9-ff681d0e96cb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 16:29:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640276993</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T16:30:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Pharmaceuticals & Drug Trials]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/758059d0-6406-11ec-bffd-49a7a1a32902" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/758059d0-6406-11ec-bffd-49a7a1a32902" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Merck]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Merck molnupiravir COVID-19 antiviral pill]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Merck molnupiravir COVID-19 antiviral pill]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[How the pandemic supercharged the creator economy in 2021]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The multibillion dollar industry of game streamers, beauty vloggers, podcast producers, fitness influencers, newsletter writers and other social media stars who make up the “creator economy,” began long before 2021. Yet 2021 saw more platforms throw more money and resources at independent content <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/creators/">creators</a> than ever before.</p><p>This year, companies that had previously shown little interest in courting “influencers” or building relationships with creators began to invest in building monetization tools for them. And even more established, creator-friendly companies significantly ramped up their investments with new funds and tools.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Twitter, which had previously only ever had a single monetization feature — a video centric tool used by publishers — opted to reorient <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-15th-anniversary-140008110.html">its entire platform</a> around creators. It built Super Follows, a Patreon-esque subscription service for influencers. It launched Ticketed Spaces, so people could make money from its burgeoning live audio feature. It launched in-app tripping, and started building a newsletter platform.</p><p>Snapchat, which at one time actively shunned the idea of influencers, just announced that it had funneled more than <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/spotlight-1-year-anniversary">$250 million</a> to creators via its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-launches-spotlight-tiktok-140020938.html">Spotlight</a> feature, which launched at the end of 2020. Some of the app’s biggest stars are even getting their own <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/snapchat-creator-payout-250-million-1235132541/">shows</a> in Snapchat Discover.</p><p>Facebook also took a renewed interest in the influencers and content creators who had long asked for more opportunities from the platform. Mark Zuckerberg has repeatedly labeled creators as one of the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q2-2021-earnings-214311750.html">top priorities</a> and announced a plan to invest $1 billion into tools for them by the end of 2022. Since then, Facebook and Instagram have launched a dizzying number of creator-focused updates and monetization features.</p><p>Platforms not traditionally associated with influencers also began throwing money at creators and monetization features. Pinterest launched a $500,000 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-creator-fund-creator-code-150013929.html">creator fund</a> and built its first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-shopping-idea-pins-affiliate-links-155149992.html">monetization tools.</a> LinkedIn — yes, that LinkedIn — announced a<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/linkedin-is-launching-its-own-25m-fund-and-incubator-for-creators/"> $25 million</a> fund. Clubhouse added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/clubhouse-payments-060935128.html">tipping</a>. Tumblr, meanwhile, launched a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tumblr-post-plus-expansion-140056311.html">subscription service</a> for its bloggers.</p><p>Even YouTube, the most established platform for creators to make money, identified “growing the creator economy” as its top <a href="https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/letter-from-susan-our-2021-priorities/">2021 priority</a>. It launched an all-new $100 million fund <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-shorts-100-million-dollar-creator-fund-launch-160058966.html">just for Shorts</a>, its TikTok-like feature. TikTok itself, which started a $200 million fund <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-creator-fund-183231670.html">in 2020</a>, also launched <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tiktok-adds-creator-monetization-features-143319737.html">new monetization</a> features.</p><p>With all that money flowing in, it’s no surprise that the number of individual creators also boomed. One report from payments company Stripe, which powers payments for dozens of influencer platforms, found that the number of creators was <a href="https://stripe.com/blog/creator-economy">up 48 percent</a> in 2021, compared with 2020. And that’s just a “fraction” of the total ecosystem, according to the company.</p><p>“If the recent exponential growth of the creator economy keeps up, these 50 platforms could be supporting more than 15.5 million creators in five years,” the company wrote.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/4fe4c1c0-628f-11ec-b6a9-3a5efd49a59b" alt="The number of creators has skyrocketed, according to Stripe." data-uuid="4e68bb58-a846-316f-a212-8ef76f077655"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Stripe</div></figure><p>Growth wasn’t limited just to the major platforms, either. Startups catering to content makers and their needs also surged, with more than $3.7 billion in funding going toward “startups focused on creators,” according to <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-creator-economy-investments-could-hit-5-billion-this-year?rc=whf0fd">a report</a> in <em>The Information.</em></p><p>One of the main drivers of this surge in activity was the pandemic. While creators were making money long before the pandemic, the industry was almost perfectly primed to absorb many of the changes brought on by it.</p><p>“I think the pandemic definitely turbocharged the creator economy through both necessity and through choice,” Li Jin, founder of Atelier Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in the creator economy, said in an interview earlier this year.</p><p>“Necessity meaning a lot of people were left without offline alternatives for work and income and had to turn to online platforms in order to continue their creative careers. And choice in the sense that obviously we had a lot of free time during the pandemic where we were just kind of stuck at home. I think a lot of people took that time and they started creating content.”</p><p>At the same time, the pandemic also seems to have shifted the way that many people think about work itself. While this year was full of hand-wringing about <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/how-do-you-make-7-million-workers-disappear/620475/">labor shortages</a> and whether or not people want <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/03/business/jobs-workers-economy.html">to go back</a> to work, it’s not difficult to understand why some, particularly younger people, might opt for a different path. Zuckerberg described the shift as “​​people being able to make a living by expressing their creativity and by doing things they want to do, rather than things they have to.” Creators, he has said, deserve to be “rewarded” for their work,</p><p>But as Jin and others have pointed out, major platforms aren’t suddenly embracing creators just because they care about helping them create sustainable independent businesses. The economics are ultimately weighted in their favor as well.</p><p>Creators are responsible for a significant amount of engagement on their platforms of choice. If enough of an app’s biggest stars leave, they could take large chunks of users with them. Revenue from creators could also one day help Facebook generate income beyond advertising. Zuckerberg has pledged not to take a cut of their earnings <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-creators-earnings-cut-2023-paid-events-newsletters-164341439.html">until 2023</a>, but even a relatively small commission could eventually add up to a significant amount. Likewise, Twitter has said it plans to take a 20 percent cut of Super Follow subscriptions from its highest-earning creators, though it could still be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/16/twitter-super-follows-has-generated-only-around-6k-in-its-first-two-weeks/">some time</a> before the feature makes serious cash for anyone.</p><p>Creators are also crucial to drawing in new users and keeping platforms’ existing ones entertained. For Facebook, they could help the company avoid, or at least dampen, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks">“existential threat”</a> of declining teen users. Snapchat has touted Spotlight as a key source <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-q4-2020-earnings-220645065.html">of growth</a>. Even LinkedIn has <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/meet-first-class-linkedins-creator-accelerator-program-andrei-santalo/">said</a> creators can help their users get  “better at what they do.”</p><p>Ultimately, though, it’s the platforms that will benefit most from creators, according to Jin. “Nothing is done purely altruistically,” she said. “It&#39;s to strengthen the company and their profitability.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/how-the-pandemic-supercharged-the-creator-economy-153050958.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">db1bb273-90dc-46a4-9ba9-8d5c8bbec995</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 15:30:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640177464</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T12:51:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/004b1a10-628f-11ec-bf9f-ce9fedd2a294" width="3671" height="2206" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/004b1a10-628f-11ec-bf9f-ce9fedd2a294" width="3671" height="2206" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Alessandro Biascioli via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Happy Asian woman wearing face mask and vlogging online using smartphone cam and influencer led while drinking a coffee sitting in bar during corona virus outbreak]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Happy Asian woman wearing face mask and vlogging online using smartphone cam and influencer led while drinking a coffee sitting in bar during corona virus outbreak]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's Elite 85t earbuds drop to an all-time low of $140 for today only]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t worry if you&#39;re scrambling for a last-minute audio gift or IOU — you have good timing.

Sadly, politics and commerce put a hard thumb on proceedings, limiting the action possible. Commitments to “phase down” coal, rather than a firm pledge to eliminate it outright, show how far we still have to go. But the event also served to highlight the extent of what needs to be done if humanity’s going to survive beyond the next century.</p><p>One “victory” out of the event was the belief that ensuring global warming held at 1.5 degrees was still possible. It’s worth saying, however, that <a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/unep-1-5c-climate-target-slipping-out-of-reach">1.5 degrees</a> isn’t a target to meet so much as an acceptance of impending disaster. In October, <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf">the IPCC</a> explained that such a temperature increase will cause significant upticks in the frequency of extreme heat waves, monsoon-like rainfall and widespread droughts. Extreme weather events that may have taken place once every 50 years a few centuries ago could become a regular, and fatal, occurrence.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>All the while, the facts of the matter are unchanged: Humanity needs to avoid adding new carbon emissions while also tackling those we’ve already emitted. That means an aggressive reduction of every man-made carbon-emitting process everywhere on Earth, the total reformation of agriculture and an unprecedented rollout of carbon capture and storage technology. And, ideally, that process should have begun the better part of two decades ago.</p><p>There are many dispiriting facts about the world, but one that always hurts is the fact that coal plants are <em>still</em> being greenlit. <a href="https://globalenergymonitor.org/projects/global-coal-plant-tracker/">Global Energy Monitor’s data</a> has plants currently being permitted or under construction in (deep breath) China, India, Indonesia, Turkey, Mongolia, Vietnam, Singapore, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Greece, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Poland, Kazakhstan, Colombia, Brazil and Mexico. As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/cop/coal-trajectory-is-set-whether-its-phase-out-or-phase-down-russell-2021-11-14/"><em>Reuters</em></a> says, each plant will be expected to run for at least 40 years, severely damaging efforts to go Carbon Negative. Not only is it in everyone’s best interest that these plants don’t go online, but wealthier nations have a moral obligation to help provide the funding to help at least some of those names move toward clean energy.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/87225780-6260-11ec-9b7b-e2dcc112d5c8" data-uuid="6fda6dd0-44d5-32f7-bc7c-0eae95148da0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Tunvarat Pruksachat via Getty Images</div></figure><p>The problem is that electricity is going to be the most important resource of the 21st century, especially if we’re going to tackle climate change. Many key technologies, like transportation, will ditch fossil fuels in favor of electricity as their primary source of fuel. The world’s demand for energy is going to increase, and we’re going to need to generate that power cleanly. The US Center for Climate and Energy Solutions believes that, by 2050, the world’s power needs will jump by 24 percent. So where will we get all of this clean power from?</p><p>Fusion has, forever, been held up as a magic bullet that will totally eradicate our worries about energy generation. Unlike Nuclear Fission, it produces little waste, requires little raw fuel and can’t produce a runaway reaction. Unfortunately, Fusion remains as elusive as The Venus de Milo’s arms or a good new <em>Duke Nukem</em> game. ITER, the internationally-funded, French-built experimental reactor won’t be finished until 2025 at the earliest and is still just a testbed. If successful — and that’s a big if — we’re still a decade away from any serious progress being made, at which point mass decarbonization will already need to be well underway.</p><p>That means any power decarbonization will have to come from the renewable technology that’s available to us today. Nuclear, Wind, Solar, Geothermal and Tidal power all need to be ramped up to fill in the gap, but the scale of the task in the US alone is staggering. According to the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&amp;t=3">EIA</a>, the US generated just short of 2,500 billion kWh using fossil fuels in 2020. If you wanted to, for instance, replace all of that with nuclear power, you’d need to build anything in the region of 300 reactors, or increase the number of solar panels installed in the US by roughly a hundred percent — and that’s before we talk about intermittency.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/746d99e0-51f5-11ec-bffe-0874e42b9891" alt="Urtopia ebike." data-uuid="c7b726a6-2124-31c0-9dbe-f1d26fb84425"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>One thing we can do, however, is to reduce our demand for energy to lessen the need for such a dramatic shift. That can be, for instance, as easy as better insulating your home (in cold climates) or improving the efficiency of AC systems (in warm climates). Another smart move is to ditch the car in favor of public transportation, walking, or getting on your bike. There is evidence that e-bike adoption is becoming a big deal, with <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/carltonreid/2020/12/02/e-bike-sales-to-grow-from-37-million-to-17-million-per-year-by-2030-forecast-industry-experts/?sh=154cbaeb2876"><em>Forbes</em></a> saying that sales are tipped to grow from just under 4 million annually in 2020 to close to 17 million by 2030.</p><p>None of this, however, will matter much unless we can also find a way to pay off the debts humanity has racked up over the last century. The <a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/sites/2/2019/05/SR15_SPM_version_report_LR.pdf">IPCC</a> believes that we need to extract up to one trillion tonnes of atmospheric CO2 in the near future. This can be done with massive tree planting works, more of which needs to be done, but also this process may need a little help.</p><p>That’s why a number of startups have been working on industrial processes to extract CO2 from the atmosphere. Right now, such a process is very expensive, but it’s hoped that as the technology improves, the cost will start to tumble. There’s also a concern, of course, that running schemes like this will give polluting companies and nations a free license to avoid reform.</p><p>As much as we can hope that this technology matures quickly, the rate of progress needs to get a lot faster a, uh, <em>lot </em>faster. For instance, Climeworks’ Orca, its new flagship carbon capture plant in Iceland, will extract 4,000 tons of CO2 per year. If we’re going to reach the point where we can avert a climate catastrophe using extraction alone, we’ll need this capacity to increase by about a hundred million times.</p><p>The point of this is, broadly speaking, to outline how much more sharply our attitudes toward the climate need to shift. If we’re going to succeed at defeating climate change then we’re going to need to go onto the sort of war footing – where resources are devoted to nothing but solving the crisis – that few can ever imagine undertaking. But, as most of the resources point out, the only way that we’re going to stave off the damage after dragging our feet for so long is to go all-out in search of a solution.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cop26-climate-change-resolution-carbon-emissions-143037481.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e47c537-9af4-4f8f-9770-25e71a806b0f</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 14:30:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640271278</ingested><modified>2021-12-23T14:54:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Climate Change]]></category><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/45194840-619c-11ec-bf3f-d25ff81ecf83" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/45194840-619c-11ec-bf3f-d25ff81ecf83" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[INA FASSBENDER via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TOPSHOT - Open-cast lignite mining is seen near the coal-fired power station Neurath of German energy giant RWE in Garzweiler, western Germany, on October 27, 2021. - From October 31 to November 12, the 26th World Climate Conference (COP26) will take place in Glasgow, Scotland.

Somewhere around season three or four the show finds its way and actually becomes good, if not great. This isn’t a phenomenon limited to Trek, of course, but only Trek has a specific name for it: <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GrowingTheBeard">growing the beard</a>. This is in reference to commanders William Riker and Benjamin Sisko, who both started their respective shows clean-shaven but grew beards around the time <em>The Next Generation</em> and <em>Deep Space Nine</em> got noticeably better. And <em>Discovery</em> might finally be ready to do its own metamorphosis, but instead of a beard it’s a change of format that has fans talking.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the complaints about <em>Discovery</em>’s first three seasons — besides the grimdark tone, the infallibility of Michael Burnham and all the <em>crying</em> — was that it largely embraced a more serial format, where each episode was another installment in one long ongoing storyline. Sure, there were occasional one-off adventures, but each episode was still firmly focused on the larger story.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/5705a470-636f-11ec-86f7-4c6c0c2b61ff" style="height:800;width:1200;" alt="Pictured: Anthony Rapp as Stamets of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

However, unlike previous seasons where each episode would have been focused on one step toward finding a solution, the problem-solving has taken a back seat to a largely standalone A-plot.</p><p>The shift could be first seen in episode three, where Burnham and her crew are tasked with tracking down a rogue member of the Qowat Milat (as I described them to my editor: ninja nuns). The DMA is more of a C-plot in this episode, with the B-plot position occupied by the story of Gray Tal and his new android body. Episode four was Tilly trying to train and keep a group of Starfleet cadets alive (in a plot reminiscent of Voyager episodes ‘<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Learning_Curve_(episode)">Learning Curve</a>’ and ‘<a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Good_Shepherd_(episode)">Good Shepherd</a>’). Episode five saw the crew tasked with evacuating a planet threatened by the DMA. The anomaly may have been the instigating force in the episode, but it was in fact interchangeable with pretty much any other planetary threat since the episode was focused more on Michael’s struggle to free six prisoners on the surface.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7433e340-636f-11ec-bbfd-b66398fd2481" style="height:800;width:1200;" alt="Pictured: David Ajala as Book of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

All Rights Reserved." data-uuid="4b3d4679-4eb8-3b25-97e5-f385c270c02f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>This week’s episode finds <em>Discovery</em> traveling into a subspace rift created by the DMA and becoming stranded, with the ship’s newly sentient AI Zora unable to lead the crew to safety. However, while the anomaly is once again the cause of Discovery’s problems it’s also, once again, an interchangeable threat. The real drive of the episode is the problem-solving to get the crew out, and the personal struggles of characters like Zora and Cleveland Booker.</p><p>Next week will bring the Dark Matter Anomaly back to the forefront, but that’s only logical since the seventh episode marks the rough midpoint of the 13-episode season as well as the end of our calendar year. It’s not unusual for many television shows to use this time to “check in” on their major storylines and advance those plots to the next phase. But it is unusual for <em>Discovery </em>in that it doesn’t represent as clean a divide as in previous seasons: season one went from the Klingon War to the Mirror Universe, season two went from the mystery of the Red Angel to battling the evil AI Control. Next week’s episode represents a smoother transition than previously.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/91ef9500-636f-11ec-b2e5-8a1184d4a634" style="height:800;width:1200;" alt="Pictured: Ian Alexander as Gray of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

" data-uuid="a0a92894-d768-3d4b-8a51-db4d7eba9f5d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>That smoothness is mostly due to the fact that the ongoing storyline hasn’t been given as much time to openly flourish, instead bubbling in the background while the show instead focuses on character-building single-shot adventures. Standalone episodes might feel outdated in an era of streaming and binging, where viewers can get their answers right away so there’s no need to make each individual chapter feel “complete.” There’s no chance to become unsatisfied by the content of an episode when the next one is merely seconds away. Even shows that premiere week by week have fallen into the trap, assuming that most viewers will binge the show later on anyway, with only the diehards watching each installment as it drops.</p><p>But for most of its existence at this point, Star Trek has been a franchise for the die-hards. The people who can’t wait for the next episode, the people who will read and write recaps on their favorite pop culture sites and those who share theories on social media. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Paramount+" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/3PY0yk">Paramount+</a> has put a lot of its chips on the strength of this die-hard base, stacking its production schedule with five different Star Trek shows that rarely overlap, meaning a fan who wants to see everything as soon as possible will need to maintain their Paramount+ subscription all-year-round.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/b9ff03a0-636f-11ec-bf76-034ceaae9d10" style="height:800;width:1200;" alt="Pictured: Grudge the cat of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

All Rights Reserved." data-uuid="4e7e082e-e4c5-34ce-b73b-d82d098a52d7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>While fan complaints may have played a big role in <em>Discovery</em>’s decision to switch to a more episodic format, it’s likely that the desire to keep fans on the hook for the show’s entire run played an even bigger part. When <em>Discovery</em> was the only Star Trek show, and one of the few Paramount+ offerings period, it was common for viewers to only sign up for a subscription when they wanted to binge something — sometimes even within the free week the service offers to new customers. Shows like <em>Lower Decks</em>, <em>Prodigy</em> and the upcoming <em>Strange New Worlds </em>already operate with a more episodic format, meaning <em>Discovery</em> could have created a “hole” in an ongoing subscription for viewers, a chance for them to take a break from Star Trek and from paying $6 a month.</p><p>With an episodic show it’s a lot harder to ignore it while it’s running; each episode represents a complete viewing experience, making the wait between episodes less excruciating. And when <em>Discovery</em> encounters new worlds and new adventures every week, it gives the fans something new to talk about, instead of rehashing the same old theories about the ongoing storyline again and again until the season ends. Star Trek was just made for episodic viewing, and embracing the format will make it easier for <em>Discovery</em> to hold fan interest over time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-season-four-episode-six-140053318.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">174045ac-7acb-4ad3-a026-06245c648a6a</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 14:00:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1640209837</ingested><modified>2021-12-22T21:50:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Television]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7cbf4390-636c-11ec-bffb-130f907d29c9" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-12/7cbf4390-636c-11ec-bffb-130f907d29c9" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pictured: Sonequa Martin Green as Burnham and Doug Jones as Saru of the Paramount+ original series STAR TREK: DISCOVERY.

The workers originally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-staten-island-warehouse-unionization-drive-193814629.html">filed</a> a petition with the National Labor Relations Board back in November, but they had to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/12/amazon-union-withdraws-staten-island/">withdraw</a> it after failing to gather enough signatures to be approved. This time, the organizers were reportedly <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/business/amazon-union-staten-island.html">able to gather</a> over 2,500 worker signatures or half of the 5,000 people employed at the facility.</p><p>The workers are hoping to form the Amazon Labor Union, which will be an independent group that&#39;s not connected to any major national union. One of their lead organizers is Christian Smalls who led a walkout at JFK8 over the e-commerce giant&#39;s handling of COVID safety at the warehouse. Amazon fired Smalls after that, telling <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/30/amazon-fires-staten-island-coronavirus-strike-leader-chris-smalls.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> that he &quot;received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines.&quot; Even so, Smalls is still very much involved in the facility&#39;s renewed efforts to unionize. In an email to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/12/22/amazon-warehouse-union"><em>The Washington Post</em></a>, he referenced what happened at Amazon&#39;s Bessemer warehouse, saying that &quot;long drawn-out voting processes are controlled by the bosses who use that period to lie to, intimidate and threaten the workers into voting no for the union.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Majority of the workers at the company&#39;s Bessemer, Alabama facility voted against unionization back in April. However, the election was fraught with controversy, with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) — the union the workers were supposed to join — accusing Amazon of interfering with the elections. One of the main issues they pointed out was that the company installed the ballot box in front of the warehouse and in view of security cameras, making workers feel as if their votes were being monitored. After looking into the RWDSU&#39;s complaint, the NLRB <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-election-rerun-073943796.html">ordered</a> Amazon to hold another vote.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon has been adamantly opposed to its workers joining unions. When the people at JFK8 first filed a petition to unionize, the e-commerce giant told <em>Engadget</em> in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;As a company, we don’t think unions are the best answer for our employees. Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes — quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle. The benefits of direct relationships between managers and employees can’t be overstated — these relationships allow every employee’s voice to be heard, not just the voices of a select few. We’ve made great progress in recent years and months in important areas like pay and safety.
