The automaker certainly has roles in mind for the Re:Move, however. It pictures the sled filling in for lighter delivery duties, such as online orders. The machine might also help in rural areas where there isn&#39;t much infrastructure for conventional vehicles. Don&#39;t be surprised if you see this or vehicles like it in villages where more &#39;conventional&#39; EVs just wouldn&#39;t be an option.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/polestar-re-move-working-prototype-electric-cargo-sled-090000981.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">05331d4d-9f5c-46ae-a68f-9dc75ac84bc6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 09:00:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630871967</ingested><modified>2021-09-05T19:59:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Industrials]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2e448280-0e7f-11ec-bffd-a4462c395ffd" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2e448280-0e7f-11ec-bffd-a4462c395ffd" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Polestar]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Polestar Re:Move electric cargo sled prototype]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Polestar Re:Move electric cargo sled prototype]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hyundai's 'Hydrogen Vision 2040' includes trailer drones and a fuel cell supercar]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Despite its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-12-23-hydrogen-fuel-cell-explainer.html">problems</a> including inefficiency and pollution, Hyundai is betting big on hydrogen.

Powered by the modular fuel cell &quot;e-Bogie&quot; wheel sub-frame, it could travel up to 1,000 km on a tank of H2, &quot;comparable to existing container transportation system.&quot; The trailer itself would contain the sensors and computers needed for autonomous driving.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/888a0af0-0fb8-11ec-b7cf-e0638cf3d6f7" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Hyundai&#39;s &#39;Hydrogen Vision 2040&#39; includes trailer drones and a fuel cell supercar" data-uuid="5f601d9d-7dad-32af-95f3-263c3cf1aa74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hyundai                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </div></figure><p>The e-Bogies could operate independently or be used in pairs to make up a Trailer Drone.

The trailers could even be divided into three containers, making the majority of the trip connected then breaking away into independent e-Bogies to the final destination.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/da514100-0fb8-11ec-be6f-4958f2388614" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Hyundai&#39;s &#39;Hydrogen Vision 2040&#39; includes trailer drones and a fuel cell supercar" data-uuid="b36a5bc0-313e-3999-bc5c-f9d32c0ed91d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hyundai</div></figure><p>The automaker is also interested in consumer tech, unveiling a 670 horsepower hydrogen plug-in hybrid sports car called the Vision FK concept developed in collaboration with Rimac. It&#39;s powered by Hyundai&#39;s next-gen fuel cell tech, mated to a large battery pack. As such, it could be plugged in for extra range or powered by hydrogen. Since a fuel cell could directly charge the battery (or powered the four independent motors), the operation would be a bit simpler than a gas-powered hybrid car.&nbsp;</p><p>Hyundai said it would be able to go about 600 km (372 miles) on a charge, and be refueled again in just five minutes — not counting the battery recharge time. As it stands now, it&#39;s just a concept and Hyundai has no concrete plans to put it in production.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/f5694a00-0fb8-11ec-bade-5d33313953b1" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Hyundai&#39;s &#39;Hydrogen Vision 2040&#39; includes trailer drones and a fuel cell supercar" data-uuid="ffdb9fbc-d4bb-39eb-bab1-a0bb59541b90"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hyundai</div></figure><p>Hyundai also unveiled its third-generation fuel cell stack technology, expected to arrive in 2023 and replace Hyundai&#39;s current Nexo fuel cell tech. They&#39;ll be available in a 100 kW unit that&#39;s 30 percent smaller than Hyundai&#39;s current 95 kW stack, and a 200 kW version similar in size to the current Nexo model but with more than double the output.&nbsp;</p><p>The new fuel cells have a target life of 500,000 km (310,000 miles), up from 160,000 km for the current generation. Hyundai also expects the next-gen tech to cost around half of current fuel cells. They&#39;re also highly modular, meaning you can stack them to create &quot;Power Unit Modules&quot; with up to a megawatt of output &quot;ideal for emergency power systems for large ships or IT companies,&quot; Hyundai said. Another &quot;full-flat&quot; system keeps the stack height under 10 inches for installation in the floor or ceiling of buses, trains or trams.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/21cd93d0-0fb9-11ec-9f37-e29f3f316e06" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="Hyundai&#39;s &#39;Hydrogen Vision 2040&#39; includes trailer drones and a fuel cell supercar" data-uuid="2a407ce7-58df-30eb-b390-bf66ad6fb1d3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Hyundai</div></figure><p>&nbsp;One of the main problems with hydrogen power is the lack of infrastructure and Hyundai is addressing that with the H Moving Station concept. It&#39;s a heavy-duty vehicle designed to offer hydrogen refueling services in areas with limited infrastructure like rural areas or construction sites. It also unveiled the Rescue Hydrogen Generator Vehicle (RHGV). Rather than doling out hydrogen, it uses hydrogen fuel cells to generate electricity for stranded EVs or to power homes in the event of an emergency outage.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this looks promising, but there&#39;s a reason most manufacturers are moving toward battery-powered EVs and away from hydrogen. Hydrogen is a highly explosive fuel that needs to be stored at very high pressures (either 350 or 700 bar), making infrastructure expensive and complex. On top of that, most hydrogen used in the US is created by reforming methane using steam, a process that produces <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2020/06/06/estimating-the-carbon-footprint-of-hydrogen-production/?sh=3a9679fc24bd">significant amounts</a> of CO2 that contributes to global warming. It also doesn&#39;t reflect well on the technology that some its greatest support <a href="https://unearthed.greenpeace.org/2020/12/08/unearthed-today-why-oil-companies-want-you-to-love-hydrogen/">comes from the oil industry</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hyundais-hydrogen-vision-2040-includes-trailer-drones-and-a-670-hp-hybrid-sports-car-085744900.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7914f911-771d-45c9-be73-a65adaa70ac3</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 08:57:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631006037</ingested><modified>2021-09-07T09:14:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/888a0af0-0fb8-11ec-b7cf-e0638cf3d6f7" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b5ff0170-0fb8-11ec-b45b-80ee628d58f1" width="1200" height="630" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Hyundai]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Hyundai's 'Hydrogen Vision 2040' includes trailer drones and a fuel cell supercar]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Hyundai's 'Hydrogen Vision 2040' includes trailer drones and a fuel cell supercar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Singapore has deployed robots to patrol public areas]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Singapore is known for having stringent laws and for having surveillance cameras all over the city-state.

Since it&#39;s based in Switzerland, ProtonMail has to obey the country&#39;s laws. That includes logging IP addresses from users in &quot;extreme criminal cases,&quot; according to <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/transparency-report/">its own transparency report</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Andy Yen, Proton&#39;s CEO, <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/climate-activist-arrest/">pointed out in a blog post today </a>that the company has tried to make it clear that it has to follow local laws. &quot;In this case, Proton received a legally binding order from Swiss authorities which we are obligated to comply with,&quot; he wrote. &quot;There was no possibility to appeal this particular request.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The case in question involves activists who took over commercial locations and apartments near Paris&#39;s Place Sainte Marthe.

Should it become law, the legislation could require <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/amazon"><ins>Amazon</ins></a> and other warehouse companies to make significant changes. Bill AB-701, which passed the State Assembly in May, would force warehouse operators like Amazon to be transparent about the quotas their workers are expected to meet.</p><p>&quot;The bill would provide that an employee shall not be required to meet a quota that prevents compliance with meal or rest periods, use of bathroom facilities or occupational health and safety laws,&quot; the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=202120220AB701"><ins>legislative counsel&#39;s digest</ins></a> for the proposed legislation reads. The bill also seeks to ban employers from punishing employees who don&#39;t meet quotas that don&#39;t allow them to take breaks or comply with health and safety rules. If workers can&#39;t realistically hit Amazon&#39;s productivity expectations, the company may have to lower quotas in the state.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Several Amazon workers have spoken of foregoing or minimizing bathroom breaks to ensure they meet quotas. According to reports, the company&#39;s expectations lead many delivery drivers to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"><ins>pee in bottles</ins></a> and coffee cups instead of taking time to use a restroom. Warehouse workers have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-02-amazon-minimum-wage-15-dollars.html">shared similar complaints</a>. Amazon closely monitors worker productivity, including how long each employee spends <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-warehouse-policies-020626313.html"><ins>away from their stations</ins></a>.</p><p>An Amazon spokesperson told <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/06/business/economy/amazon-california-warehouse-labor.html?referringSource=articleShare"><em>The New York Times</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that &quot;terminations for performance issues are rare,&quot; but they didn&#39;t comment directly on the bill.</p><p>Last year, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-automated-injuries-211813202.html"><ins>it emerged</ins></a> that Amazon reportedly expects workers to scan 400 items an hour at fulfillment centers that use robots. According to a report from the Center for Investigative Reporting, the rate of serious injuries sustained at those warehouses was 50 percent higher than in Amazon warehouses that aren&#39;t automated.&nbsp;</p><p>Warehouse injury researcher Edward Flores, faculty director of the Community and Labor Center at the University of California, Merced, told the <em>NYT </em>that repetitive strain injuries are a problem in automated warehouses. Workers are &quot;responding to the speed at which a machine is moving,&quot; which leads to &quot;higher incidence of repetitive motions and thus repetitive injuries,&quot; Dr. Flores said.</p><p>Amazon announced some measures aimed at reducing warehouse injuries in May. The plans included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-zenbooth-warehouse-worker-meditation-090643506.html"><ins>meditation kiosks</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-workers-wellness-204613763.html"><ins>zones</ins></a> where workers can stretch, as well as hourly “mind and body” prompts.</p><p>The company has a long history of controversial labor practices. At the start of this year, Amazon shut down a warehouse in Chicago where workers held walkouts and protested for improved working conditions. Some of those employees said they <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-megacycle-220236417.html"><ins>were given a choice</ins></a> between working 10-hour graveyard shifts at other fulfillment centers or finding a new job. At the time, Amazon denied that was the case.</p><p>In August, a National Labor Relations Board official recommended that workers at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama hold another union vote. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union accused Amazon of violating labor laws by interfering with the process. Workers at the fulfillment center <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-alabama-union-vote-154741754.html"><ins>voted against unionizing</ins></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-california-warehouse-worker-quotas-bill-191234363.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ec7c7211-9b76-4d13-b6f8-31c0b281987c</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 19:12:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630955557</ingested><modified>2021-09-06T19:12:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Labor Issues]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/27036300-b40d-11eb-b87f-03e76c502e1b" width="4600" height="2733" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/27036300-b40d-11eb-b87f-03e76c502e1b" width="4600" height="2733" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[RONNY HARTMANN via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An employee prepares a package for shipment at the Amazon logistics centre in Suelzetal near Magdeburg, eastern Germany, on Mai 12, 2021. - The US online sales giant had opened the new warehouse in Saxony-Anhalt in August 2020.

While the specs seem decent enough, it&#39;s the safety functions that are the most eye-catching aspect of this electric vehicle.</p><p>The Fireman Access feature stems from a partnership between Renault Group and French firefighters that stretches back for over a decade. The EV includes special access to the battery for rescue teams. Renault claims this can allow first responders to put out a battery fire in five minutes, compared with between one and three hours for most EV battery blazes. There&#39;s also a switch under the rear bench that lets rescue teams disconnect the battery.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition, Renault put a QR code on the windscreen. The idea is that rescue teams can scan the code to see details about the car&#39;s structure. They can find out the locations of the battery and airbags, as well as information about where it&#39;s safe to cut into the vehicle. Renault says this information can help first responders save up to 15 minutes when attempting to free a crash victim, which could help save lives.</p><div id="c449bd457af94f1292448e4538da8d32"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IAA21?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IAA21</a> | Welcome to the future with our all new Megane E-TECH 100% <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/electric?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#electric</a>: <br>✔️&quot;Made in ElectriCity&quot; 🇫🇷<br>✔️Unique with an innovative design<br>✔️At the cutting edge of technology<br>✔️Sustainable <br>To know more: <a href="https://t.co/TCYUm0jIS8">https://t.co/TCYUm0jIS8</a><a href="https://t.co/s7oBp5lv4P">pic.twitter.com/s7oBp5lv4P</a></p>— Renault Group (@renaultgroup) <a href="https://twitter.com/renaultgroup/status/1434779997789691909?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>No two EVs are built the same, and first responders won&#39;t necessarily know the intricacies of each vehicle. So, providing information about the Megane E-Tech Electric&#39;s structure using a QR code is a smart move that it&#39;d be nice to see more automakers adopt. The same goes for easy access to the battery to help put out fires faster.</p><p>The latest iteration of the Megane line is built on Renault&#39;s CMF-EV platform. For the body, designers took inspiration from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-renault-morphoz-concept-ev-transformer.html"><ins>Morphoz concept</ins></a> the company showed off last year. There are two powertrain options, as <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/renault-megane-e-tech-electric-battery-fire-safety-iaa/#ftag=CAD590a51e"><em><ins>CNET&#39;s Roadshow</ins></em></a> notes: a base model with 130 horsepower and a more advanced alternative with 215 hp and 221 pound-feet of torque.</p><p>You can choose between two battery packs as well. The 40 kWh option has a range of 186 miles (300 km), and the 60 kWh pack should get you up to 292 miles (470 km) of driving on a single charge, according to Renault. The company based the estimates on the European WLTP testing procedure. Plug the Megane E-Tech Electric into a 130 wW fast charging station, and you can add up to 186 miles of driving range in 30 minutes of charging time.</p><p>Elsewhere, the OpenR infotainment system is based on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/android%20automotive">Android Automotive OS</a>, so you&#39;ll have access to Google apps and Google Assistant. While you&#39;re on a longer trip, the system can help you locate charging stations that minimize your journey time, Renault says. The Megane E-Tech Electric orders open in February 2022, and sales start the following March.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/renault-megane-e-tech-electric-battery-fire-access-safety-163050987.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">26f75594-bb94-4c02-860e-828be2152224</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 16:30:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630944964</ingested><modified>2021-09-06T16:16:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Conglomerates]]></category><category><![CDATA[Utility Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c7d47c70-0f29-11ec-bff7-3352757a99e6" width="1400" height="709" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c7d47c70-0f29-11ec-bff7-3352757a99e6" width="1400" height="709" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Renault]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Renault Megane E-Tech Electric]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Renault Megane E-Tech Electric]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA says the Mars Perseverance rover has collected its first sample]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After initially <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-perserverance-mars-rover-rock-sample-failure-153947031.html">failing</a> to capture a rock sample, NASA has <a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1434376252819841026">confirmed</a> that Perseverance succeeded in its second attempt.

It will then repeat the process and collect as many samples as possible, leaving them scattered about the surface. NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) will send a Martian lander and sample collection rover to the same location near Jezero Crater to gather up those tubes and place them into a rocket bound for Earth.&nbsp;</p><p>The only challenge is that said rover and rocket haven&#39;t been built yet and <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-exploration/missions/mars-sample-return/">don&#39;t even have</a> a finished design. However, the agencies involved plan to launch it to Mars by 2026, with arrival there by 2028. They don&#39;t expect to receive the samples until 2031, and suffice to say, all of those phases of the Perseverance project will be a huge challenge.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasa-confirms-that-perseverance-successfully-cored-its-first-rock-153007472.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a218d8b4-a60e-4c02-b588-602f6bbde0d3</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 15:30:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630940304</ingested><modified>2021-09-06T14:58:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7366a350-0f1c-11ec-bf58-8520f9bf7614" width="1608" height="956" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7366a350-0f1c-11ec-bf58-8520f9bf7614" width="1608" height="956" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NASA successfully samples Perseverance core]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA successfully samples Perseverance core]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon is running a Labor Day sale on Kindles and Fire tablets]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://engadget.com/tag/amazon">Amazon</a> is offering discounts on a swathe of Kindles and Fire tablets for Labor Day.

If you disregard the mild camouflage and lidar stack on top, you can finally get a good picture of how the production ID.Buzz, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-electric-microbus-release-date-us-europe-id-buzz-173557828.html">due to hit the US in 2023</a>, will look.&nbsp;</p><p>The electric minivan looks a bit more practical though less fun than the original concept. The rounded lines meant to evoke the classic &#39;70s VW van have been squared off, and the bulgy fenders are considerably less so. It also appears, though it&#39;s hard to confirm with the camouflage, that VW has changed the concept&#39;s funky rear window configuration. Still, it does bear a resemblance, especially from the front-side angle where it looks the best. Seen with a driver, one also gets a sense of the ID.Buzz&#39;s relatively small size.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2cb05610-0f10-11ec-b81e-813a2f72a24f" alt="Volkswagen&#39;s ID.Buzz electric minivan appears as a self-driving prototype" data-uuid="36956bbc-5563-3ced-952b-1bb3b9e62e15"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volkswagen</div></figure><p>As far as the autonomous tech goes, VW plans to use it in cities first as autonomous shuttles or for deliveries. Argo&#39;s AI system packs cameras, lidar modules, radar and an onboard computer to let it &quot;see&quot; up to 400 meters ahead for obstacles.&nbsp;</p><p>Argo AI founder Bryan Salensky said that the system can navigate with or without GPS and can work without changes to roads and infrastructure. Its sensor array will allow it to &quot;predict the actions of pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles, and direct the engine, braking and steering systems so that the vehicle moves safely and naturally,&quot; Argo said.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/46cb3a60-0f10-11ec-bfff-3d8c711843e1" alt="Volkswagen&#39;s ID.Buzz electric minivan appears as a self-driving prototype" data-uuid="8be6958b-7158-32ee-b539-78e7d73c26fd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">VW</div></figure><p>We have heard this tune before, though, and there are still no real self-driving cars plying city streets and highways.

The automaker&#39;s <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/usa/article/detail/T0341640EN_US?language=en_US">i Vision Circular</a> EV hatch is a highly futuristic vehicle both inside and out, and a preview of BMW&#39;s dream of sustainable vehicles way ahead in the year 2040.&nbsp;</p><p>The i Vision Circular is relatively small on the outside at 157 inches (smaller than a 2-series), but spacious inside thanks to the EV platform and a smaller and lighter solid state battery. The body looks relatively aerodynamic but has a blunt grill along with geometric edges and embedded shapes rather than rounded contours. The concept comes with a light gold anodized finish that shifts to a heat-treated blue toward the back.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/73617e90-0eed-11ec-bbff-ecd8a44c17e5" alt="BMW&#39;s &#39;recyclable&#39; i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface" data-uuid="90cacab2-399a-3798-9662-b14038e18334"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>More important is how it&#39;s built. BMW avoided using composite materials and bonded connections to make the EV easier to break down at the end of its life. Rather, it&#39;s built mostly with recycled aluminum and uses quick-release fasteners, press studs and cords so recyclers will be able to take it apart easily. As a result, the i Vision Circular is 100 percent recyclable, according to BMW.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a6e4c010-0eed-11ec-b95d-9f452b0b64f8" alt="BMW&#39;s &#39;recyclable&#39; i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface" data-uuid="d2937c69-f950-3882-a8bd-5d41842cc90c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>If you think the outside is far-fetched, wait until you get a load of the interior. The seats use a recycled, crushed-velvet like material with a pink-violet color and light mint green for the door panels and dash. Apart from the rear quarter panels, the cabin is nearly all glass including the highly sloped windshield and roof.&nbsp;</p><p>That brings us to the V-shaped dashboard, which looks like someone splashed blue liquid metal onto it. In fact, it&#39;s a 3D-printed crystal sculpture that uses lighting to simulate the vehicle &quot;thinking,&quot; according to BMW. Meanwhile, driver information appears on a heads-up display along the entire width of the windshield, while control comes via a pair of steering-wheel mounted touchpads with the same crystal appearance. Each seat has its own &quot;dedicated sound zone&quot; that allows passengers to listen to their own music — a techie, but rather antisocial touch.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cf61be0-0eed-11ec-b5f8-f9beb0bad1df" alt="BMW&#39;s &#39;recyclable&#39; i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface" data-uuid="e7c62c1d-ed44-3b0e-8bb2-8114aa8a3570"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>While the design is fairly bonkers, the i Vision Circular concept does offer some practical ideas. BMW aims to show how it can boost the amount of recycled materials in cars from 30 percent today to 50 percent and higher down the road. That&#39;s an application that might appear in the nearer future, even if the crystal interior is still a long way off.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bm-ws-recyclable-i-vision-cirulcar-concept-has-a-very-weird-crystal-interface-085205690.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc9eb6c2-1b7e-4ca9-83f3-6e2c1139d170</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 08:52:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630937217</ingested><modified>2021-09-06T14:07:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4e139330-0ee8-11ec-bbfe-05a2a56d00fa" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4e139330-0ee8-11ec-bbfe-05a2a56d00fa" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BMW's 'recyclable' i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BMW's 'recyclable' i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Smart's Mini-like EV concept shows off its larger vehicle ambitions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2019, Mercedes <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/315724/daimler-geely-joint-venture-smart/">teamed up</a> with Volvo automaker Geely to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-06-smart-eq-fortwo-forfour.html">transform Smart</a> into an EV-only brand with new vehicles to arrive in 2022.

A group of 11 House Republicans has <a href="https://biggs.house.gov/media/press-releases/congressman-biggs-sends-letter-companies-condemning-democrats-request-private">sent letters</a> to the leaders of 13 tech companies threatening legal action if they comply with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-select-committee-social-media-company-records-demand-211356022.html">request for records</a> related to the January 6th Capitol attack. However, there&#39;s one major problem. The letter to Yahoo (Engadget&#39;s parent company) is addressed to Marissa Mayer, who hasn&#39;t been CEO of the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-13-verizon-yahoo-acquisition-complete.html">since 2017</a>.

As you might guess, this is a electric take on the G-Class SUV, mating an &quot;uncompromising&quot; (and boxy) off-road design with an eco-friendly electric powertrain.</p><p>The company hasn&#39;t detailed the battery, motor system or even the interior. There are no mentions of when it might ship. However, it said this was a &quot;near-production&quot; design that would go through the same Schöckl mountain torture test as its ancestors. The instant torque and low center of gravity inherent to EVs should work in the EQG&#39;s favor when climbing hills and rough terrain, Mercedes said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a68e1930-0e6c-11ec-af5e-331af01db186" alt="Mercedes-Benz EQE electric sedan" data-uuid="a8c09290-84c1-3e71-8917-32e403fd6033"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daimler</div></figure><p>There are EVs closer on the horizon, of course. Mercedes has finally <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/The-essential-information-and-innovations.xhtml?oid=51155343">detailed</a> the EQE (second from top), its electric equivalent to the E-Class. It appears at first blush to be a shrunken version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-first-drive-video-220117807.html">EQS luxury sedan</a>, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. You&#39;re still getting a highly aerodynamic design and long range (a claimed 410 miles on the not-quite-realistic WLTP cycle), just in a smaller, CLS-sized design that should be easier to navigate around town.</p><p>The EQE 350 launch model will include a rear motor, a 90kW battery and reach 60MPH in a claimed 5.6 seconds. Performance versions are in the pipeline, according to Mercedes. However, the EQS&#39; signature dash-length &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html">Hyperscreen</a>&quot; is strictly optional here — you&#39;ll normally get a more conventional 12.8-inch OLED infotainment display.</p><p>The EQE will have a &quot;staggered&quot; worldwide launch starting in mid-2022. Mercedes hasn&#39;t divulged pricing, although we&#39;d expect it to cost more than the $54,250 of the combustion engine E-Class.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a84781a0-0e6f-11ec-9ef4-8415bda92ad3" alt="Mercedes-Maybach Concept EQS electric SUV" data-uuid="59e75456-533d-319a-8ed5-b25f48aec1cc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daimler</div></figure><p>And yes, there are already <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51166803&amp;ls=L3NlYXJjaHJlc3VsdC9zZWFyY2hyZXN1bHQueGh0bWw_c2VhcmNoVHlwZT1mbGV4JnNlYXJjaFN0cmluZz1OTVNfRmxleFNlYXJjaF9DdXJyZW50TmV3cyZyZXN1bHRJbmZvVHlwZUlkPTQwNjI2JmZsZXhJbmZvVHlwZXM9NDA2MjYlMkM0MDYzMA!!&amp;rs=2">ultra-luxurious</a> and <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51165592&amp;ls=L3NlYXJjaHJlc3VsdC9zZWFyY2hyZXN1bHQueGh0bWw_c2VhcmNoVHlwZT1mbGV4JnNlYXJjaFN0cmluZz1OTVNfRmxleFNlYXJjaF9DdXJyZW50TmV3cyZyZXN1bHRJbmZvVHlwZUlkPTQwNjI2JmZsZXhJbmZvVHlwZXM9NDA2MjYlMkM0MDYzMA!!&amp;rs=1">high-performance</a> versions of the EQS. A Mercedes-Maybach Concept EQS (second from bottom) offers an electric SUV for customers who&#39;d rather have a chauffeur for their eco-friendly transportation. Another near-production vehicle, it takes on the signature two-tone styling and other cues of a Maybach along with lounge-like rear seating and a Maybach-oriented Hyperscreen up front. Mercedes was once again shy on performance and release dates, although it noted the related EQS SUV is expected to net around a 373-mile range and go into production in 2022.</p><p>If you&#39;re more inclined to take the helm, the Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ (bottom) is the brand&#39;s first AMG-badged EV and includes custom motors that promise up to 761HP, 742lb/ft of torque and a 0-60MPH time of 3.4 seconds — brisk for a large luxury sedan. You&#39;ll also find an AMG GT-derived air suspension and rear-wheel steering. You won&#39;t see too many visual differences, although the unique rims and optional carbon ceramic rotors will make your go-fast intentions clear. Mercedes hasn&#39;t outlined pricing or release dates here, either, although it&#39;s safe to presume this will make the regular EQS line seem frugal.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e55e0440-0e71-11ec-8fcd-5f4b25db4e66" alt="Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ electric sedan" data-uuid="4b79ddda-e973-37ec-88b2-6f96f87a1753"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daimler</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-concept-eqg-eqe-175231108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e686102-4889-42d1-aa22-3e94eff708d9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 17:52:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630937257</ingested><modified>2021-09-06T14:07:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/524ccd50-0e6a-11ec-8963-519dca8aa199" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/524ccd50-0e6a-11ec-8963-519dca8aa199" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daimler]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz Concept EQG electric SUV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz Concept EQG electric SUV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pixel 3 owners say their phones are bricking without warning]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More and more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-15-google-pixel-3-pixel-3-xl-review-android-pie.html">Pixel 3</a> owners are grappling with a problem that can render their phones useless. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/reports-of-pixel-3s-bricking-with-edl-message-are-growing/">According</a> to <em>Ars Technica</em>, growing numbers of Pixel 3 and 3 XL users on Google&#39;s <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/192008282">IssueTracker</a>, the company&#39;s <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/113517096/pixel-3-xl-bricked-overnight-computer-recognizes-as-qusb-bulk-cid-likely-caused-by-security-update?hl=en">support forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/mmcn93/my_pixel_3_xl_bricked_overnight/">Reddit</a> say their phones are &#39;bricking&#39; (that is, becoming completely unresponsive) with little to no warning.

As <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/05/apple-watch-series-7-announcement-bloomberg/">reports</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claims in his &quot;Power On&quot; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a> that emergency satellite calls and messages on the future iPhone (potentially named iPhone 13) will only work in &quot;select markets,&quot; and then only in places without cellular coverage. This likely won&#39;t serve as a backup when cell service is spotty in your area, then.</p><p>Apple reportedly wants to launch its own satellites to provide more data coverage, but any plans for that are &quot;years away,&quot; Gurman said. You also won&#39;t get to make non-emergency calls any time soon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The limitations wouldn&#39;t be completely surprising. The new iPhone is rumored to use a modified Qualcomm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-18-qualcomm-snapdragon-x60-5g-mmwave-qtm535-ultrasaw-rf-filter.html">X60 modem</a> for satellite service — it might not be ready to serve as a full-featured satellite phone. Gurman added that costs and carrier objections might prevent Apple from offering a true satellite phone that bypasses conventional networks.</p><p>As it stands, there are other reasons to moderate your hopes for Apple&#39;s next event. Gurman also says display issues could limit availability for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-larger-screen-sizes-213316597.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a>. While the wristwear will reportedly debut alongside the next iPhone, some versions of it may be available &quot;late or in small quantities.&quot; Your preferred case and band combo may take a while to ship. While this isn&#39;t as bad as the delays that stalled the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">iPhone 12</a> and other Apple products last year, it could be a far cry from the smooth launches in the pre-pandemic era.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-satellite-limited-coverage-152109533.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">76afa768-e16f-4eca-91e9-f9f3d2fc35d6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 15:21:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630855272</ingested><modified>2021-09-05T15:21:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/76530a60-0e57-11ec-bfbe-e00a3819d92b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/76530a60-0e57-11ec-bfbe-e00a3819d92b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max handheld]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max handheld]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Horizon Forbidden West' PS4 buyers will get a free PS5 upgrade after all]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony won&#39;t make you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-ps5-pre-order-details-193232855.html">pay to upgrade <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a> after all. The company&#39;s Interactive Entertainment chief Jim Ryan <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/04/pre-order-horizon-forbidden-west-now-collectors-and-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/">announced</a> that <em>Forbidden West</em> PS4 players will get to upgrade to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html">PS5</a> version for free, as Sony <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-sony-playstation-4-215249430.html">promised last September</a>. The tech giant &quot;missed the mark&quot; and will stand by its original pledge, Ryan said.</p><p>The change of heart comes after Sony and Guerilla told customers they&#39;d be limited to the version of the game they bought. If you started on PS4, in other words, you&#39;d have to buy another copy to take advantage of PS5 features.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Don&#39;t expect a similar concession for other PS4-to-PS5 upgrades. Ryan made clear that all first-party cross-generation exclusives &quot;moving forward&quot; would include a $10 upgrade option for the PS5 edition. If you pick up the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-next-god-of-war-wont-be-out-until-2022-174822630.html">next <em>God of War</em></a> for your PS4, you&#39;ll still have to pay for the PS5 release — you just won&#39;t have to pay nearly as much.</p><p>This pricing won&#39;t affect third-party studios, some of which have offered free PS5 updates (such as for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-ps5-xbox-series-xs-release-date-034555281.html"><em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em></a>). However, it does set expectations.

The developer reclaimed the publishing rights to <em>Alan Wake</em> in 2019, however, and signalled its platform independence with the launch of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-13-control-hands-on-e3-2019.html"><em>Control</em></a> on PlayStation and (eventually) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/control-hitman-3-switch-cloud-streaming-155306591.html">the Nintendo Switch</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The studio will still support Microsoft with exclusives like the online shooter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/crossfirex-delayed-2021-223000436.html"><em>CrossfireX</em></a>.

The agency has <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-begins-air-taxi-flight-testing-with-joby">started</a> flight testing with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-16-toyota-flying-taxi-joby-investment.html">Joby Aviation&#39;s</a> electric VTOL aircraft to help model and simulate future airspace with these taxis in service.

The effort will include noise check using 50 microphones to gauge the &quot;acoustic profile&quot; of the air taxi throughout the course of a given flight.</p><p>This is the first eVTOL test as part of an Advanced Air Mobility campaign meant to spot gaps in the Federal Aviation Administration&#39;s rules and ensure the agency is ready for commercial use of flying taxis alongside <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hans-vestberg-5g-ces-2021-keynote-072021484.html">delivery drones</a> and other unconventional aircraft.

The 55 percent emissions reduction goal was a significant leap from the earlier 40 percent target. Enel also has a strong incentive here — additional spending would likely help Enel&#39;s renewable energy business. The findings might help quantify just how much work needs to be done, however, and the EU may well listen to a major energy supplier when it asks for more aggressive clean energy adoption.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/europe-21-years-behind-emissions-goals-enel-study-180121943.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd4e63d7-2a12-47d8-b5f2-78a085d39843</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 18:01:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630778484</ingested><modified>2021-09-04T18:01:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Nature & Environment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ff709a50-0da4-11ec-9bff-7b0b2f1c6e7c" width="3500" height="2386" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ff709a50-0da4-11ec-9bff-7b0b2f1c6e7c" width="3500" height="2386" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Srdjan Zivulovic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Smoke billows from a chimney of the Termika factory, which produces glass wool, in Skojfa Loka January 21, 2010.

That&#39;s two years longer than a recent Commission proposal, and would effectively give phones a more computer-like support cycle.</p><p>Both proposals are unsurprisingly facing pushback from manufacturers. The industry advocacy group DigitalEurope (which counts Apple, Google and Samsung as some of its members) wants a requirement for just three years of security updates, and wants to limit spare parts to screens and batteries rather than cameras, speakers and other components that are supposedly more reliable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DigitalEurope is effectively arguing for the status quo, in other words. While Apple typically delivers five years of regular feature and security updates, many Android vendors stop at three or less. Samsung only committed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-four-years-security-updates-152303907.html">four years of security fixes</a> in 2021. Some of this has been dictated by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-qualcomm-snapdragon-project-treble-partnership-000040338.html">Qualcomm&#39;s update policy</a>, but it&#39;s clear the brands themselves are sometimes reluctant to change.</p><p>This extended support might become crucial. The EU&#39;s proposal, potentially in effect by 2023, is meant to help the environment by letting you keep phones for longer. They&#39;d stay protected and functional for roughly twice the 2.5 to 3.5 years you see today.</p><p>However, this could also be vital for bolstering mobile security as a whole. Just over 40 percent of Android users are running <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-17-android-9-pie-review.html">9.0 Pie</a> or earlier, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/android-version-market-share/mobile-tablet/worldwide">according</a> to StatCounter&#39;s August 2021 usage share data — a large portion of mobile users have devices that either stopped receiving security updates or are close to losing them. Longer support periods could prevent attackers from targeting old phones that, at present, have been left permanently vulnerable to exploits patched in newer software.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/germany-phone-makers-7-years-security-updates-163601435.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3623a7a3-eae0-46f6-bc16-1c974245d71e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 16:36:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630773365</ingested><modified>2021-09-04T16:36:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7c269990-0d97-11ec-bf2f-32fb211ca9fb" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7c269990-0d97-11ec-bf2f-32fb211ca9fb" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[sigoisette via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Installing update on smartphone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Installing update on smartphone]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
