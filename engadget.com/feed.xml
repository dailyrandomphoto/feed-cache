If you disregard the mild camouflage and lidar stack on top, you can finally get a good picture of how the production ID.Buzz, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/vw-electric-microbus-release-date-us-europe-id-buzz-173557828.html">due to hit the US in 2023</a>, will look.&nbsp;</p><p>The electric minivan looks a bit more practical though less fun than the original concept. The rounded lines meant to evoke the classic &#39;70s VW van have been squared off, and the bulgy fenders are considerably less so. It also appears, though it&#39;s hard to confirm with the camouflage, that VW has changed the concept&#39;s funky rear window configuration. Still, it does bear a resemblance, especially from the front-side angle where it looks the best. Seen with a driver, one also gets a sense of the ID.Buzz&#39;s relatively small size.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2cb05610-0f10-11ec-b81e-813a2f72a24f" alt="Volkswagen&#39;s ID.Buzz electric minivan appears as a self-driving prototype" data-uuid="36956bbc-5563-3ced-952b-1bb3b9e62e15"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Volkswagen</div></figure><p>As far as the autonomous tech goes, VW plans to use it in cities first as autonomous shuttles or for deliveries. Argo&#39;s AI system packs cameras, lidar modules, radar and an onboard computer to let it &quot;see&quot; up to 400 meters ahead for obstacles.&nbsp;</p><p>Argo AI founder Bryan Salensky said that the system can navigate with or without GPS and can work without changes to roads and infrastructure. Its sensor array will allow it to &quot;predict the actions of pedestrians, bicyclists and vehicles, and direct the engine, braking and steering systems so that the vehicle moves safely and naturally,&quot; Argo said.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/46cb3a60-0f10-11ec-bfff-3d8c711843e1" alt="Volkswagen&#39;s ID.Buzz electric minivan appears as a self-driving prototype" data-uuid="8be6958b-7158-32ee-b539-78e7d73c26fd"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">VW</div></figure><p>We have heard this tune before, though, and there are still no real self-driving cars plying city streets and highways.

The automaker&#39;s <a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/usa/article/detail/T0341640EN_US?language=en_US">i Vision Circular</a> EV hatch is a highly futuristic vehicle both inside and out, and a preview of BMW&#39;s dream of sustainable vehicles way ahead in the year 2040.&nbsp;</p><p>The i Vision Circular is relatively small on the outside at 157 inches (smaller than a 2-series), but spacious inside thanks to the EV platform and a smaller and lighter solid state battery. The body looks relatively aerodynamic but has a blunt grill along with geometric edges and embedded shapes rather than rounded contours. The concept comes with a light gold anodized finish that shifts to a heat-treated blue toward the back.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/73617e90-0eed-11ec-bbff-ecd8a44c17e5" alt="BMW&#39;s &#39;recyclable&#39; i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface" data-uuid="90cacab2-399a-3798-9662-b14038e18334"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>More important is how it&#39;s built. BMW avoided using composite materials and bonded connections to make the EV easier to break down at the end of its life. Rather, it&#39;s built mostly with recycled aluminum and uses quick-release fasteners, press studs and cords so recyclers will be able to take it apart easily. As a result, the i Vision Circular is 100 percent recyclable, according to BMW.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a6e4c010-0eed-11ec-b95d-9f452b0b64f8" alt="BMW&#39;s &#39;recyclable&#39; i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface" data-uuid="d2937c69-f950-3882-a8bd-5d41842cc90c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>If you think the outside is far-fetched, wait until you get a load of the interior. The seats use a recycled, crushed-velvet like material with a pink-violet color and light mint green for the door panels and dash. Apart from the rear quarter panels, the cabin is nearly all glass including the highly sloped windshield and roof.&nbsp;</p><p>That brings us to the V-shaped dashboard, which looks like someone splashed blue liquid metal onto it. In fact, it&#39;s a 3D-printed crystal sculpture that uses lighting to simulate the vehicle &quot;thinking,&quot; according to BMW. Meanwhile, driver information appears on a heads-up display along the entire width of the windshield, while control comes via a pair of steering-wheel mounted touchpads with the same crystal appearance. Each seat has its own &quot;dedicated sound zone&quot; that allows passengers to listen to their own music — a techie, but rather antisocial touch.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/8cf61be0-0eed-11ec-b5f8-f9beb0bad1df" alt="BMW&#39;s &#39;recyclable&#39; i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface" data-uuid="e7c62c1d-ed44-3b0e-8bb2-8114aa8a3570"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">BMW</div></figure><p>While the design is fairly bonkers, the i Vision Circular concept does offer some practical ideas. BMW aims to show how it can boost the amount of recycled materials in cars from 30 percent today to 50 percent and higher down the road. That&#39;s an application that might appear in the nearer future, even if the crystal interior is still a long way off.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bm-ws-recyclable-i-vision-cirulcar-concept-has-a-very-weird-crystal-interface-085205690.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bc9eb6c2-1b7e-4ca9-83f3-6e2c1139d170</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 06 Sep 2021 08:52:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630937217</ingested><modified>2021-09-06T14:07:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4e139330-0ee8-11ec-bbfe-05a2a56d00fa" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4e139330-0ee8-11ec-bbfe-05a2a56d00fa" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BMW's 'recyclable' i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[BMW's 'recyclable' i Vision Circular Concept EV has a weird crystal interface]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Smart's Mini-like EV concept shows off its larger vehicle ambitions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2019, Mercedes <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/315724/daimler-geely-joint-venture-smart/">teamed up</a> with Volvo automaker Geely to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-06-smart-eq-fortwo-forfour.html">transform Smart</a> into an EV-only brand with new vehicles to arrive in 2022.

As you might guess, this is a electric take on the G-Class SUV, mating an &quot;uncompromising&quot; (and boxy) off-road design with an eco-friendly electric powertrain.</p><p>The company hasn&#39;t detailed the battery, motor system or even the interior. There are no mentions of when it might ship. However, it said this was a &quot;near-production&quot; design that would go through the same Schöckl mountain torture test as its ancestors. The instant torque and low center of gravity inherent to EVs should work in the EQG&#39;s favor when climbing hills and rough terrain, Mercedes said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a68e1930-0e6c-11ec-af5e-331af01db186" alt="Mercedes-Benz EQE electric sedan" data-uuid="a8c09290-84c1-3e71-8917-32e403fd6033"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daimler</div></figure><p>There are EVs closer on the horizon, of course. Mercedes has finally <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko/The-essential-information-and-innovations.xhtml?oid=51155343">detailed</a> the EQE (second from top), its electric equivalent to the E-Class. It appears at first blush to be a shrunken version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-eqs-ev-first-drive-video-220117807.html">EQS luxury sedan</a>, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing. You&#39;re still getting a highly aerodynamic design and long range (a claimed 410 miles on the not-quite-realistic WLTP cycle), just in a smaller, CLS-sized design that should be easier to navigate around town.</p><p>The EQE 350 launch model will include a rear motor, a 90kW battery and reach 60MPH in a claimed 5.6 seconds. Performance versions are in the pipeline, according to Mercedes. However, the EQS&#39; signature dash-length &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-mbux-hyperscreen-eqs-161520472.html">Hyperscreen</a>&quot; is strictly optional here — you&#39;ll normally get a more conventional 12.8-inch OLED infotainment display.</p><p>The EQE will have a &quot;staggered&quot; worldwide launch starting in mid-2022. Mercedes hasn&#39;t divulged pricing, although we&#39;d expect it to cost more than the $54,250 of the combustion engine E-Class.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a84781a0-0e6f-11ec-9ef4-8415bda92ad3" alt="Mercedes-Maybach Concept EQS electric SUV" data-uuid="59e75456-533d-319a-8ed5-b25f48aec1cc"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daimler</div></figure><p>And yes, there are already <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51166803&amp;ls=L3NlYXJjaHJlc3VsdC9zZWFyY2hyZXN1bHQueGh0bWw_c2VhcmNoVHlwZT1mbGV4JnNlYXJjaFN0cmluZz1OTVNfRmxleFNlYXJjaF9DdXJyZW50TmV3cyZyZXN1bHRJbmZvVHlwZUlkPTQwNjI2JmZsZXhJbmZvVHlwZXM9NDA2MjYlMkM0MDYzMA!!&amp;rs=2">ultra-luxurious</a> and <a href="https://media.daimler.com/marsMediaSite/en/instance/ko.xhtml?oid=51165592&amp;ls=L3NlYXJjaHJlc3VsdC9zZWFyY2hyZXN1bHQueGh0bWw_c2VhcmNoVHlwZT1mbGV4JnNlYXJjaFN0cmluZz1OTVNfRmxleFNlYXJjaF9DdXJyZW50TmV3cyZyZXN1bHRJbmZvVHlwZUlkPTQwNjI2JmZsZXhJbmZvVHlwZXM9NDA2MjYlMkM0MDYzMA!!&amp;rs=1">high-performance</a> versions of the EQS. A Mercedes-Maybach Concept EQS (second from bottom) offers an electric SUV for customers who&#39;d rather have a chauffeur for their eco-friendly transportation. Another near-production vehicle, it takes on the signature two-tone styling and other cues of a Maybach along with lounge-like rear seating and a Maybach-oriented Hyperscreen up front. Mercedes was once again shy on performance and release dates, although it noted the related EQS SUV is expected to net around a 373-mile range and go into production in 2022.</p><p>If you&#39;re more inclined to take the helm, the Mercedes-AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ (bottom) is the brand&#39;s first AMG-badged EV and includes custom motors that promise up to 761HP, 742lb/ft of torque and a 0-60MPH time of 3.4 seconds — brisk for a large luxury sedan. You&#39;ll also find an AMG GT-derived air suspension and rear-wheel steering. You won&#39;t see too many visual differences, although the unique rims and optional carbon ceramic rotors will make your go-fast intentions clear. Mercedes hasn&#39;t outlined pricing or release dates here, either, although it&#39;s safe to presume this will make the regular EQS line seem frugal.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e55e0440-0e71-11ec-8fcd-5f4b25db4e66" alt="Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS 53 4MATIC+ electric sedan" data-uuid="4b79ddda-e973-37ec-88b2-6f96f87a1753"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daimler</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mercedes-benz-concept-eqg-eqe-175231108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5e686102-4889-42d1-aa22-3e94eff708d9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 17:52:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630937257</ingested><modified>2021-09-06T14:07:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/524ccd50-0e6a-11ec-8963-519dca8aa199" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/524ccd50-0e6a-11ec-8963-519dca8aa199" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daimler]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz Concept EQG electric SUV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mercedes-Benz Concept EQG electric SUV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Pixel 3 owners say their phones are bricking without warning]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>More and more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-10-15-google-pixel-3-pixel-3-xl-review-android-pie.html">Pixel 3</a> owners are grappling with a problem that can render their phones useless. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/reports-of-pixel-3s-bricking-with-edl-message-are-growing/">According</a> to <em>Ars Technica</em>, growing numbers of Pixel 3 and 3 XL users on Google&#39;s <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/192008282">IssueTracker</a>, the company&#39;s <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/113517096/pixel-3-xl-bricked-overnight-computer-recognizes-as-qusb-bulk-cid-likely-caused-by-security-update?hl=en">support forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/mmcn93/my_pixel_3_xl_bricked_overnight/">Reddit</a> say their phones are &#39;bricking&#39; (that is, becoming completely unresponsive) with little to no warning.

As <em>9to5Mac</em><a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/05/apple-watch-series-7-announcement-bloomberg/">reports</a>, <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claims in his &quot;Power On&quot; <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/account/newsletters/power-on">newsletter</a> that emergency satellite calls and messages on the future iPhone (potentially named iPhone 13) will only work in &quot;select markets,&quot; and then only in places without cellular coverage. This likely won&#39;t serve as a backup when cell service is spotty in your area, then.</p><p>Apple reportedly wants to launch its own satellites to provide more data coverage, but any plans for that are &quot;years away,&quot; Gurman said. You also won&#39;t get to make non-emergency calls any time soon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The limitations wouldn&#39;t be completely surprising. The new iPhone is rumored to use a modified Qualcomm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-18-qualcomm-snapdragon-x60-5g-mmwave-qtm535-ultrasaw-rf-filter.html">X60 modem</a> for satellite service — it might not be ready to serve as a full-featured satellite phone. Gurman added that costs and carrier objections might prevent Apple from offering a true satellite phone that bypasses conventional networks.</p><p>As it stands, there are other reasons to moderate your hopes for Apple&#39;s next event. Gurman also says display issues could limit availability for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-larger-screen-sizes-213316597.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a>. While the wristwear will reportedly debut alongside the next iPhone, some versions of it may be available &quot;late or in small quantities.&quot; Your preferred case and band combo may take a while to ship. While this isn&#39;t as bad as the delays that stalled the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">iPhone 12</a> and other Apple products last year, it could be a far cry from the smooth launches in the pre-pandemic era.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-satellite-limited-coverage-152109533.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">76afa768-e16f-4eca-91e9-f9f3d2fc35d6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 05 Sep 2021 15:21:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630855272</ingested><modified>2021-09-05T15:21:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/76530a60-0e57-11ec-bfbe-e00a3819d92b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/76530a60-0e57-11ec-bfbe-e00a3819d92b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max handheld]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max handheld]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Horizon Forbidden West' PS4 buyers will get a free PS5 upgrade after all]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony won&#39;t make you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-ps4-ps5-pre-order-details-193232855.html">pay to upgrade <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a> after all. The company&#39;s Interactive Entertainment chief Jim Ryan <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/04/pre-order-horizon-forbidden-west-now-collectors-and-digital-deluxe-editions-detailed/">announced</a> that <em>Forbidden West</em> PS4 players will get to upgrade to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html">PS5</a> version for free, as Sony <a href="https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-sony-playstation-4-215249430.html">promised last September</a>. The tech giant &quot;missed the mark&quot; and will stand by its original pledge, Ryan said.</p><p>The change of heart comes after Sony and Guerilla told customers they&#39;d be limited to the version of the game they bought. If you started on PS4, in other words, you&#39;d have to buy another copy to take advantage of PS5 features.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Don&#39;t expect a similar concession for other PS4-to-PS5 upgrades. Ryan made clear that all first-party cross-generation exclusives &quot;moving forward&quot; would include a $10 upgrade option for the PS5 edition. If you pick up the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-next-god-of-war-wont-be-out-until-2022-174822630.html">next <em>God of War</em></a> for your PS4, you&#39;ll still have to pay for the PS5 release — you just won&#39;t have to pay nearly as much.</p><p>This pricing won&#39;t affect third-party studios, some of which have offered free PS5 updates (such as for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-ps5-xbox-series-xs-release-date-034555281.html"><em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em></a>). However, it does set expectations.

The 55 percent emissions reduction goal was a significant leap from the earlier 40 percent target.

That&#39;s two years longer than a recent Commission proposal, and would effectively give phones a more computer-like support cycle.</p><p>Both proposals are unsurprisingly facing pushback from manufacturers. The industry advocacy group DigitalEurope (which counts Apple, Google and Samsung as some of its members) wants a requirement for just three years of security updates, and wants to limit spare parts to screens and batteries rather than cameras, speakers and other components that are supposedly more reliable.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DigitalEurope is effectively arguing for the status quo, in other words. While Apple typically delivers five years of regular feature and security updates, many Android vendors stop at three or less. Samsung only committed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-four-years-security-updates-152303907.html">four years of security fixes</a> in 2021. Some of this has been dictated by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-qualcomm-snapdragon-project-treble-partnership-000040338.html">Qualcomm&#39;s update policy</a>, but it&#39;s clear the brands themselves are sometimes reluctant to change.</p><p>This extended support might become crucial. The EU&#39;s proposal, potentially in effect by 2023, is meant to help the environment by letting you keep phones for longer. They&#39;d stay protected and functional for roughly twice the 2.5 to 3.5 years you see today.</p><p>However, this could also be vital for bolstering mobile security as a whole. Just over 40 percent of Android users are running <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-17-android-9-pie-review.html">9.0 Pie</a> or earlier, <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/android-version-market-share/mobile-tablet/worldwide">according</a> to StatCounter&#39;s August 2021 usage share data — a large portion of mobile users have devices that either stopped receiving security updates or are close to losing them. Longer support periods could prevent attackers from targeting old phones that, at present, have been left permanently vulnerable to exploits patched in newer software.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/germany-phone-makers-7-years-security-updates-163601435.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3623a7a3-eae0-46f6-bc16-1c974245d71e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 16:36:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630773365</ingested><modified>2021-09-04T16:36:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7c269990-0d97-11ec-bf2f-32fb211ca9fb" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/7c269990-0d97-11ec-bf2f-32fb211ca9fb" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[sigoisette via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Installing update on smartphone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Installing update on smartphone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[ICYMI: We see how the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 performs in the real world]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We checked out a couple of ambitious Samsung products this week, plus a few other gadgets. Cherlynn Low tested the Galaxy Z Fold 3 smartphone, which is the third generation of Samsung’s foldable hybrid, and the Galaxy Watch 4, which is one of the first devices to run on the new Wear OS platform. James Trew popped off keys and customized the Keychron Q1 keyboard, while Daniel Cooper was pleased with his time with HP’s light yet capable Pavilion Aero 13 laptop.</p><h2>The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">a stronger foldable than ever before</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/c668b7b0-0c19-11ec-bbf8-8d924aa84dc1" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-uuid="1864c6a5-3359-378b-a5d5-6140884bea50"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel For Engadget</div></figure><p>Although Cherlynn Low likes a lot of the improvements made to the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Z Fold 3" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">Galaxy Z Fold 3</a> and calls it an impressive piece of tech, she still isn’t sure it can replace a regular smartphone for most people. The third generation of the folding device has a stronger, redesigned screen, a streamlined hinge and a robust aluminum build, and Samsung says it’s 80 percent more durable than previous models. According to Cherlynn, it easily withstood being thrown in a purse full of sharp and heavy objects, and the IPX8 water-resistance kept it safe from water droplets.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Fold 3’s external 6.2-inch, 2,268 x 832 display refreshes at 120Hz and uses a Dynamic AMOLED panel, which made for fast scrolling and vibrant images. The phone also has S Pen support, although the stylus costs extra and there isn’t a slot for it on the device. There’s also more software support to improve the full-screen experience, like Multi Window and Flex Mode panels, plus five onboard cameras, which generally produced bright and colorful shots. Despite these wins, she felt that the device was over-reaching and attempting to do too much to achieve mainstream adoption.</p><h2>The Galaxy Watch 4 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-body-fat-scan-wear-os-120026149.html">shows off the new Wear OS platform</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/92d2ffa0-0c19-11ec-b9fd-fa08c9db60d9" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4" data-uuid="1538ae49-de39-3b44-bc8e-428b6e34e0c5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Cherlynn Low is candid about how the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Watch 4" href="https://fave.co/2WoM3D1">Galaxy Watch 4</a> makes her feel, calling it and the rest of Samsung’s smartwatches the best Android wearable options around. The combination of capable hardware with intuitive software features and comprehensive health tracking continue to provide a satisfying experience. The Galaxy Watch 4 adds some interesting marquee features with body composition scans and snore detection, but Cherlynn says she’ll need more time to determine how useful these features are as they are, for now, somewhat unreliable.</p><p>The Galaxy Watch 4 includes a sharp 1.4-inch screen with a 450 x 450 resolution, a touch sensitive rotating bezel, and an updated 5nm processor with more storage. It also supports gesture controls that allow you to respond to calls or messages, but Cherlynn says they don’t work very well yet. She was also disappointed with the watch’s battery life, which barely made it through a day. She was more impressed with how accurately and quickly it registered her walking, and she liked that the watch tracks 95 different workouts. She also was pleased that the Wear OS platform strongly echoed the intuitive UI strengths of Tizen, save for the new ability to download apps directly from the Play Store. Despite some hiccups, she’d still recommend the Galaxy Watch 4 or Watch 4 Classic to Android users.</p><h2>Keychron’s Q1 is an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/keychron-q-1-fully-customizable-keyboard-130015959.html">ambitious customizable keyboard</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/50b2bed0-0c19-11ec-bd5e-0917c09f2535" alt="Keychron Q1" data-uuid="edfc6f69-93bc-317c-9edf-cd2f9e241cf7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Keychron is known for making economical keyboards and James Trew says its newest offering, the <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1">Q1</a>, is affordable, easy to customize and full-featured. The Q1 has hot-swappable switches and an Aviator style USB-C, which should appeal to both avid tinkerers and those who are interested in getting deeper into the geeky details of mechanical keyboards. It comes with a keycap puller and a switch remover, plus keycaps for Windows and MacOS layouts, but it lacks Bluetooth so you’ll have to live with it as a wired peripheral.</p><p>The Q1 features the expected RGB key lighting, but has a south-facing integration for a more subtle effect. Inside are a noise-reducing foam deck and screw-in stabilizers for steadier keys. James particularly liked the option to etch a customized metal badge where the Insert key goes. He reported that swapping out keys was easy, and that using the companion Via app was a convenient way to customize the Q1. However, he points out that, at 3.5 pounds, the Q1 isn’t designed for portability and that its height cannot be adjusted.</p><h2>HP’s Pavilion Aero 13 is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hp-pavilion-aero-13-review-powerful-and-cheap-143034549.html">a compelling, thin-and-light laptop</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/ff9cd760-0c18-11ec-93fb-40fe5cf856b3" alt="HP Pavilion Aero 13" data-uuid="89a59e20-47ec-313e-a186-302d4eda58d5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper/Engadget</div></figure><p>Daniel Cooper found plenty of reasons to recommend <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HP&#x002019;s new Pavilion Aero" href="https://fave.co/3yjQsnQ">HP’s new Pavilion Aero</a>. The lightest laptop yet from the company weighs in at a mere 2.2 pounds and still manages to fit in a 13.3-inch, 16:10 display with 1,920 x 1,200 resolution. Rounding out the specs list on our review unit was AMD’s Ryzen 5800U with Radeon Integrated Graphics, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Daniel said the build quality is solid, save for the malleable display hinge; the keyboard is well-engineered and satisfying; and the trackpad has tolerable accuracy. He also approved of the battery, which lasted for 9 hours and 43 minutes during testing.</p><p>He was less thrilled that the keyboard wasn’t backlit by default, but you can pay $20 extra to get that. And while he was pleased by the performance of the WideVision 720p webcam, he said the downward-firing B&amp;O speakers pumped out audio you could put up with but not fully enjoy. The preinstalled software was another annoyance — getting pop-ups for plugins is never appreciated. Being a relatively affordable laptop, Aero isn’t set up for intensive gaming but Daniel was able to play <em>Fortnite </em>pretty smoothly with medium graphics power. Overall, he says the Aero is clearly punching above its weight and could almost be recommended as an alternative to the Dell XPS 13 for those with tighter budgets.</p><h2>The Razer Blade 14 is the perfect <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-blade-14-review-amd-ryzen-173003809.html">balance of portability and power</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bc38f300-0c18-11ec-bd76-116b917b690d" alt="Razer Blade 14" data-uuid="d00867d9-ddf7-3cec-a9d5-8b4a71454e2c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Razer&#x002019;s new 14-inch Blade laptop" href="https://fave.co/3t7TNFi">Razer’s new 14-inch Blade laptop</a> hits all the right notes for Devindra Hardawar: It’s plenty powerful thanks to an NVIDIA RTX 30-series GPU and AMD’s latest processor, and at just under four pounds, it’s still light enough to carry comfortably. Featuring a minimalistic design and a sleek black aluminum case, Devindra’s review unit came equipped with an RGB LED keyboard, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD and a quad-HD 165Hz display. He reports that the laptop easily handled demanding games even in maxed-out settings and that the ray tracing performance was solid.</p><p>Devindra also liked the responsiveness of the keyboard, but said the layout felt a bit cramped for longer gaming sessions. During battery testing, the Blade 14 made it 10 hours and 50 minutes (running productivity tasks, not games). But during heavy gaming sessions, Devindra reports that the CPU reached up to 94 degrees Celsius, which is unusually high. Another downside? The RAM isn’t upgradeable like it is in the larger Blade 15 and 17 laptops. He says if those compromises aren’t deal breakers, then this is worth recommending given its $1,800 starting price.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-see-how-the-samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-performs-in-the-real-world-160038668.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e9df2ab2-25bc-4160-9d3b-e12730cb7c15</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 16:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630609393</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T19:03:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/77e451c0-0751-11ec-b5e9-369516f4fa4e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/77e451c0-0751-11ec-b5e9-369516f4fa4e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A hand holding up the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 with its screen open and facing the camera.

Imagine the moment you discover a radio signal from another civilization had traveled billions of miles through interstellar space, had been detected by some of the most powerful radio telescopes in the world, and decoded by scientists. Would it matter if it was first detected by scientists from your home country? Would the content of the signal matter? Would you want the chance to be able to meet the alien civilization that sent the signal? These are all questions that the movie <em>Contact</em> explores.</p><p>The opening sequence of <em>Contact</em> sets the scientific basis for the rest of the film. As the camera travels away from Earth, the audience hears a cacophony of sounds. These sounds, which are radio and television signals traveling out into space, get older and older as we zoom past planets and asteroids. Eventually there is silence as the audience is taken into deep space and past beautiful sights like the Eagle Nebula. While the premise of the sequence has its basis in science, the scale is completely wrong.</p><p>Humanity has been transmitting television and radio signals into deep space for over a hundred years. These signals leave Earth and travel at the speed of light. This means that in one year, a signal will travel one light year into space. This has created what scientists call the “radio bubble,” an ever-expanding sphere with Earth at the center, that spans over 200 light years and announces humanity’s presence to the cosmos. These signals have gone well beyond our solar system and out to the nearest stars. However, our own solar system is small in comparison to this vast bubble since it spans just a few light hours across. That means, when <em>Contact</em> was released in 1997, our solar system would have still been listening to the greatest hits of 1997, like the number one Billboard song “I’ll Be Missing You” by Puff Daddy and Faith Evans, not broadcasts of the Kennedy assassination like we hear at Jupiter during the opening sequence. The closest star, Proxima Centauri, is only four light years away, which means any aliens on the planets orbiting Proxima Centauri would be singing along with Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You.” The television signal featuring Hitler at the 1936 Olympic games would have been traveling through space for 61 years, meaning any planet within 30 light years from Earth could have received the signal and sent it back to Earth. This includes more than 20 planets discovered as of 2019 and the all-important star of the film, Vega.</p><p>The story in <em>Contact</em> closely parallels the story of the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute (SETI). One of SETI’s first projects, Project Phoenix, used radio telescopes to search for narrow-band radio signals, or signals that are at only one spot on the radio dial. These are considered the “signature” of an “intelligent” radio transmission. Much like Dr. Arroway’s research, Project Phoenix heavily relied on existing radio telescopes, such as Arecibo. Despite this, Project Phoenix was still the world’s most sensitive and comprehensive search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Unfortunately, this dependence on existing equipment meant that there were multiple projects competing for observing time. Still, SETI was able to obtain two three-week observing sessions on Arecibo, the world’s largest radio telescope, each year between 1998 and 2005. Instead of broadly scanning the sky, Project Phoenix targeted Sun-like stars within 200 light years since they were believed to be the most likely stars to have a planet capable of supporting life, and thus possibly intelligent life. Nearly two billion channels were examined for each target star.</p><p>SETI faced funding woes much like Dr. Arroway. Less than a year after founding the program, NASA withdrew funds from SETI due to pressures. While there were, and still are, questions about whether we could find evidence of extraterrestrial life, most informed parties agreed that SETI was pursuing worthwhile and valid science. However, fervor to decrease the federal deficit and a lack of support from other scientists and aerospace contractors made it an easy program to cut. Since then, SETI has been dependent on foundations and private donors for funding.</p><p>We see this reflected in <em>Contact</em> in Dr. David Drumlin who often questions the value and chance of the success of Dr. Arroway’s search. Dr. Drumlin is the science equivalent of a mustache-twirling villain. He will tell politicians whatever they want to hear, is narrow minded with the power to make or break scientist’s careers with funding, and is the stereotypical patronizing “mansplainer” that makes him reprehensible to the audience, or at least to an audience of scientists. He represents the politicians and other scientists who often mocked SETI. “What’s wrong with science being practical, or even profitable?” he muses. There is no immediate return on a search for extraterrestrials and that is often the factor that determines what projects receive funding. This was especially true for national funding of science in the 1990s. During Dr. Drumlin’s visit we hear other scientists at Arecibo scrambling to justify their own research in hopes that they can keep their funding. Dr. Drumlin ultimately pulls the plug on Dr. Arroway’s funding from the National Science Foundation, forcing her to seek funding from private sources. Her research became dependent on funding from a private donor, S.R. Haden, much like SETI’s research.</p><p>SETI served as the inspiration for key scientists as well. Dr. Arroway was based on Dr. Jill Tarter, the former director of SETI and the person responsible for the fact that SETI even exists. Like Dr. Arroway, she was inspired and encouraged by her father to pursue engineering and science before he died when she was twelve. She had to elbow her way through school at a time when women didn’t pursue STEM careers and was often not respected by peers because searching for extraterrestrial intelligence was, and still can be, considered fringe. However, like Dr. Arroway, Dr. Tarter persisted and left behind an incredible legacy. Dr. Kent Clarke was based on Dr. Kent Cullers, a project manager for SETI. Dr. Cullers was the first blind student to earn a Ph.D. in physics in the United States and is believed to be the first astronomer who was blind from birth. He developed and implemented complex computer algorithms to sift through mountains of radio signals and search for one that might be from another civilization.</p><p>One key difference between Dr. Arroway and Dr. Clarke’s search in <em>Contact</em> and SETI is the telescopes they used. While both Dr. Arroway and SETI utilized Arecibo, SETI never used the Very Large Array in their search. Not only would this have been a significant drop in sensitivity (Arecibo has four-times the collecting area, so it would be more likely to be able to detect a faint signal), it would have created a logistical problem. Since the Very Large Array is made up of 27 radio dishes, this would have required 27 specially designed receivers (one for each telescope) which would have been impossible with SETI’s limited budget.</p><p>And forget trying to listen to all those radio signals. While Dr. Arroway sitting in the desert listening for a signal is one of the most iconic visuals of the film (and one visitors of the Very Large Array love to recreate) astronomers don’t listen to signals at all. During Project Phoenix, using only one radio dish, there were 28 million radio channels being monitored simultaneously. Headphones could only listen to one of these channels at a time so the chances of listening to the right channel when the signal arrives is “astronomically” small. Unfortunately, the life of a radio astronomer is not nearly as romantic. It involves a lot of sitting in a control room (with no Wi-Fi or cell phones since that could produce a signal radio telescopes could pick up) waiting for a computer (using complex programs, like those developed by SETI’s Dr. Cullers) to send an alert that there is an interesting signal. However, astronomers are required to make critical decisions about signals that look intriguing.</p><p>Much like radio signals we have broadcasted into space in hopes of contacting an alien civilization, scientists speculate that any signal we receive from an intelligent civilization would be distinct from other naturally occurring radio sources. This could be done with the content of the message, like the “Arecibo Message” sent in the 1970s which contained the numbers one through ten and information about our DNA. Certainly, prime numbers or information on how to build an advanced machine would qualify the signal in <em>Contact</em> and make it distinct. In reality, however, it could take years to decode the deeper signals so there needs to be something else to make scientists look twice at a signal.</p><p>The aliens in <em>Contact</em> do this by transmitting the signal at a very special frequency that wouldn’t occur naturally. This frequency, 4.4623 GHz is described as “hydrogen times pi (π).” The hydrogen line, which is a common observation in radio astronomy, is the frequency at which hydrogen atoms, the most abundant substance in space, emit radio waves (1420.40575 MHz). While there aren’t a lot of loose hydrogen atoms in space (about one per cubic centimeter of interstellar space) space is vast. So, the collection of all those individual atoms makes for a powerful signal that can be easily detected by small radio telescopes. By multiplying this frequency, that would be well known by scientists, by a mathematical constant, not only are they creating a signal that could not be naturally occurring (since pi is an irrational number), bit would also give the civilization on the receiving end clues to the scientific knowledge of the aliens that sent it. While this frequency isn’t inside the range of frequencies that was observed by SETI’s Project Phoenix, it is within Very Large Array’s observing range of 1–50 GHz.</p><p>Another clue that the signal in Contact was not likely to be one that was not from a typical astronomical source is its strength. The signal measured in at 100 Jansky (Jy). A Jansky is a unit used by radio astronomers to describe the “brightness” or strength of a signal. Celestial radio sources are much fainter than terrestrial and are just a few Jy in strength. So, this is a relatively strong signal. The Sun, the brightest celestial radio source is 106–108 Jy in most frequencies, depending on solar activity. Terrestrial radio broadcasts, such as those we listen to on FM radio can be a million to a trillion times brighter than the Sun. So, while strong by astronomical standards, this is still a very faint signal by terrestrial standards and would require a radio telescope to detect.</p><p>So, what would happen if a signal is detected? In Contact, we see mixed reactions—excitement, wonder, fear, a sense of loss of control. The closest we have gotten as a society was on October 30, 1938, when CBS Radio systems broadcasted a story that Martians were attacking Earth, starting with a small town in New Jersey. While reports are mixed on whether there was nationwide panic or people simply enjoyed the broadcast of “The War of the Worlds,” many scientists have used this reaction to frame their recommendations for “first contact” protocols. Today’s society is used to getting constant updates via Twitter and other social media, so the post-detection protocols, which were first written in 1989, were revised in 2010, and are currently undergoing another revision.</p><p>As in <em>Contact</em>, the first step would be to verify the signal. Since 1997, scientists have become even more connected globally which fosters collaboration and allows for this sort of testing. In an ideal situation, only after the signal had been verified would the world be alerted to the discovery via a press conference. However, in this increasingly connected world with more “news leaks” this is unlikely to happen. The 2010 International Academy of Astronautics (IAA) post-detection protocol, which is only 2 pages long, now includes informing the public earlier in the process than the original version. If the public were to find out before the signal was fully verified, scientists would manage the public’s expectations by using the Rio Scale, a scale which indicates how likely the signal is to be from an intelligent extraterrestrial civilization.</p><p>Could a discovery of this possibly be contained by one government like the United States attempts to do in Contact? If the signal is discovered by SETI, which is not funded or controlled by a U.S. governmental agency, it is unlikely. Step three in the IAA post-detection protocol is “[a]fter concluding that the discovery appears to be credible evidence of extraterrestrial intelligence, and after informing other parties [researchers or organizations involved in the detection] to this declaration, the discoverer should inform observers throughout the world through the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams of the International Astronomical Union, and should inform the Secretary General of the United Nations in accordance with Article XI of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and Other Bodies.” Yes, astronomers send out “telegrams.” However, today they are digital and are used for all major astronomical discoveries that need further observation. This is widely used for the discovery of new supernovae which are some of the brightest phenomena in the universe but fade very quickly and need quick reactions from observatories around the world to maximize observation time. This step in the IAA protocol also includes notifying eight other international organizations. Step five requires the release of all data necessary to confirm detection to be released to the international scientific community. Unfortunately, there have been no confirmed signals yet and there are Dr. Drumlins in the world who would work closely with politicians so, despite the international community’s best effort, we won’t know until it happens.</p><p>So how would we react as a society? Michael Varnum of Arizona State University investigated just this. In his study, published in the Frontiers of Psychology in 2018, he found that we might react better than science fiction might lead us to believe. Varnum and his team ran several relevant new stories through a language-analysis program and asked it to determine whether the language used in those articles reflected positive or negative emotions. These news articles included stories about the 1967 discovery of pulsars whose regular, repeating signal was first labeled “LGM” for little green men, stories about the “Wow!” signal from 1977 which is the most likely candidate for an extraterrestrial signal but has never been verified, the 1996 “discovery” of fossilized microbes in a Martian meteorite, and more recently articles about the discovery of earth-like exoplanets and the strange behavior of Tabby’s star, which was thought by some to be acting like an “alien megastructure.” These articles generally turned out to include language reflecting more positive attitudes. The second phase of his study was to conduct surveys of approximately 500 people on their anticipated reaction if we discovered (and verified the existence of) microbial life along with asking another 500 people to read, and write down their reactions to, articles about the 1996 “discovery” of microbial life (now known to be incorrect) as well as an article about the creation of synthetic life here on Earth. In both cases, participants used more positive than negative language. However, this study has been criticized for its focus on microbial life. After all, as SETI scientist Seth Shostak points out, microbes are one thing and little grey aliens with an advanced technological society are another. The reality will be much more complicated than people reading a single article and writing down their reactions. People will be influenced by not only how the story is presented, but also by reactions on social media and their friends. This study also didn’t investigate the effect religion will have on people’s reactions, a central theme in <em>Contact</em>.</p><p>If a signal from an intelligent alien civilization is ever detected, it will be a world-changing, paradigm-shifting event. So what are the chances there is life out there that could send such a signal? “There are 400 billion stars out there, just in our galaxy alone. If just one out of a million of those had planets, and just one in a million of those had life, and just one out of a million of those had intelligent life, there would be literally millions of civilizations out there.” Dr. Arroway’s numbers aren’t quite correct and are pessimistic even by the lowest estimates by astronomers. However, even with those numbers, it’s clear that if there wasn’t intelligent life out in the universe, it would be an awful waste of space.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-science-of-sci-fi-cinema-vincent-piturro-mc-farland-153043662.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bd7b952e-3b62-4cf6-a980-15898d62745a</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 15:30:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630686363</ingested><modified>2021-09-03T16:26:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9b5dc4a0-0ccf-11ec-8f37-7998a63bc497" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9b5dc4a0-0ccf-11ec-8f37-7998a63bc497" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warner Bros.

These won&#39;t be your picks if you need a lot of wired networking (the router has two Ethernet ports, the extender has none), but they&#39;re otherwise solid choices if you want fast local wireless with small, unintrusive hardware.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-eero-6-wifi-router-labor-day-sale-144448441.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7aa88a65-63f8-46c6-9502-3c3abf0cb495</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 14:44:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630766691</ingested><modified>2021-09-04T14:44:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4f731c20-0d88-11ec-9fdc-9c3136ceb060" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/4f731c20-0d88-11ec-9fdc-9c3136ceb060" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon Eero 6 WiFi mesh router 3 pack]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Eero 6 WiFi mesh router 3 pack]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nintendo is reportedly adding Game Boy titles to its Switch Online service]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-09-12-nintendo-switch-online-service-launches-september-18.html">Nintendo Switch Online</a> subscription service may give you access to games newer than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-100-classic-games-115540630.html">NES and SNES titles</a> in the near future.

It contained over 40,000 videos featuring 3,000 paid actors who shared their age and gender with the company. Facebook even hired professionals to light their shoot and to label their skin tones, so AI systems can learn what people of different ethnicities look like under various lighting conditions.
