FlexBooker&#39;s typical customers are people who need to be able to quickly schedule appointments with clients, such as doctors, lawyers, dentists, gyms, mechanics, salons, trainers, therapists, so and and so forth.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In Flexbooker&#39;s email to users, it said the infiltrators failed to get &quot;any credit card or other payment card information.&quot; We&#39;re guessing the company didn&#39;t take the stolen partial credit card numbers into account. Before Flexbooker, Uawrongteam previously claimed other data breaches and also traded databases with stolen information from its previous targets.

The company is holding back from revealing absolutely everything (well, most things), but that hasn&#39;t stopped <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/oneplus-10-pro-leak-reveals-all-of-the-phones-key-specs">leaks and rumors </a>of a 6.7-inch display with high refresh rates, and the very latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-announcement-230024192.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It followed up Tuesday evening with a barrage of specs. They include a 120Hz Fluid AMOLED with LTPO screen, which means the phone can adjust its refresh rates to improve battery life. There are no specifics on screen size, but the rumors suggest it’ll be a pretty large 6.7-inch display. OnePlus will include 80W fast charging and 50W wireless charging in its new flagship, which should be suitably speedy when the 5,000mAh battery needs charging.<br><br>The OnePlus 10 Pro will be powered by a Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip, running Android 12 with OnePlus’ OxygenOS tricks and aesthetics. When it comes to cameras, expect 48- and 50-megapixel sensors with an additional 8MP sensor too. Optical zoom capabilities? We don’t know just yet, but the camera array will include dual optical image stabilization, which should help with crisper images, less noise and better performance in low light. That said, the OnePlus 9 Pro’s camera performance was one of the weaker points on an otherwise impressive smartphone. <br><br>Hopefully, the 10 Pro can right that wrong. OnePlus has outlined some of the upgrades it’s making to the Hasselblad-branded camera, including a new RAW+ shooting mode that attempts to combine the editing range of RAW format images with computational photography, which should result in increased dynamic range and noise reduction.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/58a43a40-6f99-11ec-9fa7-5bd1c621cd45" alt="OnePlus 10 Pro sample images" data-uuid="f0e70253-539b-3d7d-b242-77167c16b624"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>The phone also has a new 150-degree ultra-wide camera, with a new fisheye mode. If you’re fearing stretched faces in group shots, don’t worry: there’s a “more traditional” 110-degree FOV that’ll include distortion correction for those outer edges of a shot.&nbsp;</p><p>OnePlus says its new “Billion Color Solution” means photos on the 10 Pro have 25 percent expanded DCI-P3 color gamut covered, and the phone can process 64 times more color than the OnePlus 9 Pro. It says this will remove any hint of color banding from shots.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/588392e0-6f99-11ec-bffd-ce4c25d94bf3" alt="OnePlus 10 Pro sample images" data-uuid="24d9b170-79a7-3ee5-beb1-bbf3b7fbc02f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">OnePlus</div></figure><p>On top of that, each camera on the OnePlus 10 Pro can capture photos in 12-bit RAW, using what Hasselblad calls Natural Color Solution.  The phone also has a new RAW+ format that should allow you to edit to your heart’s content while still benefiting from computational photography assistance. OnePlus has offered a few samples, but it’s something we’ll have a better grasp of when we eventually get to test out the new flagship later this year.&nbsp;</p><p>The big challenge could be balancing price, specs and features so that it offers enough go up against the high-end phones of Apple and Samsung.

Adding functionality to existing products and software is an important part of that, but purpose-built devices play a role as well. &quot;Both OrCam MyEye and OrCam Read have been instrumental devices in ensuring our users have been able to continue their academic, professional and personal pursuits and remain connected to family, friends and society at large,&quot; Shashua said.</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/orcam-smart-glasses-visually-impaired-ces-2022-innovation-award-083054174.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">48f5d156-4403-4e4b-81fd-aaa09992f2b2</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 08:30:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641562164</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T13:29:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fec0d180-6f7c-11ec-9f2f-95e15c2fb7f3" width="2000" height="883" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fec0d180-6f7c-11ec-9f2f-95e15c2fb7f3" width="2000" height="883" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[OrCam]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Orcam's MyEye Pro assistant for the visually impaired wins a CES 2022 Innovation Award]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OrCam's MyEye Pro assistant for the visually impaired wins a CES 2022 Innovation Award]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US regulator rules that Google infringed on Sonos speaker patents]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US International Trade Commission has <a href="https://www.usitc.gov/system/files/secretary/fed_reg_notices/337/337_1191_notice01062022sgl.pdf">agreed</a> with Sonos&#39; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-sonos-sues-google.html">claims</a> that Google had infringed on its speaker and cast patents.

While Google is facing an import ban, a spokesperson said that the tech giant doesn&#39;t expect the ruling to interrupt its ability to import and sell devices.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;While we disagree with today&#39;s decision, we appreciate that the International Trade Commission has approved our modified designs,&quot; the spokesperson told <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/google-violated-sonos-patents"><em>Protocol</em></a>. &quot;We will seek further review and continue to defend ourselves against Sonos&#39; frivolous claims about our partnership and intellectual property.&quot; The commission didn&#39;t challenge those alternative designs in its final decision, which means Google can implement them.&nbsp;</p><p>In fact, the Nest team has recently <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Upcoming-Speaker-Group-changes/ba-p/77811">announced</a> some changes to speaker groups, which it says is &quot;due to a recent legal ruling.&quot; The most notable change is that, going forward, users will no longer be able to adjust the volume of all speakers in a group all at once. They&#39;d have to adjust each speaker individually instead.</p><p>In a statement, Sonos Chief Legal Officer Eddie Lazarus admitted that there&#39;s a possibility that &quot;Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed.&quot; However, he said the tech giant&#39;s products will still &quot;infringe many dozens of Sonos patents&quot; — that is, unless Google pays Sonos royalties for its technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>His whole statement reads:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We appreciate that the ITC has definitively validated the five Sonos patents at issue in this case and ruled unequivocally that Google infringes all five. That is an across the board win that is surpassingly rare in patent cases and underscores the strength of Sonos’s extensive patent portfolio and the hollowness of Google’s denials of copying. These Sonos patents cover Sonos&#39; groundbreaking invention of extremely popular home audio features, including the set up for controlling home audio systems, the synchronization of multiple speakers, the independent volume control of different speakers, and the stereo pairing of speakers.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>There is a possibility that Google will be able to degrade or eliminate product features in a way that circumvents the importation ban that the ITC has imposed. But while Google may sacrifice consumer experience in an attempt to circumvent this importation ban, its products will still infringe many dozens of Sonos patents, its wrongdoing will persist, and the damages owed Sonos will continue to accrue. Alternatively, Google can —as other companies have already done — pay a fair royalty for the technologies it has misappropriated.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-regulator-google-infringed-on-sonos-speaker-patents-062437906.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ee6604f1-b339-44b6-a410-8065f42e68c1</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 06:24:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641536678</ingested><modified>2022-01-07T06:24:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/984a2180-6f73-11ec-8ed5-8bca198c76bc" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/984a2180-6f73-11ec-8ed5-8bca198c76bc" width="1600" height="1066" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Meta sued for alleged role in extremist-linked murder of federal guard]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The surviving sister of Dave Patrick Underwood, a federal security guard who was killed in a drive-by shooting in 2020, has filed <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21174499-underwood-v-meta-complaint">a lawsuit</a> against Meta, the parent organization of Facebook.

The company is testing a new “Tweet Take” feature that allows users to share reaction videos alongside a Quote Tweet.</p><p>With the test, Twitter users can opt to send a “Quote Tweet with reaction” instead of the typical retweet or Quote Tweet. These “Tweet Takes” as the company is calling them can be either a photo or a video, and the original tweet will be embedded as a card overtop.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The concept is similar to a feature in Twitter’s short-lived Fleets feature, which enabled users to share tweets with their own commentary in a full-screen format. Fleets, of course, never really gained traction and the company pulled the feature less than a month after its launch.</p><div id="1484984092e441aeb4236253898a2b46"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Tweet reaction videos can now start on Twitter!<br><br>Testing on iOS: when you tap the Retweet icon, choose “Quote Tweet with reaction” to create and customize your very own Tweet Take –– a reaction video (or photo) with the Tweet embedded. <a href="https://t.co/1E30F8rKYh">pic.twitter.com/1E30F8rKYh</a></p>— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1479185495267721218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>Unlike Fleets, these reaction videos will appear in the main timeline just like any other tweet, though the videos will look noticeably different than the typical retweet.

While Twitter hasn’t necessarily encouraged these types of interaction in the past, the company has been taking steps to build more creator-friendly features so it’s not necessarily surprising to see this kind of experiment.</p><p>Of course, just as Twitter users <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-fleets-harassment-013757824.html">raised concerns</a> about whether Fleets could be used to target people for harassment, tailored reaction videos also feels like the kind of feature that could be ripe for abuse. Quote Tweets are already a major source of dunking and bullying — which Twitter has at times tried<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-08-twitter-will-test-auto-emojis-to-stop-you-dunk-tweeting.html"><ins> to discourage</ins></a> —  so it’s not difficult to imagine that these “Tweet Takes” could also become problematic. It’s also not clear just how big the initial experiment will be — Twitter often previews new ideas and features in early stages, but not all make it past the testing phase.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-tests-quote-tweet-reaction-videos-223147548.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f6833952-748c-42c2-95d9-7ad20efca038</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 22:31:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641508307</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T22:31:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/40198290-6f3b-11ec-bf6e-03317a1a8e0c" width="680" height="383" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/40198290-6f3b-11ec-bf6e-03317a1a8e0c" width="680" height="383" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Twitter]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Twitter is experimenting with reaction videos for Quote Tweets.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Twitter reaction videos]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Home Hub is a tablet for controlling SmartThings devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the products Samsung showed off at its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-ces-2022-supercut-150856924.html">CES 2022 presentation</a> was the Home Hub, an 8.4-inch tablet for controlling all the connected home devices in your household. The company has now <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-home-hub-helps-manage-chores-from-one-central-device">shared</a> more information about it.

Home cooks will find a recipe hub for creating shopping lists and meal plans. Those are just some of the use cases Samsung outlines for the Home Hub. The company says the device’s AI software will anticipate what you need and put that information in front of you exactly when you need it.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung has also pledged to support the upcoming <a href="https://www.engadget.com/matter-smart-home-standard-delayed-164447784.html">Matter standard</a>, which should open the door for the hub to connect to devices from other manufacturers. Based on the photos shared by Samsung, the Home Hub runs Android, suggesting it may also be possible to use it as a standard tablet. The device also comes with two speakers and two microphones, as well as the company’s Bixby assistant. The tablet will come with the charging dock you see pictured in the photos, and you’re free to take it out of that stand.</p><p>At first glance, it’s hard to see the appeal of the Home Hub. After all, it’s essentially a tablet that comes with the company’s SmartThings app preinstalled. You can download that same software on your phone. So it’s not like it’s offering something that isn’t already out there. However, framed another way, it’s a different approach to a smart display. Samsung hasn’t tried to create a device like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-15-review-163035555.html">Echo Show 15</a> that wants to be the center of your home. The focus here is narrow, and that’s something that could appeal to people.</p><p>Samsung will release the Home Hub in Korea sometime in March, with global availability to follow later.

In a complaint spotted by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870120/snap-suing-trademark-word-spectacles-smart-glasses-snapchat"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a>, Snap claims its usage of the term “evokes an incongruity between an 18th-century term for corrective eyewear and Snap’s high-tech 21st-century smart glasses.”</p><p>The complaint stems from an ongoing disagreement between Snap and the USPTO over whether “spectacles” is a term that can be applied to any pair of smart glasses. In an <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149580/ttabvue_87177292_EXA_13.pdf"><ins>opinion</ins></a> the agency’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board published in November, the USPTO said Snap’s use of Spectacles had failed to acquire the “distinctiveness” necessary for a trademark. “Spectacles is so commonly used to describe the nature of the product or competing products, rather than any particular source of the product(s),” the USPTO said at the time. In suing the USPTO, Snap hopes to overturn the appeal board’s decision.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Snap first filed for a Spectacles trademark in 2016, the same year it released the first-generation model. Despite a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-17-snapchat-spectacle-fan-driven-launch.html"><ins>clever marketing campaign</ins></a> involving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-11-10-snapchat-spectacles-snapbot-vending-machine.html"><ins>Minion-like vending machines</ins></a>, the wearable was a bust for the company. At one point, Snap reportedly had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-23-unsold-snapchat-spectacles.html"><ins>thousands of unsold pairs</ins></a> collecting dust in Chinese warehouses. However, even after losing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-02-snap-may-release-two-new-pairs-of-spectacles-soon.html"><ins>$40 million</ins></a> on the first version, it went on to release two new models and recently debuted a pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-spectacles-augmented-reality-180101040.html"><ins>augmented reality Spectacles</ins></a>.</p><p>To that end, Snap claims, thanks to social media marketing, word of mouth and media coverage, consumers have come to associate the word “spectacles” with its brand, a claim the USPTO disputes. In the same November opinion, the agency wrote Spectacles’ “social media accounts have an underwhelming number of followers, and the number of followers is surprisingly small.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snap-sues-us-patent-office-spectacles-trademark-190518221.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">dad25044-f99f-49f3-b735-24e6a19a2583</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 19:05:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641495450</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T18:57:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/abe54ad0-9189-11eb-b3bb-6494623c4d14" width="1600" height="1070" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/abe54ad0-9189-11eb-b3bb-6494623c4d14" width="1600" height="1070" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Snap Spectacles 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Snap Spectacles 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The first edition of the Chevy Silverado EV sold out in 12 minutes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Soon after GM formally revealed the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html"><ins>Chevrolet Silverado EV</ins></a> at CES, it emerged that the $105,000 RST First Edition has already sold out.

VW Group chief Herbert Diess has <a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1479088727045591041">announced</a> that his company will debut the reincarnated microbus on March 9th.

Europe is also more likely to get a self-driving variant, too. Entry models could start with rear wheel drive models that offer up to 200HP, while the range-topper could include AWD and 300HP.

As a standalone product, <em>The Athletic </em>will enable us to offer much more — extensive coverage for fans who seek a deep connection to and understanding of their favorite teams, leagues and players.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The <em>Times </em>has set a goal of reaching 10 million subscribers by 2025 and it&#39;s well on the way. It had 8.3 million subscribers as of September 30th. Along with its digital and print publications, the <em>Times</em> has separate plans for its cooking and games (which includes crosswords) products. It bolstered its offerings in recent years by acquiring <em>Wirecutter</em> and placing the popular product review site behind a paywall.</p><p><em>The Athletic</em> previously said it didn&#39;t expect to turn a profit until next year. It has 1.2 million subscribers, though its growth was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-22/the-athletic-searches-for-a-buyer-and-many-more-subscribers">reportedly slowing</a> as of November. The <em>Times</em> held talks with the company last summer about a deal, according to reports, but it backed out before returning to the negotiating table last month.</p><p><em>The Athletic</em> has a roster of talented, big-name sportswriters, many of whom it poached from publications across North America and the UK by offering competitive salaries. Back in 2017, co-founder Alex Mather <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/sports/the-athletic-newspapers.html?_r=0">told <em>The Times</em></a> (oddly enough) that his company &quot;will wait every local paper out and let them continuously bleed until we are the last ones standing” and &quot;suck them dry of their best talent at every moment.&quot; Mather later apologized for those remarks.</p><p><strong>Update 1/6 6:55PM ET: </strong>Added confirmation of the agreement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-athletic-new-york-times-deal-170515634.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">69d0ab3c-cc49-45f8-8fed-a04f56595e4e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 17:05:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641513476</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T23:58:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/363e4320-6f11-11ec-b7ff-1e6d1a206c52" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/363e4320-6f11-11ec-b7ff-1e6d1a206c52" width="6016" height="4016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[J2R via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[New York City, USA - August 2, 2018: Facade of The New York Times (NYT and NYTimes) headquarters on Eighth Avenue, Manhattan, New York City, USA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The New York Times headquarters in New York City, USA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[David Bowie's later albums have been remixed in 360 Reality Audio]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The late <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-01-11-rip-david-bowie.html">David Bowie&#39;s</a> music is already immersive on many levels, but that&#39;s now reflected in the mixes themselves.  All of Bowie&#39;s post-2000 studio albums (<em>Heathen</em>, <em>Reality</em>, <em>The Next Day</em> and <em>Blackstar</em>) plus a live album (<em>A Reality Tour</em>) have been remixed in Sony&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-360-reality-audio-ces-2021-130027671.html">360 Reality Audio</a> for release on Amazon Music Unlimited, Deezer and Tidal on January 21st. You can also listen to four of the <em>A Reality Tour</em> songs today (January 6th) at 7PM Eastern through <a href="https://square.sony.com/ces2022/360ra/">Sony Square</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKezF4XDLq4">YouTube</a>, and through the <a href="https://music.artistconnection.net/sharedContent?token=shareable_channel_2fDCgNn9CUgsM&amp;studioUuid=faa1b390-624b-4f6a-a703-6e535cb40d90&amp;shareableId=shareable_channel_2fDCgNn9CUgsM&amp;mobileOnly=true&amp;studioId=2&amp;url=https:%2F%2Fapi.demo.artistconnection.net">Artist Connection</a> mobile app afterward.</p><p>Importantly, longtime Bowie producer Tony Visconti was responsible for the mixes. This is as close as you&#39;ll get to a Bowie-approved mix in 2022, in other words, and it&#39;s a fitting tribute for the rock legend&#39;s imminent 75th birthday. You can use any headphones to listen in 360 Reality Audio, although Sony would clearly prefer you use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html">its products</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This won&#39;t satisfy fans who want 360-degree mixes of full classic albums like <em>Hunky Dory</em> or <em>Low</em> (really, the album with &quot;Sound and Vision&quot; didn&#39;t get a rework?). You likewise won&#39;t be thrilled if you prefer services like Apple Music or Spotify. Only a handful of Bowie songs have received the spatial audio treatment to date, though — this is still a treat for enthusiasts eager for some audio bliss.</p><div id="2d17e6cee5d64db8910dab6cce5e5559"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKezF4XDLq4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/david-bowie-360-degree-audio-mix-164016924.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d39cee43-6dde-40b2-9cdd-83e6913ccc0f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:40:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641484706</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T15:58:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/25b85600-6f05-11ec-bfff-bd03170eeedf" width="2200" height="1579" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/25b85600-6f05-11ec-bfff-bd03170eeedf" width="2200" height="1579" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shaun Best / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[David Bowie performs his North American debut of "A Reality Tour" in Montreal, December 13, 2003.

The company has packed more features into the product, such as the ability to monitor body temperature. The graphite-infused foam mattress can cool or heat each side of the bed to maintain each person&#39;s preferred temperature throughout the night. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-sleep-number-climate360.html"><ins>Climate360 mattress</ins></a> also has such a feature. The smart bed can warm your feet to help you drift off too.</p><p>As with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-03-sleep-number-360-smart-bed-auto-adjustments.html"><ins>the current model</ins></a>, there&#39;s a snoring detection function. That can prompt the bed to raise your head to mitigate moderate snoring. In addition, the bed can tilt entirely to open your airway and help you breathe more easily while keeping your spine properly aligned.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the core ideas behind the latest model is that it&#39;s designed to adapt to your changing needs. For instance, it can be raised or lowered to help those who are pregnant, have an injury or are simply getting a little older to get in and out of bed.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4cc923e0-6f06-11ec-adfd-98d4c1c22219" style="height:656;width:1021;" alt="A graphic showing a SleepIQ score as measured by Sleep Number 360 smart bed.

Eventually, it may be able to monitor for signs of insomnia, sleep apnea or cardiac events and alert the sleeper about possible conditions. Software updates should add more features and insights over time.</p><p>The revamped 360 smart bed will be available in 2023. Pricing is expected to start at $1,099.</p><p>Sleep Number also announced some smart furniture that&#39;s designed to complement the bed. Features include mobility aids, individual noise reduction tech, ambient lighting and a built-in charging and storage pocket. The company will start shipping the furniture next year too.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sleep-number-latest-smart-bed-body-temperature-health-conditions-162007609.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">19f92da8-9676-48d7-98cf-5decc4813d81</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:20:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641484156</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T15:49:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Home & Garden]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/45d274b0-6f06-11ec-bbbf-639a8e3f24d7" width="985" height="642" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/45d274b0-6f06-11ec-bbbf-639a8e3f24d7" width="985" height="642" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sleep Number]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sleep Number 360 smart bed]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sleep Number 360 smart bed]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify will show clickable in-app ads when they're mentioned on a podcast]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, Spotify revealed that it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spotify-podcasts-in-app-offers-120000774.html">testing an ad setup</a> that would make promo codes and special URLs during podcast ads a thing of the past. Starting today, those in-app advertisements are starting to roll out. The company says its call-to-action (CTA) cards <a href="https://www.newsroom.spotify.com/2022-01-06/spotify-introduces-call-to-action-cards-for-podcast-ads">will begin showing up</a> on its original and exclusive shows when the corresponding ad or offer is mentioned during an episode.&nbsp;</p><p>The new CTA cards will show up in the Spotify app as soon as the ad plays during a podcast on the player interface as well as on the show and episode pages. If you leave any of those places to do something else — like stream music, for example — the ads will display when you return back to that podcast in those three locations. Essentially, Spotify sees this as a way to not only relieve you have having to remember a promo code or specific URL, but it also argues you&#39;ll be able to interact with ads or brands you&#39;re interested in when you have the time to do so. There&#39;s no doubt a simple tap, if you&#39;re interested in what you&#39;ve just heard, is much more convenient than manually typing in the usual info. Of course, the downside is you&#39;ll now see ads in the app when listening to certain podcasts — even if you&#39;re a paid subscriber.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Spotify doesn&#39;t see this as a potential issue, since even paid users hear ads on podcasts when listening to shows through its app. The advertisements keep podcasts afloat after all, and have turned the medium into a lucrative tool for businesses to promote goods and services. However, some might argue seeing an ad in the app and listening to one during a show are two very different things. Brands will probably be willing to jump on board quickly though since Spotify says the clickable ads have generated twice as many site visits during the early adoption phase than the &quot;traditional&quot; ad reads for companies like Ulta Beauty, Athletic Greens and Squarespace.</p><p>The CTA cards are powered by Spotify&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-08-spotify-podcast-ad-stats-sai.html">Streaming Ad Insertion</a>, a powerful analytics platform for podcast ads that automatically slots in pre-recorded promotional reads in the ideal spot for each listener. This is how the app knows when to begin showing the corresponding card for the ad when you hear it during a show. Of course, Spotify is promoting the CTA method as the first &quot;interactive&quot; podcast ads, and there&#39;s no doubt brands will be excited to have a more visible and, most importantly, clickable way to reach audiences. But it will be interesting to see how listeners respond to visual ads in their streaming app, especially those who pay a monthly premium so they don&#39;t have to hear them on non-podcast content.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spotify-call-to-action-cards-podcast-ads-160009589.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a365edf5-7824-4532-b16c-e22442e72a18</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 16:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641479552</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T14:32:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/13d03ce0-6e61-11ec-bbb7-6bda211abee1" width="1440" height="852" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/13d03ce0-6e61-11ec-bbb7-6bda211abee1" width="1440" height="852" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spotify]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spotify CTA cards]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spotify CTA cards]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max are just $400 at Woot for Amazon Prime members]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">AirPods Max</a> might finally be within reach if you were waiting for them to reach a price threshhold.

As with Janeway, the show being animated keeps the older characters from having that creepy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-20-star-wars-rogue-one-cgi-actor.html"><em>Rogue One Princess Leia look</em></a>, but the audio samples could have used a lot more processing to have them match up. And why a show designed for newcomers needed this much fan service, I don’t know, but at least it’s not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-review.html"><em>Rise of Skywalker</em></a> bad.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c6fbb230-6e6c-11ec-bfee-019e5d750738" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Ella Purnell as Gwyn and Angus Imrie as Zero in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ &#xc2;&#xa9;2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

Janeway has the files, except they’re classified and it’s up to Gwyn and Zero to try to open them up. And, though the initial reveal from them is a bit of a shocker (to be delved into next week), it’s the flashback sequence early in the episode that yielded the juiciest info for now.</p><p>We’re shown the Diviner 17 years earlier, in horrible health and already looking for the <em>USS Protostar</em>. He decides to create a “progeny,” in the hopes of continuing his race, even though it is against the rules. (Whose rules? That’s another unanswered question.) But the interesting reveal here is that the Diviner was already looking for the Protostar 17 years ago, suggesting that this series may not occupy the 2383 time frame we were given in press materials (though never mentioned on-screen).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fe886e00-6e6c-11ec-baa3-fe2810ba79e3" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Jason Mantzoukas as Jankom Pog, Rylee Alazraqui as Rok-Tahk, Brett Gray as Dal, Ella Purnell as Gwyn Kate Mulgrew as Janeway, and Angus Imrie as Zero in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ &#xc2;&#xa9;2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

Even assuming the <em>Protostar</em> is built and launched in a year (which I doubt), <em>Prodigy</em> can’t take place any earlier than 2396, placing it firmly around the time of <em>Picard</em>, which is set in 2399. It’s possible that <em>Prodigy</em> is actually a few years later, however, making it the first Star Trek series set in the 25th century. Or the <em>Protostar</em> traveled through time, complicating things even further.</p><p>But assuming the time period is, in fact, the 25th century, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen the future of the Federation or Starfleet: <em>Discovery</em> is now set in the 32nd century, after all. But being much closer to the time period of earlier shows like <em>The Next Generation</em>, <em>Deep Space Nine</em> and, of course, <em>Voyager</em> makes <em>Prodigy</em> more of a direct continuation of that era. The inclusion of Janeway as a training hologram already gave us a peek as the vaunted status the <em>Voyager </em>crew holds after their Delta Quadrant sojourn, but now the advanced tech seen in episode three “Starstruck” suddenly makes a lot more sense knowing it might be a few years… or decades since <em>Voyager</em>.</p><div id="aa466e8ad1ff497aa1446c179ed31d28"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8316X_cGYs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>With the exception of <em>Picard</em>, the live-action shows have largely stayed away from the immediate future of the <em>TNG-DS9-Voyager</em> era, choosing instead to retread the 23rd century or even jump forward nearly a thousand years. It’s certainly odd given the popularity of those shows, but in leaving it be Paramount+ has left a lot of room for <em>Prodigy</em> and <em>Lower Decks</em> to do something interesting there, experimenting with new genres while still appeasing hard-core fans. This may be the future we’ve been waiting to see on Star Trek.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-episode-six-140026030.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc8d4063-e3f1-4fe2-9ef4-513873d1d6d0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:00:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641419343</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T21:49:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9c21b1e0-6e6c-11ec-b37d-9ec80d433867" width="3000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9c21b1e0-6e6c-11ec-b37d-9ec80d433867" width="3000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nickelodeon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Kate Mulgrew as Janeway, Jason Mantzoukas as Jankom Pog, Angus Imrie as Zero, Ella Purnell as Gwyn and Rylee Alazraqui as Rok-Tahk in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ Â©2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.
