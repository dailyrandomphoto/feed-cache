The controller is $40 off its usual price of $180 on Microsoft&#39;s website right now, and that almost matches its $135 Black Friday pricing last year. Released in 2019, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-09-microsoft-elite-wireless-controller-series-2.html">Xbox Elite Series 2</a> typically sells for $180 and is aimed towards avid gamers.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3sOffB3" id="50e9b6dd3cc34d849243432b69892726" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Microsoft;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 at Microsoft - $140</a><p>Its official page says it was &quot;designed to meet the needs of today&#39;s competitive gamers&quot; and that it &quot;features over 30 new ways to play like a pro.&quot; The controller is highly customizable and ships with a set of six thumbsticks of different shapes and sizes, four paddles, two D-pads, a charging dock, a carrying case and a USB-C cable.

The aim is to &quot;simplify the Web3 user experience that is often bewildering for mainstream users,&quot; Opera EVP Jorgen Arnensen said in statement.&nbsp;</p><p>A key feature is the built-in non-custodial wallet that will support blockchains including Ethereum, Bitcoin, Celo and Nervos from the get-go. It also announced partnerships with Polygon and others. The idea is to let you access your crypto without the need for any extensions, with the option of using third-party wallets as well. You can purchase cryptocurrencies via a fiat to crypto on-ramp, swap crypto directly in-wallet, send and receive it and check your wallet balance. It even has a secure clipboard that ensures other apps can&#39;t data when you copy/paste.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The other primary function is support for Web3, aka blockchain-based decentralized internet, aka the buzzy new thing among crypto enthusiasts (and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jack-dorsey-web3-rant-175156845.html">skeptics</a>). On top of providing extra security via blockchain encryption, it allows users to access things like GameFi &quot;where you can earn as you play your way through all sorts of metaverses,&quot; Opera notes. It also offers a &quot;Crypto Corner&quot; with the latest blockchain news that also &quot;lets you grow your Web3 skills,&quot; according to Opera.&nbsp;</p><p>Opera&#39;s rival Mozilla recently announced it would accept cryptocurrency donations, but was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-stops-accepting-crypto-donations-following-outrage-over-climate-impact-131619769.html">hit by a backlash</a> from users including co-founder Jamie Zawinski over the environmental impact of blockchain. Perhaps anticipating a similar reaction, Opera said it was working toward implementing the more energy-efficient Etherium Layer 2 standard &quot;as quickly as possible.&quot;</p><p>Other companies like Ubisoft jumping on the blockchain train with NFTs and other offerings have been hit by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-de-lists-overwhelmingly-disliked-nft-announcement-video/">similar criticism</a>. However, Opera at least gives its users a choice with multiple browser options, as it also offers its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/opera-chromebook-browser-070050771.html">regular Opera browser</a> and one that&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-11-opera-built-a-browser-just-for-gamers.html">dedicated to gamers</a>.

However, the new study found that the astronauts&#39; bodies destroyed three million red blood cells per second during six month missions. &quot;We thought we knew about space anemia, and we did not,&quot; said Trudel.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A full year after returning to Earth from the ISS, the astronauts&#39; red blood cell levels had not returned to pre-flight levels, according to the study in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01637-7"><em>Nature</em></a>. &quot;If you are on your way to Mars and... can&#39;t keep up&quot; with red blood cell production, &quot;you could be in serious trouble,&quot; said Trudel. That wouldn&#39;t necessarily cause problems in a zero gravity environment, but could become an issue once astronauts arrive on Mars or when they return to Earth.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>[Anemia] is a primary efffect of going to space.</p></blockquote><p>The researchers said that anemia could even be an issue for space tourism, if the potential travelers are at risk for anemia. The study also noted that &quot;current exercise and nutritional countermeasures of modern space travel did not prevent hemolysis and post-flight anemia&quot; with the astronauts tested.&nbsp;</p><p>The study, <a href="https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/1618">first announced in 2016</a>, drew from <a href="https://lsda.jsc.nasa.gov/Experiment/exper/1618">data gathered</a> during Expedition 10 and 11 missions aboard the International Space Station (ISS) in 2004 and 2005. Anemia is defined as a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, a condition that can result in pallor and weariness and affect endurance and strength.</p><p>The study didn&#39;t say how such issues could be directly resolved, but suggested that doctors focus on anemia-related issues when testing candidates. &quot;Medical screening of future astronauts and space tourists might benefit from a preflight profiling of globin gene and modifiers,&quot; according to the study. It also suggested that post-landing monitoring should cover conditions affected by anemia and hemolysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anemia-could-make-space-travel-to-mars-a-challenge-study-finds-103522230.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a917cb7d-b6ac-4881-8d09-bcfe2a7cd104</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 10:35:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642587219</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T10:13:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6b08be0-7907-11ec-bffd-7cf065a4b8a0" width="2048" height="1363" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6b08be0-7907-11ec-bffd-7cf065a4b8a0" width="2048" height="1363" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anemia could make space travel to Mars a challenge, study finds]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anemia could make space travel to Mars a challenge, study finds]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US labor board reconsiders rule that allow gag orders in arbitration agreements]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back in 2020, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/arbitration-clauses-requiring-confidentiality-are-ok-nlrb-says">ruled</a> that companies requiring employees to go into arbitration to settle disputes can add a confidentiality clause to the agreement. Now, the agency is rethinking its decision. The NLRB has <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-invites-briefs-on-mandatory-arbitration-clauses">posted</a> an invitation for the public to submit briefs on whether it should adopt a new legal standard to determine if gag orders in mandatory arbitration agreements violate Section 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act, as well as other legal issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Section 8(a)(1) <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law/interfering-with-employee-rights-section-7-8a1">states</a> that it&#39;s unfair labor practice for employers to &quot;interfere with, restrain or coerce employees&quot; when it comes to exercising their right to self-organization. As <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/labor-board-to-rethink-worker-gag-orders-in-arbitration-pacts"><em>Bloomberg Law</em></a> states, this could lead to arbitration agreements that are more worker-friendly, since the absence of confidentiality clauses means they can talk about their issue publicly and ask help from the appropriate administrative agencies if needed.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Private arbitrations that force workers to keep mum about their issue and the proceedings are a controversial practice. They prevent workers who may be dealing with the same problem to connect, thereby preventing the public and the rest of a company&#39;s workers to see emerging patterns. Companies have landed in hot water for forcing issues like sexual harassment into arbitration in the past, that some have chosen to end the practice. Over 150 Riot Games employees <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-07-riot-games-walk-out-sexism-lawsuits-arbitration.html">staged</a> a walkout after the developer forced the women who filed sexism lawsuits against it into arbitration in 2019. In the same year, Google decided to<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-09-google-walkout-response.html"> end forced arbitrations</a> for sexual harassment cases after a walkout involving 20,000 workers. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airbnb-sexual-harassment-assault-forced-arbitration-guests-hosts-153010488.html">Airbnb</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-ends-forced-arbitration-151427460.html">Activision Blizzard</a> are two other companies that decided to stop forced arbitration for sexual harassment cases.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nlrb-reconsiders-rule-gag-orders-arbitration-agreements-095009215.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e3559cc-36b0-488d-bef9-90a2523b322d</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 09:50:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642585458</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T09:44:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/50281340-78ff-11ec-b7ef-95f69962ace1" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/50281340-78ff-11ec-b7ef-95f69962ace1" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[gesrey via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The document Arbitration Agreement is ready for signing.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The document Arbitration Agreement is ready for signing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon sued by family of employee killed in Illinois tornado warehouse collapse]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is being sued by the family of delivery driver Austin McEwan who died in the Edwardsville, Illinois warehouse <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-tornado-edwardsville-illinois-deaths-climate-220437155.html">struck by a tornado</a> last month, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/amazon-sued-by-family-of-delivery-driver-killed-inside-collapsed-warehouse/"><em>CNET</em></a> has reported.

Amazon said that the dispatcher &quot;didn&#39;t follow the standard safety practice&quot; and should have directed the driver to seek shelter.

The defendant, Kevin George Aziz Riad, was driving a Model S when he ran a red light and crashed into a Honda Civic at a California intersection in 2019.

However, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has been investigating the incident over the past couple of years, recently confirmed that it was switched on at the time of the crash. The NHTSA formally <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html">opened</a> a probe into Tesla&#39;s driver assistance system in August last year following a string of 11 crashes involving parked first responder vehicles that killed 17 people. It&#39;s also investigating other types of crashes with Tesla vehicles, including one <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-investigation-192733573.html">complaint</a> blaming the beta version of the company&#39;s Full Self Driving technology for a collision in California.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As <em>AP</em> notes, Riad is the first to face charges involving a widely used driver assistance technology, but he&#39;s not the very first person using an automated driving system to be charged in the US. In 2020, an Uber backup driver was charged <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uber-autonomous-crash-negligent-homicide-032513753.html">with negligent homicide</a> after the company&#39;s autonomous test vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. According to an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Uber&#39;s technology detected the victim more than five seconds before the crash but wasn&#39;t able to identify her as a pedestrian. The driver could have avoided the crash if she had been paying attention.&nbsp;</p><p>The NHTSA told <em>AP</em> in a statement that &quot;every vehicle requires the human driver to be in control at all times&quot; even if it has a partially automated system. On its <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot">Autopilot</a> page, Tesla says that Autopilot is &quot;intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any moment.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-driver-california-crash-first-to-face-felony-charges-autopilot-073720822.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fcfcc27f-f23e-4e92-9ed4-5d5ea01eb8bd</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 19 Jan 2022 07:37:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642577841</ingested><modified>2022-01-19T07:37:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transport Accident]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-01/d8af3290-4434-11ea-aef6-f9c300a3845f" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-01/d8af3290-4434-11ea-aef6-f9c300a3845f" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[jetcityimage via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Indianapolis - Circa April 2017: Tesla Service Center.

It&#39;s an unambiguous opening salvo in what will likely be a bitter and protracted battle, the playbook for which Lyft and its gig work peers successfully <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/04/tech/california-proposition-22/index.html">tested in California</a> two years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>As the <em>Boston Globe</em><a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/18/metro/lyft-makes-largest-one-time-political-donation-massachusetts-history-fueling-gig-worker-ballot-fight/?camp=bg:brief:rss:feedly&amp;rss_id=feedly_rss_brief&amp;utm_source=feedly&amp;utm_medium=webfeeds">reports</a>, Lyft has thus far contributed the lion&#39;s share of the <a href="https://www.ocpf.us/Filers?q=95481">Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers</a> committee&#39;s $17.2 million war chest, which is intended to fund the forthcoming ballot measure. <a href="https://www.ocpf.us/Filers?q=95481">The rest</a> comes from Uber, DoorDash and Instacart owner Maplebear. The previous record for largest single donation was nearly a third the size: a $5.1 million <a href="https://www.ocpf.us/Filers?q=95471">contribution</a> from General Motors in 2020.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Currently Lyft and Uber are engaged in a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/uber-lyft-and-others-propose-gig-work-measure-in-massachusetts?sref=10lNAhZ9">lawsuit</a>, filed by the Attorney General of Massachusetts, which contends that the companies have been misclassifying their driver workforce as contractors. Leveraging contractor status relieves them of many of the costs and obligations associated with employees — such as minimum wage, healthcare and overtime pay — but true contractors typically control how and when they work, and what they charge for their services. Whether or not ridershare drivers actually have that level of autonomy has become a point of legal contention in several of the <a href="https://www.vox.com/2018/12/5/18127208/new-york-uber-lyft-minimum-wage">states</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/uber-uk-drivers-workers-not-employees/">countries</a> in which these companies operate.</p><p>California thus far has prosecuted its defense of gig-workers-as-employees most vociferously, first through a state Supreme Court <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/business/economy/gig-economy-ruling.html">ruling</a> in 2018, then through AB5, a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/11/california-passes-assembly-bill-5-for-gig-workers.html">successfully-passed bill</a> that (however briefly) enshrined these kinds of drivers as employees. It went into effect on January 1, 2020 and was overturned by ballot measure Proposition 22 that November. Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, Instacart and Postmates dumped a historic $224 million into the proposition — outspending their opposition, which largely consisted of labor unions, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/props-california-2020-election-money/">by more than 10-to-1</a> — the most expensive ballot measure in California history.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Prop 22 was eventually ruled <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/20/technology/prop-22-california-ruling.html">unconstitutional</a>, the strategy has thus far been successful for gig work companies. Legislative changes have been tied up in court, and nowhere in the United States are Lyft or Uber drivers currently entitled to the entire slate of benefits enjoyed by full-time employees.</p><p>In making their case for Prop 22, gig companies essentially employed two lines of attack. The first, against its own workers, was a facile attempt to tie the concept of &quot;flexibility&quot; to contractor status, an utterly false dichotomy perpetuated by the companies themselves. The second was to convince voters in California that the costs associated with a fleet of employee drivers would either force them to scale back service or raise prices.&nbsp;</p><p>After Prop 22 passed, every single company that backed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291580/prop-22-instacart-doordash-uber-lyft-postmates-grubhub-price-hike">raised prices anyway</a>. Uber&#39;s CEO also recently contended on a call with investors that, in the face of potential employee-status regulations in the European Union, Uber can, in fact, afford to &quot;<a href="https://theintercept.com/2022/01/07/uber-drivers-labor-protections-dara-khosrowshahi-european-union/">make any model work</a>&quot; financially. We&#39;ve reached out to Lyft to ask if it&#39;s in a similar position.</p><p>Given this much publicized bait-and-switch, it seems unlikely the Flexibility and Benefits for Massachusetts Drivers committee will be able to successfully argue the same case regarding cost to consumers. Still, the $17.2 million already amassed has paid for, as the <em>Globe</em> reports, a slew of big-name political consultancies who were behind what is currently the most expensive (and likely to soon the be the second-most expensive) <a href="https://www.ocpf.us/Reports/BallotQuestionReports">ballot measure</a> in Massachusetts history, which sought to stymie a right to repair law.</p><p><strong><em>Are you a gig work driver or courier working in Massachusetts?

When Xbox head Phil Spencer took the stage at E3 2018 and announced the acquisition of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-10-microsoft-bought-five-studios-to-fix-its-xbox-game-problem.html">five notable studios</a> – Undead Labs, Playground Games, Ninja Theory, Compulsion Games and The Initiative – the air inside the Microsoft Theater turned electric. It felt like the company was righting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-28-xboxs-lack-of-compelling-games-wont-be-fixed-next-year.html">a wrong in its business plan</a> and finally building an internal roster of exciting games that it could offer exclusively on Xbox platforms. You know, a few friends to keep Master Chief company.</p><p>Today’s announcement that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html">Microsoft is buying Activision Blizzard</a>, the largest third-party publisher in the video game industry, doesn’t feel as harmless. Four years on and numerous acquisitions later, the Activision Blizzard deal feels like an extreme escalation of Microsoft’s plans, and it could mark a turning point in the video game industry as a whole, with negative consequences for both players and developers.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>So far, public reaction to the acquisition <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/s76lrq/log_in_into_your_microsoft_account_to_comment_in/">has been mixed</a>, which makes sense for a few reasons: first, Activision Blizzard&#39;s sheer size is daunting, and this purchase represents more money and industry power than Microsoft&#39;s previous gaming acquisitions combined. Second, Activision Blizzard is currently the subject of multiple investigations into allegations of sexual harassment and gender discrimination at the studio, where CEO Bobby Kotick has been in charge and largely unchecked for the past 30 years. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> is reporting that Kotick is poised to leave the company in a golden parachute once the Microsoft deal goes through.</p><p>This is the first time Microsoft has received a confused response to acquisition news, rather than outright praise, and that&#39;s because this isn&#39;t a standard transaction. It&#39;s the clearest sign yet that we&#39;re in the video game industry&#39;s era of consolidation.</p><p>Back in 2017, Microsoft was badly losing the first-party IP fight to Sony and Nintendo. By the end of that year, Xbox had shut down two of its internal studios, Lionhead and Press Play, it had killed a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-10-cancelling-scalebound-is-a-huge-blow-for-platinumgames.html">hotly anticipated projects</a>, and even with the Xbox Series X right around the corner, there wasn’t much to look forward to in the company’s software reserves. The acquisition announcement at E3 2018 was a sigh of relief for anxious Xbox fans.</p><p>By February 2019, Microsoft had 13 studios and publishing organizations under the banner of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-05-xbox-game-studios-microsoft-rebrand.html">Xbox Game Studios</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/84d94f10-789f-11ec-bbe7-7f995d55bdb4" alt="Xbox acquires Bethesda" data-uuid="a01c7bad-19b2-3927-9c56-38590bf7125f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>And then in September 2020, Microsoft revealed it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-buys-zenimax-bethesda-id-arkane-131006192.html">buying ZeniMax Media</a>, the parent company of Bethesda, id Software, Arkane Studios and Tango Gameworks. The gaming world generally rejoiced, but a few folks also started glancing around, suspicious. These studios were a big deal – the stewards of Fallout, Doom, Dishonored, Wolfenstein, Deathloop, Starfield and Elder Scrolls – and they were being added to Microsoft’s substantial pile of medium-sized companies, more names in a growing list. That alone was cause for pause.</p><p>For most fans, the main question was, what did the acquisition mean for games like <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, which was part of a series that historically hit PlayStation and Xbox platforms alike? Basically, would <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> come to PS4 and PS5?</p><p>Turns out, probably not.</p><p>One year after Microsoft’s purchase of Bethesda, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elder-scrolls-6-xbox-pc-exclusive-game-pass-hint-phil-spencer-172718058.html">Spencer told <em>GQ</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that he believed the Xbox ecosystem was the best place for all of the franchises in the studio’s repertoire, including <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>. He all but confirmed it would be exclusive to Xbox.</p><p>“It’s not about punishing any other platform, like I fundamentally believe all of the platforms can continue to grow,” Spencer told <em>GQ</em>. “But in order to be on Xbox, I want us to be able to bring the full complete package of what we have. And that would be true when I think about <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>. That would be true when I think about any of our franchises.”</p><p><em>Starfield</em>, Bethesda’s sci-fi RPG built for the ninth console generation, will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/starfield-xbox-series-x-s-pc-novemeber-11-2022-164701716.html">definitely be exclusive to Xbox Series X/S and PC</a>, skipping PS5 entirely. Spencer’s comments make it clear that Xbox is eyeing exclusivity for its franchises, and after today’s $69 billion deal goes through, that’s going to include Activision Blizzard games.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/99454670-789f-11ec-9fff-9b31fd887ead" alt="Xbox acquires Activision" data-uuid="6136ecfb-9407-32dd-ba3f-7e8f12926755"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Microsoft</div></figure><p>Activision Blizzard is the largest third-party publisher in gaming, and it’s the owner of massive franchises including Call of Duty, Overwatch, Diablo, World of Warcraft, Hearthstone and Candy Crush. As a third-party studio, Activision Blizzard has been able to negotiate with the main platform holders to get its software on the consoles and devices it wants. This doesn’t always equate to same-day launches or in-game item equity, but generally speaking, this position has helped ensure Activision Blizzard games reach as many players on as many platforms as possible. Exclusivity agreements and distribution deals are the main source of competition in the industry at this point, allowing outside developers to advocate for their games without feeling beholden to any console owner in particular.</p><p>When a platform holder becomes the largest publisher in gaming, it flips the script completely. It jams the script into a shredder, burns the scraps to ash, condenses the ash into stone, and then throws that to the bottom of the Mariana Trench.</p><p>Let’s take Call of Duty, a series with predictable annual installments, for example. Over the years, Activision has shifted allegiances between Microsoft and Sony, offering early access and exclusive game modes to Xbox platforms, then PlayStation, and mixing it up along the way. Among all the backroom talks, bad blood and better offers, it’s always been up to Activision to cut the best deal for Call of Duty, console holders be damned.</p><p>After the acquisition, that negotiation looks entirely different, if it even exists at all. As the owner of Call of Duty, Microsoft can tell Sony to screw off, keeping one of the industry’s biggest franchises exclusive to Xbox platforms.</p><p>This likely won’t happen right away, but it’s certainly a possibility down the line. In his <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/01/18/welcoming-activision-blizzard-to-microsoft-gaming/">blog post</a> about the acquisition, Xbox’s Spencer didn’t address Sony or Nintendo platforms specifically, but he alluded to the possibility of cross-platform support for Activision Blizzard’s franchises.&nbsp;</p><p>“Activision Blizzard games are enjoyed on a variety of platforms and we plan to continue to support those communities moving forward,” he said, without detailing what he meant by “platforms” or “support.” Keep in mind, this was <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elder-scrolls-6-being-xbox-exclusive-is-hard-to-imagine-says-bethesdas-todd-howard/">the messaging</a> around <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> at first, too.</p><p>Microsoft isn’t the only company in the midst of a studio-hoarding spree: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html">Sony</a> picked up its 13th internal studio, Housemarque, in June 2021, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tencent-sumo-acquisition-091425058.html">Tencent</a> is chugging along with ownership of Riot Games, financial stakes in a handful of massive studios, and the purchase of <em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em> developer Sumo Group in July 2021. Even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-04-21-campo-santo-team-joins-valve.html">Valve</a> has scooped up a handful of independent creators in recent years, including the team behind <em>Firewatch</em> and some members of <em>Kerbal Space Program</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/15526d80-be40-11eb-b2ff-f0a12819cc4b" alt="The crowd and stage for Microsoft Xbox at their press event ahead of the E3 gaming convention in Los Angeles on June 9, 2019.

It’s highly likely that there will be more acquisitions by Microsoft, Sony and other major names in gaming, and these deals and subsequent companies will only get bigger with time. With just a few massive studios controlling a huge chunk of the software pipeline, it could instill a sense of homogeneity among new titles, killing innovation as each developer attempts to conform to the corporate environment around them, actively or subconsciously.</p><p>Even with “creative freedom” built into their contracts, the acquired studios will all use the same QA process, funding arrangement, marketing plan, management structure and editing cycle; they’ll have the same bosses and face the same oversight.

According to<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/18/apple-says-antitrust-bills-increase-risk-of-iphone-security-breaches.html"><em><ins>CNBC</ins></em></a>, Apple recently told lawmakers the legislation would make iPhone users less safe.</p><p>“The bills put consumers in harm’s way because of the real risk of privacy and security breaches,” Apple said in a letter seen by <em>CNBC</em>. The company specifically targets app sideloading as a potential threat. One of the provisions of the Open App Markets Act would force platform holders to allow consumers to sideload software and install third-party app stores. “But, if Apple is forced to enable sideloading, millions of Americans will likely suffer malware attacks on their phones that would otherwise have been stopped,” the company states in the letter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On Tuesday, Google, in a <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/the-harmful-consequences-of-congresss-anti-tech-bills/"><ins>post</ins></a> attributed to Kent Walker, the company’s president of global affairs and chief legal officer, advanced a similar argument. “Google is able to protect billions of people around the world from cyberattacks because we bake security and privacy protections into our services,” he said.</p><p>Walker warns the bills could hurt the company’s ability to integrate automated security features in its services. He also claims the bills could hurt the company’s ability and that of its US counterparts to compete with foreign firms by forcing them to obtain approval from “government bureaucrats” whenever they plan to release new features or address existing issues.</p><p>Apple and Google may not like the proposed bills, but they have support from others in the tech ecosystem. Specifically, the Coalition for App Fairness, an organization <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-spotify-and-others-form-alliance-against-app-store-dominance-135026221.html"><ins>Epic and Spotify</ins></a> co-founded to pressure the two companies to change their app store policies, has come out in support of the legislation. “Moving this important legislation forward sends a clear and unambiguous message that monopoly control of the app ecosystem is no longer acceptable,” the group said on Monday.</p><p>The Senate Judiciary Committee will <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/01/14/2022/executive-business-meeting"><ins>discuss both bills on Thursday</ins></a>, at which point they could advance to the floor of the Senate. At that point, the Senate would need to make time to vote on the legislation. That’s something that could take time with all the other issues it needs to consider in the coming weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-google-antitrust-bills-opposition-220354732.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a5f3a37f-1fc9-458c-b0ef-8e39be97901e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 22:03:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642543435</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T22:04:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1a0ed020-78a8-11ec-ad66-48cfb1f49e82" width="5306" height="3537" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1a0ed020-78a8-11ec-ad66-48cfb1f49e82" width="5306" height="3537" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Brooks Kraft via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple CEO Tim Cook testifies at a Senate homeland security and governmental affairs investigations subcommittee hearing on offshore profit shifting and the U.S. tax code, on Capitol Hill in Washington.

The Citizen Lab, a research facility based at the University of Toronto&#39;s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy, said a &quot;simple but devastating flaw&quot; made it easy to bypass encryption systems that are supposed to protect voice audio and file transfers.</p><p>&quot;The worst case scenario is that someone is intercepting all the traffic and recording all the passport details, all the medical details,&quot; research associate Jeffrey Knockel told <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sci-tech/china-s-olympic-app-contains-simple-but-devastating-flaw-1.5744221"><em><ins>CTV</ins></em></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The app is used for health monitoring as part of COVID-19 countermeasures. Other features include messaging, news about the Games and information about logistics. The International Olympic Committee says the local Beijing 2022 workforce is using the app for things like time-keeping and task management too.</p><p>&quot;The IOC has conducted independent third-party assessments on the application from two cyber-security testing organizations,&quot; the IOC told Engadget in a statement. &quot;These reports confirmed that there are no critical vulnerabilities.&quot; The IOC noted that instead of using the mobile app, attendees can access a web-based health monitoring system. It said it has requested the researchers&#39; report &quot;to understand their concerns better.&quot;</p><p>The Citizen Lab notes that health customs forms containing passport information and travel and medical history are also at risk. In addition, the researchers said it was possible to spoof server responses, which could let hackers provide fake instructions to users.</p><p>Along with determining that the app doesn&#39;t encrypt some data transmissions, the team found that the app fails to validate some SSL certificates. In such cases, the app can&#39;t &quot;validate to whom it is sending sensitive, encrypted data.&quot; Although they were only able to create an account on the iOS app, the researchers believe the vulnerabilities exist on the Android version of MY2022 as well.</p><p>The Citizen Lab said it informed the organizing committee for the Games about the issues on December 3rd, and said it had 15 days to respond and 45 days to fix the issues before it published its findings. As of Tuesday, the researchers hadn&#39;t received a reply.</p><p>An updated iOS version of the app that was released on Sunday didn&#39;t solve the problems. According to the researchers, the developers added a feature called “Green Health Code” that asks for more travel and medical history details, which are also vulnerable to the SSL certification issue.</p><p>According to the researchers, the flaws could mean that the app contravenes Apple&#39;s App Store rules and Google’s Unwanted Software Policy. In addition, MY2022 may be violating China&#39;s privacy standards and laws.</p><p>In addition, The Citizen Lab noted that the app includes an option to report “politically sensitive” content. It has a list of 2,442 censorship keywords too, which is said to be inactive at the minute, but includes terms related to topics like Xinjiang, Tibet, Chinese government agencies and other socially sensitive matters.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/olympics-app-my2022-security-privacy-ioc-201935413.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">de2db631-f679-40dc-b87f-40c9a848396e</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 20:19:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642537176</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T20:19:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/20162930-789b-11ec-9de7-ce114879684d" width="5216" height="3477" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/20162930-789b-11ec-9de7-ce114879684d" width="5216" height="3477" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Carlos Garcia Rawlins / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman walks past the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic logo at an installation featuring National Speed Skating Oval, in Beijing, China January 18, 2022.

So HP is launching its new line of rugged Fortis laptops made to stand up to the abuse of students.</p><p>Comprised of a range of laptops and 2-in-1s that start as low as $349, every Fortis notebook comes with an extra level of durability compared to typical notebooks including spill-resistance (up to 11.8 ounces of liquid), reinforced ports and rubber trim to protect against drops and bumps. HP even added a textured surface to make the laptops easier to grip to prevent drops from happening in the first place, while a new metal shield helps protect the laptop’s battery in case the device does take a fall.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To guard against kids who are constantly fidgeting, HP installed a new full-skirted anchored keyboard with keys that are harder to remove.

Connectivity includes one USB-C port for charging and data, two USB-A ports, one HDMI, a combo headphone/microphone jack, and a microSD card reader.</p><p>If you want a slightly smaller Chromebook for education there’s also the HP Fortis 11-inch G9 Q Chromebook, though it won’t be out until June.

What’s more, the only context in which the agency is allowed to carry out such an action is to prevent a terrorist attack involving   Palestinians, Israeli-Arabs or Israeli-Jews. Approval from a senior Shin Bet official or the attorney general’s office is also required. No such exemption exists for the country’s police service. However, according to <em>Calcalist</em>, the software wasn’t directly covered by Israel’s existing laws.</p><p>The report comes a month after <em>Reuters </em>found the Pegasus spyware had been used to target at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-group-spyware-us-state-department-report-183647765.html"><ins>least nine US State Department officials</ins></a>.

As <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/18/twitter-expands-misinformation-reporting-feature-to-more-international-markets/">reports</a>, Twitter has <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1483094056347443202">expanded</a> the &quot;it&#39;s misleading&quot; reporting test to Brazil, Spain and the Philippines — a significant rollout when the option was previously available only in Australia, South Korea and the US. The rollout should continue throughout 2022.</p><p>The tool has been popular, at least. Twitter said it received over 3.7 million reports since the misinformation test went live in August 2021. While site integrity head Yoel Roth said the &quot;vast majority&quot; of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-granular-misinformation-labels-094203660.html">misinformation responses</a> were either automated or proactive, the user reports have already helped the company detect patterns.

Only about 10 percent of them merited action versus 20 to 30 percent for other categories (such as abuse). Some people were prone to merely flagging off-topic tweets as misinformation. The experimentation will give Twitter a chance to &quot;filter and prioritize&quot; reports, according to Roth, and to improve the functionality for non-English languages.</p><p>Along with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-birdwatch-aliases-205849466.html">Birdwatch fact-checking program</a>, the expanded reporting test represents a partial shift toward crowdsourcing as part of Twitter&#39;s efforts to fight falsehoods. We wouldn&#39;t expect Twitter to rely primarily on users given the sheer volume of posts. These initiatives might help Twitter catch misinformation it would otherwise miss, however, and could prevent bogus claims from gaining significant traction.</p><div id="70dfab1557414dce9d4111d142c1c933"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We’re expanding our misinformation reporting pilot to three new countries: Brazil, Spain, and the Philippines.<br><br>Here’s some of what we’ve learned from the more than 3.7 million misinformation reports filed so far, and why we’re continuing with an experimental approach… 🧵 <a href="https://t.co/f099ga8GUN">https://t.co/f099ga8GUN</a></p>— Yoel Roth (@yoyoel) <a href="https://twitter.com/yoyoel/status/1483094056347443202?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 17, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/twitter-misinformation-reporting-expansion-172545885.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b682a0ea-b372-402e-988d-eb7f19cf4f63</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 17:25:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642526746</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T17:26:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1351b9f0-553a-11ec-bb5f-49c12683dec2" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/1351b9f0-553a-11ec-bb5f-49c12683dec2" width="5000" height="3334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2020/10/14: A man wearing a face mask walks past a Twitter logo outside their New York City headquarters.

Netflix has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sel3fjl6uyo">revealed</a><em>The Cuphead Show</em> premieres February 18th, and has offered a trailer to show just what you can expect. At first glance, fans of the difficult-but-loveable side-scroller don&#39;t have much to worry about — Studio MDHR&#39;s signature 1930s art style and characters have successfully made the leap, even if this is still a modern cartoon in many respects.</p><p>The trailer shows Cuphead and his easily-persuaded brother Mugman getting into plenty of trouble by visiting the &quot;Carnevil,&quot; among other hijinks.

The screen has a 16:10 aspect ratio and 400 nits of brightness.

The 10w Tablet has a 30Whr battery and comes with up to 8GB of LPDDR4x RAM and up to 128GB of eMMC storage. Unfortunately, there&#39;s only one USB-C port, but there is a headphone jack, which should help students avoid having to fiddle with the Windows Bluetooth settings. The tablet weighs 573g (1.26 lbs) and 1.1kg (2.42 lbs) with the keyboard.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Lenovo suggests the Snapdragon platform will help deliver responsive performance, dependable WiFi connectivity and an extended battery life.

The system is powered by an AMD Ryzen 5000 U-series processor with on-chip graphics.</p><p>The laptop has a 13.3-inch, Full HD display with 300 nits of brightness. The front-facing 1080p camera has a privacy shutter and you&#39;ll find a 5MP camera on the rear.

Along with an audio jack, there are two USB-C 3.2 ports, one USB-A 3.2 port, a full SD card reader and HDMI 2.0. There&#39;s WiFi 6 and optional 4G LTE support as well.

The all-you-can-play offering now has over 25 million subscribers, a nearly 39 percent jump over the 18 million it had a year earlier. The company didn&#39;t say how many of those customers were using the service on Xbox consoles, Windows PCs or both.</p><p>It&#39;s a significant figure for the service, if not as big as the company would have liked. As <em>Axios</em><a href="https://www.axios.com/xbox-microsoft-subscription-gaming-d047cf43-e9b4-4a33-bd25-1ab2c0ad9346.html">noted</a>, Microsoft missed its Game Pass growth target for the fiscal year that ended in June 2021 — it hoped for a 48 percent year-over-year jump in members, but &#39;only&#39; managed 37 percent. While this was still strong and preceded the release of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-review-campaign-xbox-microsoft-080158610.html"><em>Halo Infinite</em></a>, the company is clearly eager to improve Game Pass&#39; performance.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That, in turn, explains one of the reasons for the Activision Blizzard deal. Microsoft has made clear that it intends to offer Activision Blizzard games through Game Pass. The $10 or more you&#39;re asked to pay each month might become far more compelling if you know you&#39;ll always have the latest Call of Duty or World of Warcraft release on top of Game Pass&#39; other titles. Although the merger might not complete until 2023, it could preserve Game Pass&#39; momentum and help fend off <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-xbox-game-pass-subscription-sparatcus-175650996.html">looming competition from Sony</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-game-pass-25-million-subscribers-151432036.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">59cee312-2f9a-43b1-82c1-364eb80a31be</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:14:32 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642518874</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T15:14:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ca9c8860-786c-11ec-b53b-9a834fa97d0b" width="6108" height="4072" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ca9c8860-786c-11ec-b53b-9a834fa97d0b" width="6108" height="4072" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Christian Petersen via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LOS ANGELES, CA - JUNE 10:  Ashley Speicher, Xbox Game Pass exec, speaks during the Microsoft xBox E3 briefing at the Microsoft Theater on June 10, 2018 in Los Angeles, California.

You may recall back in 2010 Funny Or Die released a trailer for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcNuiri2dV0&amp;ab_channel=FunnyOrDie"><em>Weird: The Al Yankovic Story</em></a>. The clip promised an unflinching look at Yankovic’s life with performances from actors like Aaron Paul, Olvia Wilde and Gary Cole. We’re not about to get that film (sadly), but Roku may just give us the next best thing.</p><div id="7f77a8b1ace84ceb8ba379f86c7c9c41"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcNuiri2dV0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company announced today it’s backing production on <em>WEIRD: The Weird Al Jankovic Story</em>. Instead of Aaron Paul as Yankovic, we get Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe. Eric Appel, best known for his work on <em>Silicon Valley</em> and <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>, co-wrote the film’s script alongside Yankovic and is directing the project. If Appel’s name sounds familiar, it’s because he directed the 2010 trailer for <em>Weird: The Al Yankovic Story</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“I am absolutely thrilled that Daniel Radcliffe will be portraying me in the film,” Yankovic said in a statement. “I have no doubt whatsoever that this is the role future generations will remember him for.” <em>WEIRD: The Weird Al Yankovic Story </em>doesn’t have a release date yet, but production on the film is slated to start next month. Once it’s ready, it will be available to watch for free on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-channel-android-ios-app-launch-130008587.html">The Roku Channel</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/weird-the-weird-al-yankovic-story-roku-channel-150004709.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5def22b8-15b8-4391-bcbd-d0b3f0b6357e</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642443734</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T18:22:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/040431e0-77c1-11ec-baff-b793a46a53e9" width="3500" height="2418" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/040431e0-77c1-11ec-baff-b793a46a53e9" width="3500" height="2418" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mario Anzuoni / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[61st Grammy Awards - Photo Room - Los Angeles, California, U.S., February 10, 2019 - Weird Al Yankovic poses backstage with his Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package award for "Squeeze Box: The Complete Words of 'Weird Al' Yankovic."
