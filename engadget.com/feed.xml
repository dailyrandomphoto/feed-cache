Both run on the same octa-core processor and support 5G connectivity, but the Note 20 Ultra has 12GB of RAM while the standard Note 20 has 8GB. Both also come with the Note series&#39; signature S Pen for drawing, doodling and note-taking and that&#39;s one of the biggest selling point for these devices. The S Pen, while it hasn&#39;t changed much over the past few years, continues to be a solid stylus for Note handsets, with little lag time when writing on the smartphone&#39;s screen and gesture controls with features like Anywhere Actions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the Note series isn&#39;t for everyone, the Note 20 Ultra earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-s-pen-price-140017843.html">score of 86</a> from us and we considered it to be Samsung&#39;s best big phone when it came out last year. It has excellent performance, a fantastic screen, a battery that lasted at least 12 hours on a single charge and a more thoughtful S Pen experience than previous generations. It&#39;s over the top in many ways, but a device like that is easier to justify when you can get it for much less than usual.</p><p>As for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Samsung&#39;s SmartTags" href="https://amzn.to/3tCM16G">Samsung&#39;s SmartTags</a>, they&#39;re the company&#39;s version of Tiles trackers and Apple&#39;s AirTags. You can attach one to things like your keys or slip one into your wallet to keep track of things via your smartphone. The companion app will show the tracker&#39;s last location and you can also use to to force the SmartTag to ring so you can follow the sound to your lost item. SmartTags are water-resistant and, unlike AirTags, they have a keyring hole so you can easily attach them to your things without buying additional accessories.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-note-20-series-is-up-to-400-off-at-amazon-131037187.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">03100fb9-775f-487d-bf0c-e592d577b38e</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 13:10:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631624460</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T13:01:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/b14d2d70-f1f8-11ea-af7f-21fb5d4d4206" width="3000" height="1894" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-09/b14d2d70-f1f8-11ea-af7f-21fb5d4d4206" width="3000" height="1894" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[SteelSeries shrinks its Prime mice for pro gamers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Only a few months after unveiling its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steelseries-prime-lineup-announcement-130022357.html"><ins>Prime mice for pro gamers</ins></a>, SteelSeries has revealed smaller versions of the peripherals.

It started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-sonos-beam-review.html">with the Sonos Beam</a>, a smaller and more affordable version of the flagship Playbar soundbar. And 2020’s new flagship, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-arc-review-dolby-atmos-soundbar-010039560.html">the Sonos Arc</a>, was the company’s first soundbar capable of Dolby Atmos playback.</p><p>Today, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Beam" href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8">Beam</a> is getting a major upgrade. The new, second-generation Beam goes <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:on sale today" href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8">on sale today</a> for $449 and will be available on October 5th. That’s $50 more than before, in line with the other price increases Sonos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-raising-prices-september-12-174153206.html">announced last week</a>. The good news is that the new Beam is more capable than its predecessor in a number of ways. We’ll have to review it before we can really say if it’s worth the extra $50, but there are a number of notable new features here.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new Beam looks nearly identical to its predecessor, aside from a new perforated polycarbonate grille instead of the cloth front found on the original. It also has the same speaker components inside: a center tweeter, four woofers, and three passive bass radiators. What’s different is that the new processor inside the Beam is 40 percent faster, which opens up a lot of new audio formats.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/19eb6d30-14dd-11ec-bac3-6ed10307fd94" alt="Sonos Beam (gen 2)" data-uuid="a6ea4fed-59ef-32d4-8695-c67c838ae170"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>Most notably, the gen-two Beam supports Dolby Atmos, for movies, TV and music (the latter in a limited fashion, for now). Scott Fink, a product manager at Sonos who worked on the new Beam, says that the horsepower from the new CPU let the company increase the speaker arrays — not the specific speaker components, but, as Fink explains, “the set of software that coordinates the playback and interaction of all the speakers together in the soundbar.” The new Beam has five arrays, up from the three in the older model, and Fink said that the extras are dedicated to surround sound and height info.</p><p>All told, the Beam supports the same home theater audio formats <a href="https://support.sonos.com/s/article/4945?language=en_US">as the Arc</a> (including Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, Multichannel PCM and more), which costs twice as much as the Beam. In addition to the increased processing power, the new Beam has HDMI eARC to facilitate these new formats. Sonos says the speaker should have improved dialog clarity thanks to the additional audio processing power, something that should make the currently-available speech enhancement feature work better than before.</p><p>The hardware also supports additional music formats, as well. The Beam (as well as the Arc) will soon support the Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos formats from Amazon Music. Some Sonos speakers have worked with a handful of HD music services for a while now, but this is the first time that a 3D music format will work with the company’s products. I asked if there were any plans to support Dolby Atmos on Apple Music, and unsurprisingly the company wasn’t willing to say yet. But, there shouldn’t be any technical reason, it’s just a matter of Sonos and Apple working together to get more Apple Music formats supported.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5e258d50-14dd-11ec-bbbb-043e27acfed2" alt="Sonos Beam (gen 2)" data-uuid="25c287ff-9baa-30f6-a9a4-eb241cd92d3b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sonos</div></figure><p>As with other Sonos products, the new Beam connects to the company’s other speakers for multi-room playback; you can also use other Sonos speakers as surrounds. You can tune the speaker to your room to improve the sound using Trueplay, assuming you have an iOS device. The Beam also has far-field microphones so it can receive voice commands through either Alexa or the Google Assistant, but that’s not required (there’s a mic mute button right on top of the Beam, too). Like some other recent Sonos speakers, the new Beam has NFC to make setup even easier — playing your phone running the Sonos app near it will automatically connect it to your WiFi network.</p><p>Based on what Sonos has said so far, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:new Beam" href="https://fave.co/2Q8qqn8">new Beam</a> is probably not a crucial upgrade for most, unless you’ve been itching to get Dolby Atmos into your setup without spending a ton of money. But given that the Beam is already the best-selling compact soundbar (according to NPD data), these upgrades should help it keep its lead over the competition — even with that $50 price hike.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sonos-beam-2nd-generation-home-theater-soundbar-130053922.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bda2bc31-c6bf-4504-85ed-6072cc1c14e1</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 13:00:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631625401</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T13:16:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e1d2ec20-14dc-11ec-bdcb-3f9ac410273d" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/e1d2ec20-14dc-11ec-bdcb-3f9ac410273d" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sonos]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sonos Beam (gen 2)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sonos Beam (gen 2)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[LG's 325-inch Direct View LED TV is an answer to Samsung's The Wall]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t have to stick to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-microled-tv-presale-korea-043149097.html">Samsung&#39;s The Wall</a> if you insist on a gigantic TV for your equally sprawling mansion. LG has <a href="https://www.lg.com/us/business/direct-view-led-home-cinema-display">introduced</a> a Direct View LED (DVLED) Extreme Home Cinema line aimed squarely at &quot;super-luxury&quot; homes. It relies on the same basic concept of using millions of LED diodes (anywhere from 2 million to 33 million) to form a complete picture in customized shapes, but can scale to sizes that might even make Samsung blush — you can choose anything from a &#39;small&#39; 81 inches to a room-dominating 325-inch setup.</p><p>You&#39;ll need to stick to a conventional 16:9 ratio if you want those extremes, but you can also opt for &quot;UltraStretch&quot; 32:9 arrangements if you want to watch multiple video sources at the same time (say, live sports featuring the teams you own). You&#39;ll have to spring for those 33 million diodes if you want an 8K picture, but you can make do with 4K or even 2K (both in single or dual configurations) if you&#39;re not quite so determined to impress your guests. A WebOS controller box provides smart TV functions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LG is taking orders for these DVLED home sets now, but it won&#39;t shock you to hear that LG isn&#39;t listing prices when each system is a custom order. It&#39;s safe to say the costs won&#39;t be trivial. LG estimates the  installation, warranty and support (including twice-a-year &quot;health checks&quot;) are worth $30,000 — the actual set is bound to be much more.

The XM3 have excellent sound quality with booming bass that isn&#39;t overpowering, bright highs and overall solid performance across a bunch of genres.

The buds themselves are bulkier than most and their charging case is, admittedly, huge. Sony tried to fix this with the XM4, and it succeeded in doing so more with the charging case than with the earbuds. The latest buds remain on the larger side, although they have a more modern design, and the wireless charging case 40 percent smaller than that of the XM3. Sony also improved upon the ANC in the XM4 and increased the battery life to eight hours with ANC turned on. Those changes were enough to push the XM4 to the top spot on our favorites list, but you&#39;ll pay $280 to get all of that new tech.</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Best Buy&#39;s flash sale" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/mgGz2y">Best Buy&#39;s flash sale</a> has a few more gems to consider. <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Lenovo&#39;s original Smart Clock" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/ZdNVQg">Lenovo&#39;s original Smart Clock</a> is on sale for $35, or $45 off its normal price.

With the release, it has now filled in the blanks for key specifications <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-confirms-development-eos-r3-mirrorless-camera-082035304.html">not yet revealed</a> in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r3-race-car-tracking-125059799.html">earlier teases</a>, like resolution, ISO range and video capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>The EOS R3 was never likely to be a high-resolution camera as some folks hoped, but the 24.1-megapixel, back-side illuminated (BSI), stacked sensor (a first for Canon) is a significant upgrade over the 1DX Mark III&#39;s 20-megapixel sensor. Canon says it &quot;achieves resolution performance exceeding that of the 30.1-megapixel EOS 5D Mark IV,&quot; despite having a lower pixel count.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the BSI/stacked sensor and latest DIGIC X image processor, the R3 can shoot at 30 fps in electronic shutter mode (down to 1/64,000th of a second) or 12 fps with the mechanical shutter, with full AF tracking and auto-exposure. Better still, it offers blackout-free shooting in electronic mode and the high readout speeds deliver minimal rolling shutter distortion — making it feasible to shoot sports or action with the electronic shutter.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/3b7c97c0-146b-11ec-8f7e-91d97a29c50a" alt="Canon&#39;s flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000" data-uuid="bf695619-0ab5-32bb-b04e-1d3309f7784c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>The EOS R3 is Canon&#39;s first EOS model to support flash photography in electronic shutter mode. That allows for blackout-free flash shooting at up to 15 fps (at 1/180th of a second), which would probably look pretty wild in person. It also offers a silent shutter mode that turns off the artificial shutter and AF acquisition sounds.&nbsp;</p><p>The EOS R3 has a number of new autofocus features, too. The flashiest is Eye Control AF that locks onto focus wherever your eye is looking when you half-press the shutter button. It can be used in combination with flexible zone and subject AF tracking, so it&#39;s &quot;possible to quickly shift the target between multiple subjects,&quot; Canon says. It notes that the feature can be calibrated differently if you have glasses or contacts, and that &quot;some glasses/contacts may prevent calibration.&quot;</p><p>Faster calculation speeds give the EOS R3 some new autofocus powers, too. The Dual Pixel AF system can now track in spot, single-point and flexible zone AF, and in lower light (-7.5 EV) than any other model. It can also acquire a subject just by getting close to it, so it will track an animal or human&#39;s head, face or eye if you place the AF point near their body, for example.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5bc005d0-146b-11ec-bbdd-8988aaa62391" alt="Canon&#39;s flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000" data-uuid="5f5e7fc4-57b0-3a83-8b18-5ba0f56fb326"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>On top of body, face, head and eye detection for humans, the R3 offers a new &quot;Vehicle Priority&quot; tracking system for open cockpit, GT and rally cars, along with on-road and off-road motorcycles. If the AI detects a helmet (on a motorcycle or open cockpit car), it will automatically lock onto that.</p><p>The new sensor delivers improved low-light performance too, with the EOS R3 having a normal range of ISO 100-102,400 for stills (expandable to ISO 50-204,800). Canon also promises improved automatic and manual white balance via new AI skills.</p><p>The 5-axis in-body stabilizer is the the same as the excellent system on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-eos-r5-review-150038797.html">EOS R5</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-r6-review-almost-perfect-140051632.html">R6</a>. As with those models, it delivers up to 8 stops of stabilization with compatible lenses, down to a minimum of 6 stops (still beating most other brands) with other lenses. It also comes with dual card slots, supporting SD and CFexpress type B cards.</p><p>The R3 comes with a new 5.76 million dot, 120 FPS OLED electronic viewfinder (EVF) developed by Canon. This is a key feature for the sports photographers who might buy it, as many haven&#39;t switched to mirrorless because they prefer an optical viewfinder. Canon said it provides a level of clarity and field of view similar to an optical viewfinder &quot;thanks to the HDR technology and high brightness performance.&quot; Like the R6 and R5, it also offers a fully-articulating, 4.15 million dot flip-out touchscreen — ideal for video shooters.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/81d3cb80-146b-11ec-9f3a-21ded624b0d7" alt="Canon&#39;s flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000" data-uuid="f7afac2a-9202-3d98-b882-c3137bc564e6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>In fact, the R3 is also a highly competent video camera, too. While it can&#39;t shoot 8K video like the R5, it can capture RAW 12-bit 6K widescreen (6,000 x 3,164) video at up to 60 fps to a CFexpress B card, besting Panasonic&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-panasonic-s1h-review.html">video-centric S1H</a>. Canon has yet to say if 6K RAW over HDMI will be supported, however.</p><p>It also offers 4K recording at up to 120 fps, albeit in a cropped 1:1 pixel mode to a CFexpress card. Still, you can capture 4K 60p or 30p video using the full width of the sensor, which should make for some crisp video. Again, for the best quality, you&#39;ll need a fast SD UHS II or CFexpress card. 10-bit 4:2:2 video will be available for all 4K modes in either HDR PQ or Canon Log 3 modes, with both All-I and long-GOP file options.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual with Canon cameras, the Dual Pixel autofocus should be a strong point for video, as it can lock in to a subject quickly without any hunting. As it stands now, however, the Eye Tracking feature only works for photography, not video. Still, the extra tracking features should make it extra powerful in terms of video autofocus, but we&#39;ll need to test the R3 to verify that. As you&#39;d well expect, it has microphone, headphone and HDMI ports — though the latter is a micro and not a full-sized HDMI connector, unfortunately.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/a3a92430-146b-11ec-b8fd-2bea7b37f951" alt="Canon&#39;s flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000" data-uuid="845db65c-573d-39ed-aa6d-3d24bae3f10b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>What about heating, the bugbear of the R5? Again, Canon has significantly improved the R3 here. It now offers two temperature options for auto power off: standard and high. The latter will let you shoot 6K RAW or 4K All-I at 60 fps for 60 minutes or more, though the camera might get a bit hot to the touch. 4K 120p All-I is limited to 12 minutes in either mode. Canon promises that you&#39;ll be ready to shoot again after just five minutes, though shooting times afterward will be limited in 6K 60p and 4K 120p modes. Normal 4K 30fps shooting (down-sampled or otherwise) has no heat limitations.&nbsp;</p><p>Other features include network streaming functions and wired or wireless transfer to a 5G or LTE smartphone. It uses the 1DX Mark III&#39;s LP-E19 battery that delivers 440 shots with the electronic viewfinder and comes with a new electronic hot shoe that supports more accessories, including a smartphone link adapter. Finally, the EOS R1 offers dust and drip resistance equal to the EOS-1DX series DSLRs, and weighs in at 1015 grams (2.24 pounds) including a memory card and battery.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/777df650-146c-11ec-bf0b-f66fe072cc79" alt="Canon&#39;s flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000" data-uuid="ed241d80-ab8d-3628-8e1b-155dc7752734"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Canon</div></figure><p>Along with the EOS R3, Canon unveiled two new lenses, the compact RF16mm F/2.8 STM ultra wide angle model priced at $300 (left) and the RF100-400mm f/5.6-8 IS USM model priced at $650. Both of those should be decent budget full-frame RF-mount options if you&#39;re looking for an ultra wide-angle or tele zoom lens.&nbsp;</p><p>With the EOS R3, Canon has built a supercharged flagship that should appeal to both the serious photographers and videographers who have the bucks to afford one. It arrives at the end of November for $6,000 (body only).&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/canons-24-megapixel-eos-r-3-can-shoot-raw-photos-at-30-fps-100003365.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8277a5e4-d651-4342-831c-872dc61fca6f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 10:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631614278</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T10:11:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1b86fb90-146b-11ec-b5df-6c319d40b3a0" width="1920" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/1b86fb90-146b-11ec-b5df-6c319d40b3a0" width="1920" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Canon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Canon's flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Canon's flagship 24-megapixel EOS R3 arrives in November for $6,000]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's palm-reading tech is heading to sports stadiums and music venues]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has been using its palm-scanning technology to allow customers to pay for purchases at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-just-walk-out-tech-comes-to-two-whole-foods-stores-101036042.html">Whole Foods</a> and its own cashierless stores.

The device won&#39;t only be capable of taking photos, but also of displaying messages and notifications, making calls, providing navigation and translating text right in real time in front of your eyes. Like Facebook, Xiaomi is also putting emphasis on the device&#39;s lightness despite its features. At 51 grams, though, it&#39;s a bit heavier than the social network&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ray-ban-stories-smart-glasses-ar-160006477.html">Ray-Ban Stories</a>. In addition, the glasses also has an indicator light that shows when the 5-megapixel camera is in use.</p><div id="3e6dd2c0ff254c74aa8033a15b7e647d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I9bnmES7O74?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Xiaomi&#39;s Smart Glasses are powered by a quad-core ARM processor and run on Android. They also use MicroLED imaging technology, which is known for having a higher brightness and longer lifespan than OLED. The company says the technology has a simpler structure that enabled it to create a compact display with individual pixels sized at 4μm. You won&#39;t be able to view the images you take in color, though — Xiaomi says it opted to use a monochrome display solution &quot;to allow sufficient light to pass through complicated optical structures.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company explains:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The grating structure etched onto the inner surface of the lens allows light to be refracted in a unique way, directing it safely into the human eye. The refraction process involves bouncing light beams countless times, allowing the human eye to see a complete image, and greatly increasing usability while wearing. All this is done inside a single lens, instead of using complicated multiples lens systems, mirrors, or half mirrors as some other products do.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Its smart glasses won&#39;t be just a second screen for your phone, according to Xiaomi. It&#39;s independently capable of many things, such as selecting the most important notifications to show you, including smart home alarms and messages from important contacts. The device&#39;s navigation capability can display maps and directions in front of your eyes. It can also show you the number of whoever&#39;s currently calling your phone, and you can take the call using the smart glasses&#39; built in mic and speakers.</p><p>That mic will be able to pick up speech, as well, which Xiaomi&#39;s proprietary translating algorithm can translate in real time. The glasses&#39; translation feature also works&#39; on written text and text on photos captures through its camera. Unfortunately, the company has yet to announce a price or a launch date for the glasses, but we&#39;ll keep you updated when it does.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-launches-its-own-smart-glasses-031328346.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c13efd82-7a4a-4d73-b9fb-51709edf4b07</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 03:13:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631615797</ingested><modified>2021-09-14T10:36:50+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/80e538d0-1547-11ec-b67f-7a8668494500" width="5120" height="2880" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/80e538d0-1547-11ec-b67f-7a8668494500" width="5120" height="2880" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Xiaomi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Xiaomi Smart Glasses]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Xiaomi Smart Glasses]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung’s One UI 4 beta opens to Galaxy S21 owners on September 14th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After an <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-one-ui-4-delayed-3019026/">eleventh hour delay late last week</a>, Samsung One UI 4 is <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__smsng.news_3nsjCz3&amp;d=DwMF-g&amp;c=sWW_bEwW_mLyN3Kx2v57Q8e-CRbmiT9yOhqES_g_wVY&amp;r=iUeMNOIuPBRnHjfl_fszGq526fhBaDKweMfHkI-i9iM&amp;m=T9CDCCu2Zt8YPnKaowJFYrgz6KHN06SjoonGz3bNmTk&amp;s=7Jzb9juOyM5PBScfoeOzouoIETeNn3Qwz6xvrJJQbHQ&amp;e=">ready for public beta testing</a>.

The company says that existing research shows that “social media is not a primary driver of harmful polarization.” But in their report, NYU’s researchers write that “research focused more narrowly on the years since 2016 suggests that widespread use of the major platforms has exacerbated partisan hatred.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>To make their case, the authors highlight numerous studies examining the links between polarization and social media. They also interviewed dozens of researchers, and at least one Facebook executive, Yann Le Cun, Facebook’s top AI scientist.</p><p>While the report is careful to point out that social media is not the &quot;original cause&quot; of polarization, the authors say that Facebook and others have “intensified” it. They also note that Facebook’s own attempts to reduce divisiveness, such as de-emphasizing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-content-news-feed-mark-zuckerberg-232846266.html"><ins>political content</ins></a> in News Feed, show the company is well aware of its role. “The introspection on polarization probably would be more productive if the company’s top executives were not publicly casting doubt on whether there is any connection between social media and political divisiveness,” the report says.</p><p>“Research shows that social media is not a primary driver of harmful polarization, but we want to help find solutions to address it,” a Facebook spokesperson said in a statement. “That is why we continually and proactively detect and remove content (like hate speech) that violates our Community Standards and we work to stop the spread of misinformation. We reduce the reach of content from Pages and Groups that repeatedly violate our policies, and connect people with trusted, credible sources for information about issues such as elections, the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.”</p><p>The report also raises the issue that these problems are difficult to address “because the companies refuse to disclose how their platforms work.” Among the researchers recommendations is that Congress force “Facebook and Google/YouTube, to share data on how algorithms rank, recommend, and remove content.” Platforms releasing the data, and independent researchers who study it, should be legally protected as part of that work, they write.</p><p>Additionally, Congress should “empower the Federal Trade Commission to draft and enforce an industry code of conduct,” and “provide research funding” for alternative business models for social media platforms. The researchers also raise several changes that Facebook and other platforms could implement directly, including adjusting their internal algorithms to further de-emphasize polarizing content, and make these changes more transparent to the public. The platforms should also “double the number of human content moderators” and make them all full employees, in order to make decisions more consistent.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/social-media-political-polarization-nyu-report-223945859.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">11390a81-445d-4c47-bb61-eb8622d3e148</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 22:39:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631572785</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T22:39:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/be6ce8b0-14d9-11ec-bfaf-2f7745f633a8" width="4545" height="3030" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/be6ce8b0-14d9-11ec-bfaf-2f7745f633a8" width="4545" height="3030" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[POLAND - 2020/12/30: In this photo illustration a Facebook logo seen displayed on a smartphone with fireworks in the background.

The company has several models under its belt, and the current lineup spans from <a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/cx-true-wireless">basic and affordable</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-15-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-review.html">premium and pricey</a>. Today, Sennheiser is introducing its latest earbuds with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:CX Plus True Wireless" href="https://fave.co/3EdgBbY">CX Plus True Wireless</a>. This newest entry offers active noise cancellation (ANC), ambient sound and the ability to customize both the on-board controls and the EQ. It also costs less than the company&#39;s previous ANC model, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-19-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review.html">Momentum True Wireless 2</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The CX Plus has a similar design to the CX and CX 400BT true wireless earbuds Sennheiser currently sells. The outer touch panel is a rounded rectangle compared to the circular exterior of the Momentum buds. On-board touch controls give you everything you need to play music, take calls and use a voice assistant without reaching for your phone. As the name implies, the CX Plus has features that aren&#39;t on the CX True Wireless. That includes a Smart Pause feature, which is basically just automatic pausing when you remove an earbud from your ear, but Sennheiser has given it a fancy name. Smart Pause was previously reserved for the pricier Momentum True Wireless 2.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/bd26e810-14c1-11ec-bfdf-38c806c18b7b" alt="Sennheiser CX Plus True Wireless" data-uuid="4bf3fe9f-45c6-31eb-bf6f-2b26587dbe64"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sennheiser</div></figure><p>Another key addition for the CX Plus is ANC. The two preceding CX models only offer passive noise isolation. The CX Plus also offers ambient sound mode, or as Sennheiser calls it, Transparent Hearing. That feature was also not available on the CX series earbuds before now. Both active noise cancellation and Transparent Hearing were only on the Momentum True Wireless 2. The company&#39;s Bass Boost preset from some previous models and the IPX4 splash-proof rating from the CX True Wireless both made the leap to the CX Plus.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of sound quality, Sennheiser says the CX Plus offers &quot;audiophile technology&quot; in &quot;everyday&quot; earbuds thanks to its TrueResponse transducer. The acoustic setup was built for much more expensive earphones and designed for &quot;high-fidelity stereo sound&quot; that offers &quot;deep basses, natural mids and clear, detailed treble.&quot; The company has a solid track record when it comes to sound, but we&#39;ll still need to check those claims ourselves to make sure they hold up this time around.

The cross check program meant that if one of these accounts broke its rules, the violation was sent to a separate team so that it could be reviewed by Facebook employees, rather than its non-employee moderators who typically review rule-breaking content.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook had previously disclosed the existence <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2018/07/working-to-keep-facebook-safe/"><ins>of cross check</ins></a>, which had also been reported on by other outlets. But <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> report revealed that “most of the content flagged by the XCheck system faced no subsequent review.” This effectively allowed celebrities, politicians and other high profile users to break rules without consequences.</p><p>In one incident described in the report, Brazilian soccer star Neymar posted nude photos of a woman who had accused him of sexual assault. Such a post is a violation of Facebook’s rule around non-consensual nudity, and rule breakers are typically banned from the platform. But the cross check system “blocked Facebook’s moderators from removing the video,” and the post was viewed nearly 60 million times before it was eventually removed. His account faced no other consequences.</p><p>Last year alone, the cross check system enabled rule-breaking content to be viewed more than 16 billion times before being removed, according to internal Facebook documents cited by <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>. The report also says Facebook ‘misled’ its Oversight Board, which pressed the company on its cross check system <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html"><ins>in June</ins></a> when weighing in on how the company should handle Donald Trump’s “indefinite suspension.” The company told the board at the time that the system only affected “a small number” of its decisions and that it was “not feasible” to share more data.</p><p>“The Oversight Board has expressed on multiple occasions its concern about the lack of transparency in Facebook’s content moderation processes, especially relating to the company’s inconsistent management of high-profile accounts,” the Oversight Board said in a statement shared <a href="https://twitter.com/OversightBoard/status/1437434013153640455"><ins>on Twitter</ins></a>. “The Board has repeatedly made recommendations that Facebook be far more transparent in general, including about its management of high-profile accounts, while ensuring that its policies treat all users fairly.”</p><p>Facebook told <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> that its reporting was based on “outdated information” and that the company has been trying to improve the cross check system. “In the end, at the center of this story is Facebook&#39;s own analysis that we need to improve the program,” Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone <a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1437463427103002624"><ins>wrote</ins></a> in a statement. “We know our enforcement is not perfect and there are tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.”</p><p>The revelations could prompt new investigations into Facebook’s content moderation policies. Some information related to cross check has been “turned over to the Securities and Exchange Commission and to Congress by a person seeking federal whistleblower protection,” according to <em>The Wall Street Journa</em>l.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vip-cross-check-xcheck-181720267.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cf0a5f45-64c4-46bc-b477-04346c7df26a</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 18:17:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631557040</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T18:17:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-06/692e4680-a42f-11ea-bb5c-a249495bbdb1" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-06/692e4680-a42f-11ea-bb5c-a249495bbdb1" width="5568" height="3712" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JIM WATSON via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before a joint hearing of the US Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee and Senate Judiciary Committee on Capitol Hill, April 10, 2018 in Washington, DC.

There are almost too many enhancements to count, but some of the more notable ones have the potential to change how you use the service.</p><p>The first of those is an expansion of Zoom&#39;s automated closed captioning system. At the start of the year, Zoom&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-automatic-closed-captions-all-users-fall-081631869.html">announced</a>&nbsp;it was making the feature available to all of its users by the fall of 2021. Now, the company plans to make it work in a total of 30 languages. It’s also adding live translation support for 12 languages. Both expansions will occur over the next year and come after the company&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-kites-real-time-machine-translation-184824115.html">bought a startup</a>&nbsp;that specializes in real-time translation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zoom is also working on an expanded&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-whiteboard/">Whiteboard experience</a>&nbsp;that will make the feature available on the web and outside of meetings and calls. To that end, you’ll find a separate Whiteboard tab once the experience rolls out in beta later this year. Then, sometime next year, Zoom plans to work with Facebook to bring its video conferencing software and Whiteboard feature to the company’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">Horizon Workrooms</a>&nbsp;to allow you to access them both in virtual reality.</p><p>Zoom is also working on several smaller but still notable features. For instance, support for end-to-end encryption is coming to&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.zoom.us/e2ee-byok-verified-identity">Zoom Phone</a>, which will allow you to keep phone calls you make over Zoom secure.

All three have to be near each other, as well. After they&#39;ve logged into their profile on the Tempo Studio and download the app for the Watch, they only need to follow the steps laid out on their iPhone.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-tempo-ai-powered-home-gym-integration-173057957.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7c62851-75a2-42f8-ac34-8afc99842c46</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 17:30:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631355014</ingested><modified>2021-09-11T10:10:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/aaa45cd0-12e2-11ec-a5de-3b99156dc993" width="1270" height="715" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/aaa45cd0-12e2-11ec-a5de-3b99156dc993" width="1270" height="715" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Tempo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tempo]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tempo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sony permanently shuts down LittleBigPlanet's PS3 and Vita servers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sony has permanently shut down the online services for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/littlebigplanet"><ins>LittleBigPlanet</ins></a> games on PlayStation 3 and PS Vita after &quot;extended downtime.&quot; As such, online multiplayer and community levels are no longer available for <em>LittleBigPlanet, LittleBigPlanet 2, </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-11-18-littlebigplanet-3-review-knitting-lessons.html"><em><ins>LittleBigPlanet 3</ins></em></a> (on PS3) and <em>LittleBigPlanet PS Vita</em>.

The PS3 games were on the same servers, so if an issue affected one game, it impacted all of them.</p><p>There is a silver lining to this development, though. The developers have updated the PS4 version of <em>LittleBigPlanet 3</em> and that game&#39;s servers are back online. Players once again have access to more than 10 million community levels, including all of the ones users created on the three PS3 games, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-13-without-warning-sony-shuts-down-online-for-older-littlebigplanet-games-to-protect-the-littlebigplanet-community"><em><ins>Eurogamer</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>noted.</p><p>The unbelievably charming platformers have been a staple of PlayStation since MediaMolecule released the original <em>LittleBigPlanet </em>in 2008. It&#39;s a shame to see the community levels disappear from the Vita game and those who&#39;ve been clinging onto the PS3 versions lose access to online services. Still, it&#39;s good to see all of the community levels live on elsewhere and that they haven&#39;t just vanished forever.&nbsp;</p><p>The latest entry in the franchise, spinoff game <em>Sackboy: A Big Adventure</em>, hit PS4 and PS5 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sackboy-a-big-adventure-online-multiplayer-delayed-ps5-ps4-184033689.html"><ins>last November</ins></a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-littlebigplanet-ps3-vita-servers-shut-down-163356541.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10c8cab2-46e6-44eb-acf5-411a1b142952</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:33:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1631550839</ingested><modified>2021-09-13T16:34:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6d7cf1e0-14af-11ec-bb4f-7cee9c1e811e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6d7cf1e0-14af-11ec-bb4f-7cee9c1e811e" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LittleBigPlanet 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LittleBigPlanet 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Steve Wozniak's latest moonshot is a private space company]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Steve Wozniak has started a company called Privateer Space.
