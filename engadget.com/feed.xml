Android 12 has now reached platform stability, meaning work is complete on most of the underlying tech. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-android-12-developer-preview-picture-in-picture-170049536.html"><ins>said in March</ins></a> it was hoping to hit platform stability in August, so it&#39;s right on track.</p><p>&quot;Android 12’s APIs and all app-facing behaviors are finalized,&quot; according to Google. That means developers can start their final Android 12 compatibility tests without worrying things will change much. A final Android 12 beta will emerge in the coming weeks.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Google is expected to roll out Android 12 broadly in the next couple of months, likely alongside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html"><ins>Pixel 6 lineup</ins></a>.

Here&#39;s everything the company showed off during its August 11th livestream.&nbsp;</p><h2></h2><h2>Galaxy Z Fold 3</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d2c05d20-fa4d-11eb-b6ae-611906031355" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3 with the camera app open in Flex mode" data-uuid="254b5367-06bc-30d7-8d35-2014c9c9ee95"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Unsurprisingly, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140051893.html">Galaxy Fold 3</a> headlined Samsung’s latest Unpacked event. One of the more noteworthy features of the foldable is that it includes an under-display camera. When it’s not in use, the Fold 3’s internal selfie shooter will attempt to blend in with the screen. While you can still see the component, particularly if your eyes drift to that part of the display, it helps make the device feel like more of a traditional tablet.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And speaking of tablets, you can use Samsung&#39;s S Pen stylus with the Galaxy Fold 3. The company devoted an entire segment of its Unpacked event to detailing the time and effort it invested to make the two compatible with one another. In short, the $50 S Pen Fold Edition and S Pen Pro feature rounder tips that can automatically retract if you apply too much pressure to the Fold 3’s internal display. Samsung also made the screen protector 80 percent stronger.</p><p>Once you get past those upgrades, a more capable Cover Display and the addition of IPX8-rated waterproofing, the one thing that stands out the most about the Fold 3 is that Samsung plans to sell it for a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:more palatable $1,800" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">more palatable $1,800</a>.

A lot of that has to do with the fact Samsung plans to sell its latest clamshell foldable for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,000" href="https://fave.co/3Ay0WkN">$1,000</a> when it comes out on August 27th. That’s a $200 price cut from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5g-price-cut-180002076.html">$1,200</a> Samsung started selling the Galaxy Z Flip 5G at the start of 2021 and puts it more inline with other high-end phones.&nbsp;</p><p>Critically, Samsung also outfitted the Flip 3 with a more usable Cover Display that is four times larger than the one found on its predecessor. That means there’s more room for notifications and widgets, and you can do things like access Android’s quick settings menu and Samsung Pay without opening the device.</p><h2>Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5912f9a0-fac1-11eb-a7e3-be3eb8f06587" alt="Galaxy Watch 4" data-uuid="c6a869cf-4f3e-30a5-ad5c-d8fb5744e786"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Once you get past the mouthful that is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html">Wear OS powered by Samsung</a>, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html">Galaxy Watch 4 </a>looks like it has a lot going for it. In our hands-on, we found the Galaxy Watch 4’s software had more in common with Tizen than Wear OS. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. All of the usual flourishes that made the company’s previous wearables compelling were still there, with the added advantage of better third-party app support.</p><p>In terms of hardware, Samsung added a 3-in-1 BioActive sensor that can measure your body fat percentage, a new 5nm processor and 50 percent more RAM. Those latter additions should make the Galaxy Watch 4 feel faster. What’s more, the more expensive Watch 4 Classic features the return of the company’s much-loved rotating bezel. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic" href="https://fave.co/3Az958F">Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic</a> will start at $249 and $349 when they hit store shelves on August 27th.</p><h2>Galaxy Buds 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b076cd20-fac1-11eb-bf75-b2305380f4a9" alt="Galaxy Buds 2" data-uuid="47c19e1e-34dc-3ffb-b919-8dcd1c7abd99"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele / Engadget</div></figure><h2></h2><p>Before closing out the event, Samsung announced the Galaxy Buds 2. They’re smaller and lighter than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review.html">Galaxy Buds+</a> and include active noise cancellation<strong>.  </strong>With the ANC feature, you have access to three adjustable ambient sound levels. Samsung also added a machine learning feature that will filter out noises when you’re using the Buds 2 to talk to someone over the phone.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We had a chance to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">review them</a> before today’s event and came away mostly impressed.

According to the board, Facebook mistakenly removed the post for violating its hate speech policy under the belief it targeted Chinese people.</p><p>&quot;This case highlights the importance of considering context when enforcing hate speech policies, as well as the importance of protecting political speech,&quot; the Oversight Board <a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/342799874210662-oversight-board-overturns-facebook-decision-case-2021-007-fb-ua/"><ins>wrote</ins></a>. &quot;This is particularly relevant in Myanmar given the February 2021 coup and Facebook’s key role as a communications medium in the country.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The user, who appeared to be in Myanmar, posted the message in question in April. The post argued that, rather than providing funding to Myanmar&#39;s military following <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-myawaddy-tv-station-171950609.html">the coup in February</a>, tax revenue should be given to the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hlutaw, a group of legislators that opposed the coup. The post, which was written in Burmese, was viewed around half a million times.</p><p>Although no users reported the post, Facebook decided to take it down. The post used profanity while referencing Chinese policy in Hong Kong. Facebook&#39;s translation of the post led four content reviewers to believe that the user was criticizing Chinese people.&nbsp;</p><p>Under its hate speech rules, Facebook doesn&#39;t allow content that targets someone or a group of people based on ethnicity, race or national origins that use “profane terms or phrases with the intent to insult.” The user who wrote the post claimed in their appeal that they shared it in an effort to “stop the brutal military regime.”</p><p>The Oversight Board says context is particularly important in this case. The Burmese language uses the same word to refer to both a state and people who are from that state. Other factors made it clear the user was referring to the Chinese state, according to the board.</p><p>Two translators who reviewed the post &quot;did not indicate any doubt&quot; that the word at the heart of the case was referring to a state. The translators told the board the post includes terms that Myanmar’s government and the Chinese embassy commonly use to refer to each other. <a href="https://scontent.fymq1-2.fna.fbcdn.net/m1/v/t0.41931-6/An-GdNo_tzvg5Mp6a8Jw9Ixx5mSBMa7G7sJBqaI4Vm-DV8D-OIZ9g3SqvtWB77eqZ2eVRTeny9K0bWEk9b63Sp5qJbgliRiKFXKZ5b93tGSiUPghLnGfowrHCwxiMwwxwgK9CnP5Taa1KtDzf1OdDRzZCA?ccb=10-5&amp;oh=def8e2cf3624fd9bcaf2fc279871b77d&amp;oe=61188B4D&amp;_nc_sid=340960"><ins>Public comments</ins></a> the board received regarding the case indicated the post was political speech.</p><p>The Oversight Board ordered Facebook to restore the post and recommended Facebook ensures &quot;its Internal Implementation Standards are available in the language in which content moderators review content. If necessary to prioritize, Facebook should focus first on contexts where the risks to human rights are more severe.&quot;</p><p>The company has had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-27-facebook-bans-military-myanmar-un-report.html"><ins>complicated history</ins></a> with Myanmar. In 2018, Facebook was accused of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-20-facebook-accused-of-supporting-ethnic-cleansing-in-myanmar.html"><ins>censoring information</ins></a> about ethnic cleansing in the country. It <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-06-facebook-myanmar-bsr-report.html"><ins>admitted</ins></a> it didn&#39;t do enough to stop people from using the platform to incite offline violence and &quot;foment division,&quot; following a report <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-15-facebook-investigating-myanmar-violence.html"><ins>it commissioned</ins></a> about the matter.</p><p>Soon after the coup, Facebook was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/myanmar-blocks-facebook-232138617.html"><ins>temporarily blocked</ins></a> in Myanmar. After it returned, Facebook took steps to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-limiting-myanmar-military-reach-065458912.html"><ins>limit the reach</ins></a> of the country&#39;s military on its platform, and later <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-myanmar-military-ban-151924455.html"><ins>banned the military outright</ins></a> on Facebook and Instagram.</p><p>The Oversight Board previously told Facebook to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-initial-judgments-141352775.html"><ins>restore a post</ins></a> from another user based in Myanmar. As with the latest ruling, the board said Facebook misinterpreted the post as hate speech. While it was “pejorative or offensive,” the post didn&#39;t “advocate hatred” or directly call for violence.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-myanmar-coup-restore-post-china-164304497.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e3fb4ab-5c88-4647-ae04-6a218d606ba4</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 16:43:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628700189</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T16:43:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/54039d80-fac0-11eb-aedd-3f3dfff0e68e" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/54039d80-fac0-11eb-aedd-3f3dfff0e68e" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A member of the local Myanmar (Burmese) diaspora holding a national flag of Myanmar seen in front of the GPO in Dublin at a pro-democracy rally called 'Global Spring Revolution' for Myanmar.

To start, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-family-bell-smart-speaker-display-150006076.html">Family Bell</a> is coming to mobile devices.

Search <a href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/periodic-table/">now has</a> an interactive periodic table that uses augmented reality and 3D to help children visualize atoms and learn useful tidbits about the elements. On their phones, young ones can tap a Live Translation button in search to recall a particular phrase. Assistant will also offer more diverse educational stories from The English Schoolhouse, while Harry Potter fans will have the option of listening to <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> stories on Android or Assistant smart displays.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>And yes, there&#39;s something for the parents who need to get moving.

Ambient sound, wireless charging and other premium features were already standard on the company’s earbuds, but with the Pro it added true active noise cancellation (ANC), 360 audio and more. Now Samsung is circling back and redesigning its entry-level buds. With the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Buds 2" href="https://fave.co/3CHY5b8">Galaxy Buds 2</a>, the company brings features typically reserved for its pricer models to a set of $150 earbuds, reducing the number of tradeoffs that are usually required if you want to spend a little less.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="4dc945a4-a14b-4580-9098-25f7c7f6a629"/><h2><strong>Design</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d2d9a2-faa6-11eb-beb7-56bc5471380c" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds. This successor to the Galaxy Buds+ are smaller and more comfortable with premium features like wireless charging and adjustable ambient sound. However, ANC performance is only decent and there&#x002019;s no deep iOS integration like previous models. Still, at this price, Samsung has created a compelling package despite the sacrifices. " data-uuid="8f822d4b-6ed0-3b7f-9f67-7563a3ea58e5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>For the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung ditched the triangular touch panel and fit wing for an oval shape that’s reminiscent of the Galaxy Buds Pro. The outer panel is seamless, so you can’t tell where the touch controls are exactly. There’s no button or frame outlining them; the only things visible on the outside are two of the three microphones, one of which replaces the tiny grille on the Pro model.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Samsung says the Galaxy Buds 2 are 15-percent smaller and 20-percent lighter than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review.html">Galaxy Buds+</a> which were already quite tiny. This makes them noticeably smaller than the Galaxy Buds Pro as well, even though the overall design is similar. The Galaxy Buds 2 aren’t as deep, which accounts for their more compact stature. Indeed, Samsung’s smallest and lightest earbuds yet are also some of its most comfortable. These earbuds are among the tiniest I’ve tested and the size helps them nestle snugly in your ear without the burden of extra weight or the protruding design you get with larger models.</p><p>Like the Galaxy Buds Pro, the outer touch panel area of the Galaxy Buds 2 has a glossy finish, although this new model is clearly made of plastic. The Pro version has a bit of metallic character, giving them a more premium look. Samsung kept the same IPX2 rating, which means you should be fine if you get caught in some drizzle, but frequent splashes and  sweaty workouts might cause problems.</p><p>The cases for both the Galaxy Buds 2 and Galaxy Buds Pro are nearly identical. They’re the exact same size and shape: a small square with rounded corners. With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung opted for a glossy finish over the previous matte exterior. Plus, every case for this new model is white, no matter which color bud you choose. Only the interior cradle that holds the earbuds and the thin seam where the case closes matches your hue preference. A single LED up front keeps you aware of the charging status while a USB-C port around back is available for wired top-ups.</p><h2><strong>Software</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d4d570-faa6-11eb-bfff-a6ccb0330834" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

" data-uuid="8bfaf659-678c-3b61-ad60-9017c55ab6e7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung’s Galaxy Wearable app is where you access all of the controls and settings for the Galaxy Buds 2, just like it was for the company’s other recent earbuds. This includes the ability to switch between ANC, ambient sound and both off as well as adjusting ambient sound levels, reassigning the touch and hold gesture, selecting an EQ preset, activating hands-free Bixby and checking battery percentage. It’s also where you can employ Samsung’s Find My Earbuds feature should you misplace a bud.</p><p>Touch controls are mirrored on both sides by default with a single tap for play/pause, a double tap to skip tracks ahead and a triple tap to return to the previous song. A touch and hold function switches between active noise cancellation and ambient sound. You can’t adjust the level of environmental noise you let in on the earbuds; this just returns to your last selection. There is the option to set this to toggle between ANC and off or ambient sound and off if you dive further into the settings. You can also choose to disable all of the touch controls entirely or one or more of them individually.</p><p>Samsung gives you the ability to reconfigure the touch and hold option, but you have limited alternatives. You can set it to activate Bixby, give you one-touch access to Spotify or on-board volume control. If you choose that last option, you can only assign volume down to the left earbud and volume up to the right. As was the case with previous Galaxy Buds, a full suite of volume controls means you lose access to something handy like ANC/ambient sound.</p><p>Similar to lots of other companies, Samsung has once again included an ear tip fit test in its app. This short diagnostic plays a few seconds of sound to ensure optimal audio quality and noise cancellation.</p><p>Samsung offered deep iOS integration on the Galaxy Buds+. In fact, you got nearly all of the same features on your iPhone as someone with a Galaxy device. The company backed off of that with its recent products and continues to do so with the Galaxy Buds 2. You’ll need an Android phone to dive into all the Galaxy Wearable app offers. Samsung also has a Galaxy Buds app for Windows, but if you’re hoping to use these new earbuds with an iPhone, iPad or Mac, just know you’re stuck with the default settings.</p><h2><strong>Sound quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d43930-faa6-11eb-bfff-007b5841bd5a" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

However, ANC performance is only decent and there&#x002019;s no deep iOS integration like previous models. Still, at this price, Samsung has created a compelling package despite the sacrifices. " data-uuid="11a42b15-cd74-3e51-9972-3738514c73e8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The audio quality hasn’t ever been mind-blowing on Samsung’s more affordable Galaxy Buds. It was a huge disappointment on the original model, but the company made some improvements to the low-end on the Buds+. Still, overall sound quality needed work. With the Galaxy Buds 2, the company has made some strides that bring its $150 model more in line with the pricier Galaxy Buds Pro. This new version doesn’t have the same clarity and depth as its more expensive sibling, but the dynamic range is at least comparable.</p><p>Things definitely sound compressed on the Galaxy Buds 2. There’s ample bass and enough treble for certain details to cut through, but low-end tone lacks punch and tracks that are meant to sound big and bombastic are somewhat subdued. On the Buds Pro, songs like CHVRCHES “How Not to Down” are nicely layered creations of drums, piano and other instruments with airy vocals sitting on top. That all sounds noticeably flatter when I switch to the Galaxy Buds 2. It’s better than the Galaxy Buds+, but it’s worth noting that although the Galaxy Buds 2 are balanced, the company could do better when it comes to details and depth.</p><p>The EQ presets in the Galaxy Wearable app don’t offer any improvement over the default (Normal) mode. All of the options seem to pipe in too much bass, mids or treble depending on which one you select, and a few of them feel muffled.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d375e0-faa6-11eb-bc6f-ea61e8b7666d" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

" data-uuid="e7fc9ed0-268d-3cb1-bbba-05916a1e2a85"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>For the first time, Samsung is offering active noise cancellation on its most affordable Galaxy Buds. The Buds+ had an ambient sound mode, but they didn’t do anything to block environmental ruckus beyond passive noise isolation. The ANC on the Galaxy Buds 2 will help reduce distractions but it&#39;s not as powerful as pricer earbuds can muster. Samsung says the setup on this model can reduce 98 percent of background noise, but things like a white noise machine and box fans cut through to varying degrees. It’s definitely better than passive isolation on its own, but if you’re interested in earbuds that block out nearly everything, you’ll want to look elsewhere. Lastly, there’s also only one setting here where the Galaxy Buds Pro offers options for high and low noise cancellation.</p><p>Like the Pro model, the Galaxy Buds 2 is equipped with adjustable ambient sound. However, where the Galaxy Buds Pro has four levels, these new earbuds only have three. It’s basically a volume adjustment for how much environmental noise you’re letting in.</p><p>One other new feature with the Galaxy Buds 2 is available on the new Galaxy Watch 4. With that wearable, a new Buds Controller puts noise controls on your wrist. This gives you the ability to switch between ANC and ambient sound. It will come in handy if you decide to remove that option from the earbuds’ touch controls. You can also view battery status on the Watch 4 as well as disable the touch controls entirely if needed.</p><h2><strong>Call quality</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d2d9a1-faa6-11eb-bddb-2c1ca2db5a31" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

" data-uuid="b556d306-a7b9-351a-a23b-4eb7d5e726e8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung is once again making big promises about call quality on the Galaxy Buds 2. The company says the combination of machine learning alongside three microphones per earbud and a voice pickup unit (VPU) &quot;maximizes call clarity in all conditions.&quot; In practice, the earbuds actually do combat background noise to a degree. They don’t entirely get rid of it, but they can reduce things like background conversations and the TV a low roar, according to the person on the other end of my calls. My wife noted that while I still sounded like I was on speaker phone, the noise around me was subdued when either of us began to talk. It’s not pristine call quality, but at least Samsung delivers on some of its claims here.</p><h2><strong>Battery life</strong></h2><p>Samsung is promising up to five hours of battery life on the Galaxy Buds 2 themselves with an additional three charges in the case (20 hours total). That’s with active noise cancellation turned on. If you disable that feature, the company says you can expect up to seven and a half hours on a charge (29 hours total with the case). Like all of the previous Galaxy Buds devices, the case supports wireless charging via Qi-certified devices and Samsung’s Power Share feature on the back of its phones. There’s a quick charge option on the Galaxy Buds 2 as well that gives you an hour of non-ANC listening time after five minutes.</p><p>While five hours isn’t exactly impressive, the range for the Galaxy Buds 2 is on par with a lot of true wireless earbuds I’ve tested recently. It may not be enough to last an entire trans-continental flight, but it might get you through a full day of work, especially if you can disable noise cancellation for a spell. During my tests, I managed just over seven hours of what I’d consider “regular” use. That’s a mix of ANC, ambient sound at varying levels, calls and only using one earbud at any given time.</p><h2><strong>The competition</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d327c0-faa6-11eb-badd-9a0ea7f120a2" alt="With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-review-150014566.html">Beats Studio Buds</a> are a recent entry, offering nearly identical battery life to the Galaxy Buds 2. The only difference there is Samsung gives you one more charge in the case. The Studio Buds don’t support wireless charging and there are no options for customizing the sound, but the audio is balanced and the earbuds are tiny and comfy. Beats tossed in quick pairing support for both Android and iOS, and with the latter, you get hands-free access to Siri. They’re also the exact same price as the Galaxy Buds 2, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/beats-studio-buds-sale-130-amazon-133550651.html">unless you can find them on sale</a>.</p><p>For around $150, I’m also a big fan of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">Jabra Elite 75t</a>. These earbuds are getting a little long in the tooth after a late-2019 debut, but the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-75t-anc-upgrade-150546951.html">added active noise cancellation</a> through a firmware update last fall. If you purchase a set now, they’ll ship with ANC already installed. You’ll have to pay extra for a wireless charging case, but once again, battery life is nearly identical to the Galaxy Buds 2. Jabra also massively improved the audio quality on the 75t and a new design is smaller and more comfy. Although the Elite 75t debuted at $180, you can find them nowadays for <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:around $150" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X9VG6ZJ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;language=en_US">around $150</a>, but some colors are available <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:on Amazon for as little as $90" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082Y256ZV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=productpost2021-20&amp;language=en_US">on Amazon for as little as $90</a>.</p><h2><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h2><p>With the exception of the Galaxy Buds Live, Samsung has a solid track record with its recent earbuds. That’s true once again with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Buds 2" href="https://fave.co/3CHY5b8">Galaxy Buds 2</a> where a tiny curved design keeps things comfy even for long periods of time. The company brought all of what made the Buds+ a solid affordable true wireless option back and added active noise cancellation to what is now its cheapest model. Sure, the audio could be better, but the combination of features and price make the Galaxy Buds 2 a solid option for Android users. And if you own a Samsung phone, you’ll get even more out of them.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f1770c5a-4638-42d6-84e9-92d861f211a1</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 15:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628695257</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T15:21:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/efd486d0-faa6-11eb-b94f-10d8b46c6c7b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/efd486d0-faa6-11eb-b94f-10d8b46c6c7b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 revivew]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 revivew]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[WhatsApp will let you transfer your chat history between Android and iOS]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WhatsApp is finally addressing one of the biggest problems with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-encrypted-cloud-backups-android-test-215012026.html">chat histories</a>: the inability to carry them over when you switch platforms.

Instead, the company just announced a couple of new foldable smartphones along with a revamped smartwatch and new wireless earbuds. Samsung showed off the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140051893.html">Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-flip-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140057384.html">Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G</a> during a virtual event today, reiterating how serious the company is about complementing its standard, slab smartphones with these flexible devices. But as to be expected, these unique smartphones come with high prices — the Z Flip 3 starts at $999 while the Z Fold 3 will set you back $1,799. If you&#39;re willing to pay the price to have a not-so-typical smartphone, here&#39;s how you can pre-order all of Samsung&#39;s latest devices, including the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and the Galaxy Z Flip 3.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/13f1f9d0-f9ee-11eb-af1d-5af77c9a1905" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G" data-uuid="ffdbe670-1264-3d8d-8dc9-16753a996016"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Fold 3 5G starts at $1,799 and is available to pre-order today from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">Samsung&#39;s website</a>.

The Z Fold 3 has a 7.6-inch, 2208 x 1768 Infinity Flex AMOLED display plus a 6.2-inch HD+ Dynamic AMOLED cover screen — both of which have 120Hz adaptive refresh rates. The main screen uses new eco technology that makes it 29 percent bright than its predecessor while consuming less energy. We thought the Z Fold 2 already had a decent battery life, and this new display technology could help the Z Fold 3 last even longer.</p><p>Samsung also brought its S Pen technology to its foldables this year, allowing you to take notes, scribble and the like on the Z Fold 3. The company has two new styli — the S Pen Fold and the S Pen Pro — and both have a retractable tip with &quot;force limit technology&quot; that should protect the Z Fold 3&#39;s main screen even while you&#39;re using it.</p><p>As far as specs go, the Z Fold 3 5G runs Android 11 on an octa-core processor, 12GB of RAM and either 256GB of 512GB of storage. It has a 4,400mAh battery and supports wireless charging. The handset has 10-megapixel selfie camera, a 4MP under-display camera plus a triple rear camera array that includes a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 12MP wide angle lens and a 12MP telephoto shooter.</p><h2>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4eea4240-f9ee-11eb-8b8f-c70ada557297" alt="Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G" data-uuid="60f935ea-6531-3b1e-86c5-aca16b4b948c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The Galaxy Z Flip 3 5G starts at $999 and is available to pre-order today from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/3Ay0WkN">Samsung&#39;s website</a>.

While the Z Flip 3 probably won&#39;t be completely free of uncertainty when it comes to staying power, Samsung did try to rectify some of the problems with the previous model. The cover screen on the Z Flip 3 is four times larger than that of its predecessor, which means it&#39;ll show more information and be more useful overall. Samsung also created new widgets for the cover screen that provide glanceable information about your schedule, the weather and more.</p><p>The main screen is a 6.7-inch, 2640 x 1080 Infinity Flex AMOLED panel with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. Samsung hasn&#39;t provided additional information about the screen&#39;s durability, but we hope it&#39;s more resistant to scratches than the previous Z Flip&#39;s screen was. Flex Mode remains a feature for the screen as well, and it appears you&#39;ll be able to do more things with Flex Mode on the Z Flip 3 like watching a video on the top half of the display while being able to access controls for brightness and volume on the bottom half.</p><p>On the specs side, the Z Flip 3 5G runs Android 11 on an octa-core processor, 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage. It has a 3,300mAh battery and supports wireless charging. The handset also has a 10MP selfie camera along with a dual-lens setup on the rear that includes a 12MP ultra-wide angle lens and a 12MP wide angle camera.</p><h2>Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e2f3dd0-f9ee-11eb-b079-18ec9c8b8828" alt="Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and Galaxy Watch 4 Classic" data-uuid="2ae52647-4649-303b-a3c4-d99e259315d4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>Both the Galaxy Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic are available for pre-order today from <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/3Az958F">Samsung&#39;s website</a> and will be available widely on August 27.

The watches run on Google&#39;s operating system but use the new &quot;One UI Watch&quot; interface. The new system does things like automatically install the watch version of an app when the mobile app is installed on your smartphone, and automatically sync phone and watch settings like do not disturb.</p><p>The Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic also have Samsung&#39;s new &quot;BioActive sensor,&quot; which combines optical heart rate, ECG and bioelectrical impedance analysis in one sensor. That means the watches monitor heart rate — including irregular heart rate — blood oxygen levels, body composition and even blood pressure (although the latter is not available in the US). The BioActive sensor accompanies a GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer and geomagnetic and light sensors inside the watches. A bevy of additional fitness features are available on each watch as well, including guided workouts, sleep tracking and more.</p><p>The differences between the Galaxy Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic are mostly in design. The Watch 4 has a more minimalist look and comes in fun colors like pink gold, green and silver. The Watch 4 Classic has a more traditional design and comes in black and silver. Both models have the same full-color, Super AMOLED, always-on touchscreens, but their cases sizes are a bit different. The Galaxy Watch 4&#39;s aluminum case comes in 40mm and 44mm sizes, while the Watch 4 Classic&#39;s stainless steel case (which features a rotating bezel) comes in 42mm and 46mm sizes.</p><p>Under the screen, you&#39;ll find a 5nm Exynos processor in both the Watch 4 and the Watch 4 Classic, along with 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage. LTE is available on both wearables, but WiFi, Bluetooth and NFC are standard features.</p><h2>Galaxy Buds 2</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a257ae40-f9ee-11eb-baff-e5f379755b14" alt="Samsung Galaxy Buds 2" data-uuid="18b11ffe-2c50-3f4c-801c-eeaddd4c9fa8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>The Galaxy Buds 2 are available for pre-order today on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#39;s website" href="https://fave.co/3CHY5b8">Samsung&#39;s website</a> for $150 and they come in graphite, white, olive and lavender colors.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-specs-price-availability-140039706.html">Buds 2</a> are Samsung&#39;s smallest and lightest yet and they support active noise-cancellation with three adjustable ambient sound levels.

It’s a smartphone that folds in on itself to become half its size and features a new external display that’s four times larger than the one on its predecessor. Though it lacks the S Pen support offered on the Z Fold 3, the Flip 3’s bendable screen still delivers a 120Hz refresh rate that makes scrolling and animation rendering smoother. It’s also water resistant and can process contactless payments when it’s shut, making it more useful in its smaller mode. Just as important, it now costs $1,000, down from $1,300, making it not affordable, exactly, but on par with other flagship smartphones. At a brief hands-on event in New York, I was able to check out the Flip 3’s upgrades and am cautiously hopeful that this is the first foldable I’m ready to buy.</p><p>The Flip 3’s non-sequential name might be slightly baffling (the last two models were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review.html">the Z Flip</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-unlocked-galaxy-z-flip-5g-preorder-060104358.html">Z Flip 5G</a>), but for the most part, all of its upgrades feel self-explanatory. The most obvious is the larger external screen — or, as Samsung calls it, the Cover Display. Instead of the 1.1-inch sliver from the original Flip, the new Cover Display measures 1.9 inches diagonally, giving users four times the screen real estate. This means you can see more of your notifications or widgets at once (up to four lines, according to Samsung). You can also swipe through up to six widgets on this screen, and the options available include things like Samsung Pay, Weather, Alarms, volume control, media playback and step count.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As before, you can tap and swipe to interact with this screen, and I scrolled vertically on the Flip 3’s Cover Display to toggle through clock, volume control and Samsung Pay widgets. It was nice being able to drag the slider on this screen to make the phone louder, but I could also use physical keys on the side. Other widgets are probably more useful, and Samsung will need to encourage developers to create them for their apps. There weren’t any notifications on my demo unit, though, so I didn’t get to see how that would look. Side-swiping on this panel also didn’t do anything, though this likely depends on what the widgets themselves are designed to support.</p><p>The other benefit of a larger Cover Display is when you’re using it to frame a selfie with the Flip 3 closed. Of all the nostalgic value that using a flip phone brings, snapping a selfie with a tiny outside screen and camera is the one thing that immediately brings me back to the 2000s. (I was one of many who used a pink Motorola Razr V3 circa 2003-4.)</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/aeacab00-fa3e-11eb-a3fb-20c33d1fec3d" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-uuid="53494b8c-f510-3ac5-b602-e9ddd7baad5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith / Engadget                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </div></figure><p>Of course, I’m not suggesting you rely on the Flip 3’s relatively cramped Cover Display and 10-megapixel selfie camera as your primary means of shooting portraits. But in a pinch, the new larger window is more useful than its predecessor’s in gauging what you’re snapping. I used it to capture a couple of selfies at my demo session using the volume buttons on the phone’s edge as triggers. Though I couldn’t see all of the scene in the viewfinder, it was enough to get my colleague and I centered in the frame.</p><p>Open up the Flip 3, set it up in a half-folded mode, and you’ll see the Camera app expand to take up the whole 6.7-inch screen. Samsung calls this view Flex Mode, and compatible apps automatically rearrange themselves so that their layouts align with the top and bottom halves of the display. In the Gallery app, for example, the bottom section becomes sort of a navigation pad where you can swipe sideways to scroll through your pictures in a carousel. In the Camera app, the viewfinder takes up the top half while controls sit on the bottom.</p><p>I didn’t have time at our briefing to try out every app, but so far I’ve noticed that Camera and Gallery supports Flex Mode while Photos, Maps and Chrome do not. The ones that do also switch between Flex Mode and full-screen very quickly, which is a promising sign of the Flip 3’s processor’s performance. The device will have the same chipset as the Fold 3, which in the US is the Snapdragon 888, and it’ll come with 8GB of RAM along with 128GB or 256GB of storage.</p><p>Samsung said it’s working with developers to optimize more apps for Flex Mode and that it has already enabled at least 50 percent of the most popular options. Thankfully, it’s not like you can’t use your favorite app if it’s not optimized for Flex Mode; it just won’t be laid out as nicely.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/56d925c0-fa3e-11eb-b3df-f3a11c876eca" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-uuid="1385c70e-52b5-3e39-979b-a0684ce822d3"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>In addition to the larger cover display, the Flip 3’s upgrades over its predecessors include support for adaptive 120Hz refresh rate on its internal screen. This made quickly scrolling through the list of articles on Engadget’s homepage look smooth, and will likely make the system feel faster overall. Though the 22:9 aspect ratio is taller than most phones today, I didn’t find it too jarring. Meanwhile, images looked colorful and crisp on the Full HD+ display.</p><p>One more improvement that Samsung made on the Flip 3 is its water resistance rating of IPX8. There weren’t any setups at the demo event for me to test this out, so we’ll have to take Samsung at its word for now.</p><p>Like the Z Fold 3, the new Flip features some overall durability improvements. Samsung used a new “Armor Aluminum” in its metal frame and hinge that makes the phone 10 percent stronger, while the company said the Gorilla Glass covering the device is 50 percent more durable than previous models. The main screen also uses a new protective film that’s said to be stronger and more scratch resistant. These durability claims aren’t something I can vouch for yet as I didn’t try dropping or scratching our demo units, but I can say that the Flip 3’s hinge moved smoothly and stayed open at various angles. I was also able to close the phone with one hand, albeit without the same satisfying <em>thunk</em> that Razrs made.</p><p>Despite all its durability upgrades, the Flip 3 is about just as light and thin as the Flip 5G, though the new phone is slightly smaller. Samsung is offering the Flip 3 in seven colors this time around, and while I still love the purple version, the green option is also gorgeous. Oh, and don’t forget the Thom Browne edition that will also be available in a Team USA color scheme in a nod to the Olympics.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d3a1e150-fa3e-11eb-b7fe-cc3037eb3e5b" alt="Galaxy Z Flip 3" data-uuid="3c52a230-0ba6-3777-b7c0-8e462d875ec5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Everything else about the Flip 3 is pretty much the same as before. You’ll still get a 3,300mAh battery, a 12-megapixel rear camera and a 10-megapixel one for selfies, which produced nice enough samples during my hands-on. But battery life and image quality are among the many things we’ll need proper review units to test out in the real world.</p><p>Though I’m excited that Samsung has managed to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:drop the Z Flip 3&#x002019;s price down to $1,000" href="https://fave.co/3Ay0WkN">drop the Z Flip 3’s price down to $1,000</a> while adding water resistance, improving the overall build and Cover Display, I’d like to see how the software updates add to its experience as a daily driver. But from my brief preview, the Z Flip 3 might be the first foldable device I’m ready to invest in and could finally make the category ready for the mainstream.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Unpacked event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/galaxy%20unpacked%20foldables"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-flip-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140057384.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fdfa2c18-1e76-499e-bbd3-a61b1488c4ea</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 14:00:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628690946</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T14:09:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2c915350-fa3e-11eb-bb6f-93f07246a510" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2c915350-fa3e-11eb-bb6f-93f07246a510" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Galaxy Z Flip 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Galaxy Z Flip 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Galaxy Z Fold 3 hands-on: Built stronger for durability and S Pen support]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="d2077aee97b045c58af030c9a9f2cb78"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMZUbadgHgI" title="YouTube video player" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></div><p>It’s hard to believe that in just a matter of years, foldable devices have gone from the stuff of science fiction to actual usable daily drivers. Here we are today, checking out the <em>third </em>generation of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Samsung&#x002019;s foldables" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">Samsung’s foldables</a>, which the company just launched at its Unpacked event. The Fold 3 is the bigger, more premium of the new pair of bendy offerings, and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-22-samsung-galaxy-fold-review-expensive-experiment.html">Fold series has been around longer</a> than any other folding phone. Since launching the original, Samsung has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-18-galaxy-fold-broken-screens-samsung.html">worked to improve durability</a> and software, which continue to be the two biggest challenges for foldables.</p><p>The Z Fold 3 is also the first of its kind to support Samsung&#39;s S Pen, meaning you can write or draw on the larger canvas without breaking the screen.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In addition to stylus support, the Z Fold 3 features water resistance, a new under display camera in the larger screen and a stronger build that Samsung says brings an 80-percent increase in durability. Best of all, it starts at a cheaper $1,800. At a socially distanced preview event in New York, I was able to check out the Z Fold 3 and am so far pleased with what I&#39;ve seen.</p><p><strong>S Pen support</strong></p><p>Given my limited time with the device, I focused on checking out things that are new, starting with the $50 S Pen Fold Edition and $100 S Pen Pro. For these versions, Samsung made the nib rounder than on older styli, so they’re less likely to tear into the screen. If you apply too much force with the pen, its nib will retract. For those who are concerned that the nib might be too sensitive and slide back into its housing at the slightest touch, I can say that it took a fair amount of effort for that to happen during my hands-on.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5e039150-fa4d-11eb-bfbf-4364ae2d7d32" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-uuid="75fe7752-38d4-32c0-881b-5a53e1fade3b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Though the 1.5mm nib is rounder and more than twice as thick as older S Pens, I didn’t find it too large and it was still very precise. I was able to draw fine lines and sketch thicker ones by applying more force, thanks to the 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity.</p><p>Samsung said the durability and latency on this screen are better than any other pen-compatible device it offers, and while I can’t make a direct comparison yet, the stylus did feel responsive and fluid in my brief preview. You can spend a little more to get the S Pen Pro, which also works with the Fold 3. It’s bigger, longer and supports Bluetooth for remote controls. Unlike the Fold Edition, the Pro model needs power and has a USB-C slot at the top for charging.</p><p>You can only use either S Pen on the internal screen, by the way — the cover display does not support pen input. There&#39;s also no slot for the stylus so you&#39;ll have to find a way to make sure you don&#39;t misplace it.</p><p><strong>Multitasking software and under display camera</strong></p><p>With the unfolded display, you can use multiple apps at once. The 22.5:18 aspect ratio is uncommon, which is why on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review-5g-foldable-phone-specs-price-143057288.html">previous Folds</a>, many apps like Instagram and Netflix didn’t completely fill the screen and were awkwardly flanked by empty space.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b8198c80-fa4d-11eb-87ff-1e642a6ec399" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3 close up on the under display camera with Google Maps open onscreen." data-uuid="62e97a01-fdca-3923-8bd5-6345db7dcb99"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung has worked on a few experimental features to make Android apps work better on the roomier canvas. Under Labs in settings, you&#39;ll find options to choose 16:9, 4:3 or fullscreen as the default aspect ratios that apps launch in. You can also enable Multi Window for all apps, which allows them to open in floating panels or split screen, even if they weren’t designed for those layouts. There are also options to auto rotate apps and use a Flex mode panel that makes better use of the screen space when the system detects that the Fold is half-open.</p><p>At my demo session, I launched the Camera app on the Fold 3 and it expanded to take up the whole screen when I opened the device all the way till the hinge clicked in place. When I folded it slightly, the app split in half, with thumbnails of photos in my camera roll on the left side and the viewfinder and controls on the right. As I snapped more pictures, they quickly showed up on the carousel on the left. I was impressed with how responsive the system was — the app switched between Flex and fullscreen modes with no delay.</p><p>There aren’t many apps that support Flex Mode at the moment, but Samsung said it’s working with developers to encourage adoption. One more thing the company did to make multitasking on the Fold 3 easier is add an option to pin the Edge panel on the side to get a taskbar-like experience a la Windows or Chrome. I can’t vouch for how useful this will be in the real world yet but I like the idea in theory.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d2c05d20-fa4d-11eb-b6ae-611906031355" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3 with the camera app open in Flex mode" data-uuid="254b5367-06bc-30d7-8d35-2014c9c9ee95"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>To make the larger screen feel more immersive, Samsung used a new Under Display Camera (UDC) on the Fold 3 that camouflages the 4-megapixel sensor under some pixels. At least, that’s the theory. I was confused at first when I looked at the Fold 3’s main screen with a dark wallpaper and could clearly see the camera. Then I opened Google Maps and the small dark circle that’s the sensor disappeared under the blues and greens of the world. Well, sort of. There was still a ring of pixelation, but it was only obvious because I was looking for it.</p><p>The distortion is there because that part of the display has spaces between its pixels to let light through to the sensor underneath. It was noticeable in Maps, but less so in Chrome, where the top row of the screen was more evenly colored. I didn’t find it too distracting when I jumped between apps or browsed the Engadget website, and I wouldn’t be surprised if I got used to it over time.</p><p>The sample photos I got with the UDC were decent, although I’d still prefer using the main sensors on the other side of the Fold 3 for selfies or landscapes. This under-screen option is mostly there for video calls.</p><p><strong>Updated screens and stronger build</strong></p><p>Software and a UDC aren’t the only improvements to the Fold 3’s screens. Both the 7.6-inch interior display and the 6.2-inch external one now support adaptive 120Hz refresh rates. For the cover screen, that’s twice what it was before. The front panel is still somewhat low-res at 2,268 x 832, while the bigger one inside is 2,208 x 1,768. At least they’re both AMOLEDs. That means colors look richer, blacks are deeper and contrast ratios are higher than on LCD smartphones.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4d704040-fa4d-11eb-b3ff-970d017ac9c0" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3" data-uuid="f91d9006-0070-3349-ac92-c437836ba689"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>To support the S Pen, Samsung also redid the Fold 3’s display stack and added a Wacom layer. While it did that, it also used a new stretchable PET5 (Polyethylene terephthalate) material in the Fold 3’s factory-installed screen protector. Compared to its previous foldables, Samsung claims this screen is 80 percent more durable.</p><p>The Fold 3 also features a stronger build than previous versions, and for the first time since Samsung started selling foldables, this year’s Z-series phones are rated IPX8 for water resistance. I didn’t get to test this at our demo, but I appreciate the peace of mind that will give me when I inevitably get caught in the rain or accidentally spill water all over a review unit.</p><p>The company also used something it calls “Armor Aluminum” in the Fold 3’s frame and hinge. That’s “the strongest aluminum ever used on a Galaxy smartphone,” Samsung said. It also covered the Fold 3 in Gorilla Glass Victus, which it said is 50 percent hardier than what it used on its older devices. Again, I didn’t want to drop or scratch the demo unit under the watchful eyes of Samsung reps at my preview, so I can’t say how well these will withstand the bumps of daily life yet. But the hinge did feel sturdy as I opened and shut the device repeatedly. Plus, as I pushed my thumb into the middle of the edge to close the Fold 3, I didn’t feel like I was going to damage it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/05d4b030-fa4e-11eb-ab7e-3a4343d8eb16" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3 cover display" data-uuid="f6fcb3a9-2df6-3440-bebc-f651f18b7089"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Although it made the device more durable, Samsung was still able to shave off a few grams and millimeters. The Fold 3 weighs 271 grams (0.6 pounds) and measures 6.4mm (0.25 inches) thick, which is thinner and lighter than <a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/galaxy-z-fold2-change-shape-of-future-unpacked2/?utm_source=pr_media&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=unpacked">the Z Fold 2</a> (282 grams, 6.9mm). These are subtle enough differences that the new Fold doesn’t feel much smaller than its predecessor, but even an 11-gram weight loss can make it easier to use the device for longer.</p><p>A more noticeable change is the new slate of colors. The Fold 3 is available in silver, green or black, and my favorite of these is the green. It’s a muted forest green, unlike the pastel hue on the iPhone 12 or the understated jade of the Pixel 5. Compared to these shades, the Fold 3’s looked the classiest.</p><p><strong>Wrap-up</strong></p><p>Three generations in, Samsung has clearly learned a lot and the Z Fold 3, at least based on this preview, feels very refined. Plus, its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:lower starting price of $1,800" href="https://fave.co/3AwEhoV">lower starting price of $1,800</a> is more palatable than the Fold 2’s $2,000. But does that mean Samsung has perfected its foldable formula, and is the Fold 3 ready for the average consumer? Even at its new price, it’s probably still too expensive for most people. For early adopters curious about things like battery life and camera performance, I can’t gauge these till I can test the Fold 3 out in the real world. But for the first time since the original Fold, I can see a future where foldable phones will be embraced by a mainstream audience.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Unpacked event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/galaxy%20unpacked%20foldables"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-fold-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140051893.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1eeea40d-dd33-4761-a57f-45cd70539199</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 14:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628690865</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T14:08:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/357d9320-fa4d-11eb-9cdc-f0e70604cb60" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/811c3f70-fa4d-11eb-aeb8-0af193639305" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mat Smith / Engadget                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Galaxy Z Fold 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Galaxy Z Fold 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Galaxy Buds 2 bring ANC to Samsung's most affordable true wireless earbuds]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung&#39;s two most recent sets of true wireless earbuds included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-140007680.html">an &quot;open-type&quot; design</a> that elicited a bevy of bean jokes and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-review-163027027.html">a full-featured noise-cancelling option</a>. The company&#39;s more affordable <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-21-samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review.html">Galaxy Buds+</a> debuted in early 2020 and Samsung is introducing the follow-up to that model today with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Buds 2" href="https://fave.co/3CHY5b8">Galaxy Buds 2</a>. The new entry-level option in the Galaxy Buds lineup remains $150, but the company added active noise cancellation (ANC) to a design that&#39;s similar to pricier Galaxy Buds Pro.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung ditched the triangular design from the Galaxy Buds and Galaxy Buds+ in favor of a more ergonomic egg-shaped earbud. The Galaxy Buds 2 are also 15 percent smaller and 20 percent lighter than the Galaxy Buds+, and those were already quite small. Of course, the smaller size helps keep things comfy and it means that there&#39;s less earbud to stick out from your head. However, like the Galaxy Buds Pro, the Galaxy Buds 2 are only IPX2 rated against water droplets. That means you should be okay if you get caught in the rain, but extra sweaty workouts and splashes could be a problem.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company&#39;s curvy square charging case returns as well, though this time the case is white no matter which color earbuds you choose. Only the interior of the case and a small band around the seam matches the buds inside. Quick pairing is back for compatible devices, where all you need to do is open the case and follow the pop-ups on your phone to get started. If you need to switch to another phone, tablet or computer, an easy pairing mode is activated by touching and holding both earbuds for three seconds while they&#39;re in the case.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0920a230-f922-11eb-a5f6-401450aa1f08" alt="Samsung Galaxy Buds 2" data-uuid="44b73e29-9aba-3689-9ef1-7248c052f2e8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>Inside, Samsung says two-way drivers offer &quot;crisp, clear high notes and a deep bass&quot; when it comes to music. The company also included ANC for the first time on its most affordable earbuds, which it claims can reduce background noise by up to 98 percent. There&#39;s an adjustable ambient sound mode as well, giving you the option to select from three different levels of environmental noise. This configurable ambient audio feature has become a staple on the Galaxy Buds line as we&#39;ve seen it on previous models.&nbsp;</p><p>Those changes are accessible inside the Galaxy Wearable app on Samsung and Android devices. There&#39;s also a Galaxy Buds app for Windows on PCs. Like before, this software allows you to see battery levels, choose an audio preset, adjust ambient sound and reconfigure the long press touch controls. Plus, a handy Find My Earbuds tool can help you locate a misplaced bud and a fit test will ensure you&#39;re getting the best seal for audio quality and ANC performance. If you also have a Galaxy Watch 4, a new Buds Controller feature allows you to toggle between ambient sound and active noise cancellation alongside battery level info and an option for disabling touch controls — all right on your wrist.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="504d89b3-7966-4538-9f93-cbbfb50d71a8"/><p>As always, Samsung is making big promises about call quality on the Galaxy Buds 2. The company says the combination of machine learning, a three-mic setup per earbud (two beamforming) and a voice pickup unit (VPU) &quot;maximizes call clarity in all conditions.&quot; This is something we&#39;ll have to test the merits of ourselves as claims of pristine call quality can vary widely from the real-world results.&nbsp;</p><p>Samsung says the Galaxy Buds 2 will last up to five hours with ANC on and up to 7.5 hours with noise cancellation turned off. The case holds three additional charges and can power up wirelessly via Qi-certified accessories.

We even saw previews of what it would look like. But that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s nothing left to learn about Samsung&#39;s latest smartwatches. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch Classic 4" href="https://fave.co/3Az958F">Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch Classic 4</a>, which launched today, feature a new 3-in-1 sensor, sharper screens and can even perform body fat scans. At a demo event in New York, I was able to check them both out and see what Wear OS on a Galaxy watch looks like.</p><p>Before we get too far ahead though, it’s worth noting that Samsung’s getting rid of the “Active” branding from its existing lineup — the Watch 4 is the spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-price-release-date.html">the Watch Active 2</a> (there wasn’t an Active 3). Meanwhile, it’s adding the “Classic” moniker to the previous “regular” Watch line, which the Watch 4 Classic is now the latest member of. Yep, not confusing at all.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><strong>The new Wear OS on Samsung is basically Tizen</strong></p><p>Setting aside the frustrating rebranding, Tizen fans have nothing to worry about with the new OS on the Watch 4s. There’s barely any difference. The main change I noticed is that instead of All Apps being one of the pages that you come across when swiping sideways through the watch, you can now access them by pulling up from the home screen. Otherwise, you can still swipe horizontally to scroll through widgets and cards like Weather, Exercise, Heart Rate and Stress, while quick settings are above the home screen.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/09a28770-fa56-11eb-9af7-5294f8c5d5c1" alt="A black Galaxy Watch 4 Classic with a rotating bezel." data-uuid="4bb05c1c-97d8-375a-882d-2aa1818b40c8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>This similarity to Tizen is something Samsung and Google are aware of. A Google spokesperson told Engadget that Wear OS 3 lets device makers add customized user experiences on top of the platform, like picking specific apps and services to be the default options. Though the two companies collaborated to “bring together the best of Wear OS and Tizen into one unified platform,” it’s becoming evident that smartwatch makers will still bring distinct identities to their devices.</p><p>To distinguish between different versions of Wear OS, there will be unique branding as well. For example, the Galaxy Watch 4 series is running “Wear OS powered by Samsung.”</p><p>It’s still unclear what Wear OS 3 will look like on other devices, but a Google spokesperson added that “while we expect many watches to have this experience in the future, there will start to be new consumer experiences introduced to the ecosystem.” Confusing? Potentially. But for now, it sounds like, while Google and Samsung did collaborate on a unified wearable platform, Galaxy smartwatches will run what amounts to a renamed version of Tizen with better third-party app support.&nbsp;</p><p>There are updated Google Maps, Messages, Pay and YouTube Music experiences, along with new apps and Tiles from Calm, MyFitnessPal, Strava, Sleep Cycle, Spotify and more. The Play Store is also available on the Galaxy Watch 4 for wrist-based discovery and installation, while Samsung’s One UI interface makes it easier to keep your phone and watch themes and notifications in sync.</p><p><strong>Minor cosmetic updates</strong></p><p>On the Watch 4 Classic, you’ll find Samsung’s hallmark rotating the bezel for spinning through widgets. Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-specs-bezel-ecg-trip-detection-140051465.html">the Galaxy Watch 3</a>, the mechanical wheel is lighter and less clunky than older models, while still getting into each notch with a satisfying click.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2d3b3b00-fa56-11eb-b5ff-8cd4cf4a80a2" alt="A black Galaxy Watch 4 on a stand next to a pair of olive Galaxy Buds 2. " data-uuid="c0d0cd1a-4f8b-3c16-841e-c3dd2562f849"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The larger variants of both the Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic feature sharper 450 x 450 displays, while remaining basically the same size as before. The Classic now comes in 42mm and 46mm options versus <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-3-review-specs-bezel-ecg-trip-detection-140051465.html">41mm and 45mm before</a>, and the regular or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-price-release-date.html">Active models</a> are still available in 40mm and 44mm. Also, Samsung is offering the Classic style in black, silver or green, and the standard edition in black, silver or pink.</p><p>In person, the black and silver Watch 4s looked like green and white, respectively, though that might have something to do with the warm lighting in our demo area. And though they have bigger faces than I like, the Watch 4 felt comfortable on my wrist — so much so that I forgot I was wearing one and almost walked out of our briefing with it on. Meanwhile, the Watch 4 Classic, which weighs 46.5 grams (or 52 grams in the 46mm size), felt heavier and more noticeable.</p><p><strong>A new sensor and processor</strong></p><p>Hardware improvements to the Watch 4 series don’t end at aesthetics. The biggest change this year is what Samsung is calling a new 3-in-1 BioActive sensor. The three here refers to optical heart rate, electrical heart rate and Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA). In addition to a smaller design that uses one chip to run the trio of sensors, this also enables a new feature: Body Composition measurement.</p><p>I’m super excited for this new service, since I like the additional insight that my body fat percentage brings to my understanding of my overall health. BMI is only one facet of your general fitness (and not a great one at that), and having a convenient way to get a body fat scan is something I’ve been looking for. I’ve been using Amazon’s camera-based tool in its Halo app to get a reading every month (the most accurate method would be to visit a doctor for a full <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/sportsmedicine/resources/dxa-info.html">DXA scan</a>, but I’ve yet to take one).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/48855080-fa56-11eb-bdcf-2799e44d9b8a" alt="The underside of two black Galaxy Watch 4s." data-uuid="e8004197-1796-348f-9dd1-dd03c9350db9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Mat Smith / Engadget</div></figure><p>I used the preview units of the Galaxy Watch 4 and Watch 4 Classic to take two separate readings of my body composition. It was surprisingly easy. All I had to do was fill in my gender, height and weight, then hold my middle and ring fingers against the two buttons on the watch for about 15 seconds. Both times, the smartwatches gave me a result of 30.8 percent, which is a little higher than what I usually get from Amazon’s app, but not too far off.</p><p>Other improvements to health-tracking include new snoring detection via a compatible smartphone, more accurate sleep-logging and faster auto-detection of workouts. Overnight, too, the Watch 4s will measure your blood oxygen level. Of course, I couldn’t test the sleep-related features at our brief preview session.</p><p>The Watch 4 series are also the first Galaxy Watches to sport 5nm processors, with a 20 percent faster CPU, 50 percent more RAM (16GB) and a GPU that’s 10 times speedier than the previous generation, according to Samsung. From my limited experience with them, the Watch 4s certainly felt fast, but I’d need more time in the real world to know how they hold up against the likes of Apple and Fitbit.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/65dac660-fa56-11eb-9f9f-b9bb53d0ca3c" alt="A black Galaxy Watch 4 Classic on a stand" data-uuid="99bf04bb-8755-3908-a6fb-3707766a120a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Samsung also promises up to 40 hours of battery life on the Galaxy Watch 4 series, though versions with LTE will likely have shorter runtimes. When you run out of juice, you should be able to get up to 10 hours of power in 30 minutes, too.</p><p>Along with the sleep-tracking features and overall performance improvements, battery life is another thing I look forward to testing on the Galaxy Watch 4 when we receive review units. The wearables go on sale on August 27th, though you can pre-order them today, with the smaller Watch 4 starting at $250 and the Watch 4 Classic costing $100 more.&nbsp;</p><p>While I’m stoked about the body composition measurement feature, I’m not yet convinced that the new Galaxy Watches with Wear OS powered by Samsung can take on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html">Apple’s watchOS</a>. But, at least based on my early impressions, Samsung continues to have the best smartwatch for Android users, even if that’s not a very high bar.</p><p><em>Follow all of the news from Samsung&#39;s Galaxy Unpacked event </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/galaxy%20unpacked%20foldables"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">21c522eb-22cf-432d-8d90-b770bd09c863</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 14:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628692535</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T14:35:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1fb67ef0-fa55-11eb-bfff-a5413d00e762" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1fb67ef0-fa55-11eb-bfff-a5413d00e762" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A pink Galaxy Watch 4 on a wrist]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Galaxy Watch 4]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[‘Journey to the Savage Planet’ developers reform after Google shut them down]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The employees of Typhoon Studios, the developer behind <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-journey-to-the-savage-planet-review.html"><em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em></a>, are reforming under the name Raccoon Logic. In an announcement, the team says that they are “to boldly go back to where they were before,” Google’s doomed acquisition of the company. Raccoon Logic has also revealed that the team has reacquired the rights to <em>Savage Planet</em>, enabling them to “hit the ground running on new adventures in the action adventure space.”</p><p>Typhoon was founded in 2017 by a group of Montreal-based game executives, including <em>Far Cry 4</em> director <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-10-23-google-distances-itself-from-stadia-creative-director-alex-hutchinson">Alex Hutchinson</a> and <em>Arkham Knight</em> executive producer Reid Schneider. Their first title was <em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em>, a satirical sci-fi game for PC, PS4, Xbox One and Switch first released January 2020.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In 2019, Typhoon was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-19-google-buys-typhoon-studios.html">acquired by Google</a> as part of its push to acquire <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jade-raymond-sony-playstation-haven-stadia-163828958.html">first-party content</a> for its nascent Stadia streaming service. Sadly, in early 2021, Google’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-studios-closure-173055505.html">notoriously impatient</a> leadership decided to change strategy, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-game-studios-shut-down-montreal-los-angeles-201811811.html">closing its first party games</a> division and firing the employees.</p><p>That decision would, in the short term, prove problematic, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-28-journey-to-the-savage-planet-review.html"><em>Journey to the Savage Planet</em></a> experienced some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-journey-to-the-savage-planet-bug-typhoon-studios-155002388.html">game-breaking bugs</a> that Google had to race to work out how to fix. And left the future of both the Savage Planet franchise and the careers of those Typhoon staffers in the balance.</p><p>In a statement, Raccoon Logic says that it has received a “pivotal investment” from Tencent which will bankroll its as-yet unannounced debut project. Alex Hutchinson says that Tencent’s backing is a “huge boost, meaning we can do significant work on our own before we start talking to publishers.” Reid Schneider, meanwhile, thanks 505 Games, which published <em>Savage Planet</em>, and added that he’s planning to “build upon the Journey to the <em>Savage Planet</em> franchise in the future.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/raccoon-logic-typhoon-studios-journey-to-the-savage-planet-133526495.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ba7f8676-9532-466a-990a-d43c676dc1aa</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 13:35:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628688459</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T13:27:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/57499f90-faa6-11eb-95af-c79ab825a00f" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/57499f90-faa6-11eb-95af-c79ab825a00f" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[‘Journey to the Savage Planet’ developers reform after Google shut them down]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The hacker behind a giant cryptocurrency heist is returning stolen funds]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Someone just perpetrated one of the largest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-27-coincheck-hack.html">cryptocurrency heists</a> known to date... and appears to be having second thoughts. <a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/114189/poly-hack-attacker-return-funds-id-slowmist"><em>The Block</em></a> and <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/11/cryptocurrency-theft-hackers-steal-600-million-in-poly-network-hack.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> report that a hacker stole about $611 million in Ethereum, Shiba Inu and other digital currencies from the decentralized Poly Network finance platform on August 10th by exploiting a vulnerability. Less than a day later, however, the intruder sent a token indicating they were &quot;ready to surrender&quot; and started <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1425423585665974276">returning</a> millions in funds.</p><p>It&#39;s not completely clear what prompted the change of heart, but the hacker may have been caught. <a href="https://share.api.weibo.cn/share/242725121.html?weibo_id=4668781562960148">Slowmist</a> and other security researchers reportedly tracked down identifying info, including email, an IP address and the Chinese cryptocurrency exchange the perpetrator used.

If there&#39;s any consolation, it&#39;s that the very technology exploited during the attack also made it difficult to profit from that attack.

That’s not to say the company has been idle. Far from it, in fact, but macOS users haven’t had a significant refresh to look forward to until now. Following early access previews on <a href="https://blog.1password.com/welcoming-linux-to-the-1password-family/">Linux</a> and <a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-windows-is-now-in-early-access/">Windows</a>, you can now try <a href="https://blog.1password.com/1password-8-for-mac-is-now-in-early-access/">1Password 8</a>, the latest version of the company’s desktop app, on Mac. The update brings with it a host of improvements to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-26-the-best-password-managers-compared.html">password manager</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>One of the first things you’ll notice is how categories have moved from the sidebar to a dropdown menu you can access from below the search bar. 1Password co-founder David Teare told Engadget that’s a decision the company made to highlight different accounts and vaults without forcing users to access a separate mode.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>A goal the developer set out for itself when it started work on 1Password 8 was to make the app better at highlighting all the ways you can share different vaults and login credentials between family members and co-workers. You’ll see that approach reflected throughout the app, starting with when you first open it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b434e040-f9f5-11eb-9fed-a5ee7a3d0675" alt="1Password move item" data-uuid="942704d9-d47a-3944-865b-8ad4a5718ea7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">1Password</div></figure><p>The lock screen now includes icons that display what accounts you will open. Moreover, once you’re in the main interface, you’ll see more contextual information throughout. For example, when you’re about to move a login, a pop-up window will appear to tell you who will gain access to that information as a result.</p><p>With the emphasis on sharing, 1Password is doubling down on paid memberships. While the writing has been on the wall for a while, 1Password 8 won&#39;t allow you to sync your accounts and vaults over Dropbox, iCloud or any other services aside from 1Password. According to Teare, the company decided to discontinue support for third-party syncing for a handful of reasons. “It’s hard to do sharing using a platform for syncing that doesn’t have a concept of other users,” he said.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5ddf6f80-f9f5-11eb-bfd7-fc5eab4510c0" alt="1Password 8 Watchtower dashboard" data-uuid="40f9e13c-787b-3e78-88b4-3fe8ac668d58"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">1Password</div></figure><p>One of the other goals 1Password set for itself with this new app was to keep things familiar. However, there are areas where the company experimented. It’s most apparent in the new Watchtower view. That section of the software will still warn you if you have weak, reused and compromised passwords, but will do so using a new dashboard view that’s similar to how competitors like Dashlane and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lastpass-security-dashboard-dark-web-monitoring-130006738.html">LastPass</a> present the information in their products. Teare said 1Password debated making Watchtower the first screen you see after opening 1Password 8 but ultimately decided that was “too big of a jump for one release.” However, he noted the updated Watchtower represents a new direction for 1Password, one where the company has the capabilities to allow its designers to tweak things more freely.</p><p>In a way, that’s the unifying theme of 1Password 8. It’s a significant milestone for 1Password not because of the new features involved but due to the work the company did behind the scenes to put systems in place for future releases. “With 1Password 8, we really wanted to tie everything together,” Teare said. Previously, the company had separate teams working on its different apps, with little in the way of shared code and resources between them. To help them work together, 1Password built a common code base using Rust, a programming language Teare said allowed the company to create a more cohesive experience across its apps while still catering to what makes each operating system different.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8447e4e0-f9f5-11eb-9bf5-20531b856c92" alt="1Password safari inline" data-uuid="482d3317-b38f-33ed-be52-fe40e6ad5767"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">1Password</div></figure><p>The way 1Password 8 works in conjunction with Safari is one example of that. You’ll now see the browser extension open inline with the username and password field on a website. If you have the app configured to handle two-factor authentication requests for you, it will also automatically fill that field once you get to it.</p><p>Once it&#39;s done testing the app, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:1Password" href="https://fave.co/3s6dIT2">1Password</a> expects to release 1Password 8 for Mac and Windows later this year. According to Teare, the company also plans to bring the improved experience to Android, iPhone and iPad users &quot;in the near future.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/1-password-8-mac-early-access-120012791.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0e6da932-d8a1-42a5-addf-70e398ebb829</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 11 Aug 2021 12:00:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628683611</ingested><modified>2021-08-11T12:07:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1aaa94f0-f9f6-11eb-9f73-13b7571066ca" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1aaa94f0-f9f6-11eb-9f73-13b7571066ca" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[1Password]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[1Password hero]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[1Password hero]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AirPods will link with an Apple ID in iOS 15 to enable Find My support]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ve known for a while that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-find-my-network-tracking-upgrades-032304589.html">iOS 15</a> will grant succor to all of those who have lost, and lamented, their AirPods.

Even if they’re not connected to your phone, you should still be able to find them on the map via the Find My network. Unfortunately, it does look that, despite being tied to your Apple ID, the relevant AirPods will not have an activation lock attached to them.

Notably, the patch that hides the camera has the same 400ppi density as the rest of the panel, albeit with smaller pixels and transparent circuitry. In-screen cameras usually offer sub-par photos and often stand out from the rest of the smartphone screen, due to reduced pixel density.

The update is designed to protect its users, particularly creators and public features, from seeing harassing, racist, homophobic and sexist content in comments and DM requests.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Limits feature, available starting today, will allow all users to hide comments and DM requests from users who either don&#39;t follow them or only recently started following them.  On top of that, the app will issue &quot;an even stronger warning&quot; and halt posting immediately if someone tries to publish an offensive content — rather than waiting for a repeat offense as before.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;Creators also tell us they don’t want to switch off comments and messages completely; they still want to hear from their community and build those relationships,&quot; said Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-new-ways-to-protect-our-community-from-abuse">blog post</a>. &quot;Limits allows you to hear from your long-standing followers, while limiting contact from people who might only be coming to your account to target you.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Instagram said that it developed the features following racist abuse directed at UK footballers in their direct messages. &quot;Our research shows that a lot of negativity towards public figures comes from people who don’t actually follow them, or who have only recently followed them, and who simply pile on in the moment,&quot; said Mosseri.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We saw this after the recent Euro 2020 final, which resulted in a significant — and unacceptable — spike in racist abuse towards players.</p></blockquote><p>The other new feature, Hidden Words, allows users to filter abusive messages in DM requests. If a request contains any filter word you&#39;ve chosen, it&#39;s automatically placed in a hidden folder that you can choose to never open — though it&#39;s not completely deleted.</p><p>The update, available starting today, arrives after Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-instagram-limit-targeted-ads-teens-130055774.html">announced</a> that it would make Instagram safer and more private for teens. Changes introduced last month include automatically making accounts private for teens under 16, limiting the ability of advertisers to target personal information like &quot;interests&quot; and using AI to detect a users&#39; age.&nbsp;</p><p>The changes also come as Facebook explores creating a version of Instagram for kids under 13.

With the touch of a button, the Audi Skysphere&#39;s entire front end can extend or retract 9.8-inches (and drop 0.4 inches).&nbsp;</p><p>The Skysphere is meant to show Audi&#39;s design chops as well as its technical prowess. It took inspiration from the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/1937-horch-853-wins-pebble-beach-concours-delegance-1783/">1931 Horch 853,</a> a long, low roadster with a pushed-back cabin and rear-wheel drive. The modern concept retains those primary features, in spades, with the long snout and low, laid-back cockpit giving it a mild resemblance to rear-drive GTs like the Ferrari 812 Superfast.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6dd1d4f0-fa5e-11eb-8fdb-617f0ff4f04c" alt="Audi&#39;s Skysphere concept EV roadster can transform into a grand tourer" data-uuid="e7914322-53f0-37c2-903c-7167e9403d62"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Audi</div></figure><p>In place of the straight-8 gas guzzler on the Horch, the concept car has a 623-horsepower electric motor and an 80-kWh battery, with much of it behind the rear bulkhead. That makes for a Porsche 911-like rear weight bias of 60-40, meaning it would be easy to get the Skysphere sideways if it was ever built. It also delivers 553 foot-pounds of torque, enough to take it to 60 MPH in around 4 seconds. At the same time, it will go around 310 miles on the Euro WLPT cycle, or less in EPA terms.&nbsp;</p><p>The interior is meant to evoke 1930s Art Deco architecture (matching the period of the Horch), with modern electronic conveniences. It has a full dashboard screen like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-27-honda-e-first-drive.html">Honda E</a>, along with large touchscreens at the armrest locations. The sharply angled, minimalist interior is designed for a Level 4 autonomous operation, so you can relax in GT mode and take control when you want to have some roadster-powered fun.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/91490be0-fa60-11eb-bdb7-501418ca5815" alt="Audi Skysphere" data-uuid="165bb2f1-aa61-3976-b485-fbe6330e2d2c"><figcaption>Roadster sport mode</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Audi</div></figure><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3a17740-fa60-11eb-bf7f-8e3e44f07deb" alt="Audi Skysphere" data-uuid="2a9ad6d9-e0cd-319d-806c-a0fefb95b532"><figcaption>Grander tourer (GT) mode</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Audi</div></figure><p>The most unique (though perhaps highly unrealistic) feature of the Skysphere is the variable wheelbase (above). Electric motors drive a telescoping structure that takes it from a long-wheelbase grand touring EV to a considerably shorter and lower roadster. It also uses active aerodynamics that are closed in GT mode and open in roadster form. When activated, they would duct air under the car for extra downforce.</p><p>The interior also transforms, pushing the steering wheel and pedals forward and the passenger seat rearward in roadster mode, while the dash moves forward to become a more driver-centric instrument panel.
