The first-person multiplayer shooter will pit teams of six characters (or Defiants) against each other across several game modes. There’s a focus on gunplay, though you’ll also be able to harness traits, abilities and “ultras” — which seem similar to ultimates in other games — based on the faction you’re using.</p><div id="629855497ccb413e8fa9ad3cc76d53c9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IB0f39NgAkg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p><em>XDefiant</em> is a bit of a crossover between Ubisoft’s various Clancy franchises. The initial set of factions include the Wolves (inspired by Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon), Echelon (Splinter Cell) and the Outcasts and Cleaners (The Division). More Defiants will be added to the game later, and will draw from a variety of characters and abilities “from the Tom Clancy universe … and beyond,” Ubisoft said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Ubisoft San Francisco is developing <em>XDefant</em>, which the creative leads said features “fast-paced firefights meet punk rock moshpits.” You can customize your Defiant’s loadout (including a primary and secondary weapons, attachments and device). You’ll be able to modify your setup when you respawn to help you adjust to what’s happening in a match. It sounds like there will be ways for both casual and competitive players to get the most out of the game too.</p><div id="6a825db2aade4282ac12a3c2a3e16603"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fpM6cLrCs8I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>There are clear echoes of <em>Overwatch</em> and <em>Valorant</em> here, with plenty Clancyverse flavor thrown in. Executive producer Mark Rubin previously worked on Infinity Ward’s Call of Duty games, and there’s some obvious DNA from that franchise in <em>XDefiant</em> as well.</p><p><em>XDefiant</em> is coming to Xbox One, PlayStation, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC, Google Stadia, Amazon Luna and Ubisoft Connect with full cross-play expected at the outset. The game’s still fairly early in development, but Ubisoft’s already inviting the public to try it. The first public PC test starts on August 5th, and you can sign up through the <a href="http://www.playxdefiant.com"><em>XDefiant </em>website</a> for a chance to take part.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ubisoft-tom-clancys-xdefiant-first-person-shooter-free-205135328.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8817d9ea-61b4-4254-9a1c-0b716b629254</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 20:51:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626727898</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T20:52:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95a80430-e8d0-11eb-bbbd-44701f3e697d" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/95a80430-e8d0-11eb-bbbd-44701f3e697d" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tom Clancy's XDefiant]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tom Clancy's XDefiant]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple rolls out iOS 14.7 with MagSafe Battery Pack support for iPhone 12]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Starting today, everyone with a compatible iPhone can update their device to iOS 14.7.

It also caused a lot of confusion over what would happen to the Android TV operating system, which powers hundreds of models of streaming sticks, TV sets and more. Those older devices didn&#39;t get the new Google TV interface, but the company did begin to roll out some updates that made Android TV look more similar to the new layout, including a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-tv-interface-discover-tab-170002365.html">refreshed appearance and a Discover tab</a>. Today, Google is adding new tools to Android TV to make it feel more like Google TV: Watchlist, recommendation tuning and detail pages.</p><p>With this update, you can now add titles to your watchlist across the Android TV system, either by long-pressing on your selection and hitting &quot;Add to Watchlist&quot; or pressing the Watchlist option in the show&#39;s detail page. You can also add to the list from your phone or laptop via Google Search or in the TV app. Your saved items will appear in a row on the Discover tab.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company also tweaked the detail pages of each show by adding trailers that autoplay when you dive deeper into each title, similar to how services like Netflix are set up. You can turn these off in the Settings (under Home Screen in Device Preferences  by deactivating &quot;Enable video previews&quot;).&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e05d2a80-e6c5-11eb-bfba-ac66682cbbf0" style="height:527;width:937;" alt="An image showing the new Android TV Tune Your Recommendations feature.

Additionally, there&#39;s a card in the Discover tab that says &quot;Improve your recommendations&quot; that will let you tune your preferences too, and you can choose between &quot;More like this&quot; or &quot;Less like this&quot; for each show. Once you&#39;re done, the system will update its suggestions for you in the Discover page.</p><p>Those already using a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chromecast-with-google-tv-review-163024220.html">Chromecast with Google TV</a> will find these features familiar, and those with older Android TV devices don&#39;t have to wait long to get them.

The network has <a href="https://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2021/07/19/cnn-to-debut-in-q1-2022/">unveiled</a> a CNN+ service that will offer a blend of live and on-demand shows that are &quot;separate and distinct&quot; from existing TV coverage. It will debut sometime in the first quarter of 2022. CNN hasn&#39;t narrowed down the price, but lead executive Andrew Morse told <em>Variety</em> in an <a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/inside-cnn-plus-a-first-look-at-the-new-streaming-service-exclusive-1235022517/">interview</a> that there wouldn&#39;t be an ad-supported tier at launch.</p><p>The centerpiece, as you&#39;d expect, will be the live material. CNN+ plans to offer eight to 12 hours of in-depth topical coverage and &quot;lifestyle&quot; material every day, with both veterans and newcomers at the helm. You&#39;ll also have chances to interact with anchors and experts in real-time discussions. This won&#39;t be a digital replica of CNN&#39;s usual news, then, but you may have reasons to tune in every day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The on-demand catalog unsurprisingly taps into CNN&#39;s existing collection, including shows like <em>Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown</em> and <em>United Shades of America</em>. There will be original shows and movies for the internet service, although CNN+ won&#39;t reveal those until later in 2021.</p><p>Officially, Morse said CNN+ wouldn&#39;t be bundled or otherwise tie into HBO Max despite the WarnerMedia connection. <em>Variety</em> sources, however, claimed there was a &quot;strong probability&quot; the service would be bundled with HBO Max and Discovery+ after <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-discovery-185439134.html">WarnerMedia and Discovery</a> finalize their merger.</p><p>Morse considered the CNN+ launch the largest the network has had since it started TV service in June 1980. It was also a chance to experiment with formats that blur distinctions between entertainment and news, the executive added.</p><p>The question, of course, is whether or not viewers will bite. CNN has had success with long-form content like the late Anthony Bourdain&#39;s shows, but it&#39;s not clear if people are ready to pay a monthly fee to see them. There&#39;s also the matter of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-please-stop-making-streaming-services.html">streaming service overload</a> — you might not be thrilled to subscribe to yet another offering just to be sure you catch everything CNN has to offer.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cnn-plus-streaming-service-launch-153702038.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b42bb611-7e1e-4966-a69a-6ca3ae388f30</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 15:37:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626709026</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T15:37:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/759e92b0-e8a0-11eb-afb7-a33033f781e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/759e92b0-e8a0-11eb-afb7-a33033f781e1" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CNN]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CNN+ streaming service]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[CNN+ streaming service]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Dish will pay AT&T $5 billion to serve its mobile customers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/at&amp;t"><ins>AT&amp;T</ins></a> is set to provide voice, data and messaging services to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/dish%20network"><ins>Dish</ins></a>&#39;s Boost Mobile, Ting and Republic Wireless customers for the next 10 years.

Prop up your phone, stand 10 feet away and you can walk through a familiar &quot;can you read this&quot; test that will gauge whether or not your glasses or contacts need updating.</p><p>The update isn&#39;t automatic. An eye doctor will review the results and give you a verdict within two days. If you&#39;re seeing well enough, you&#39;ll just need to pay $15 to renew your prescription. If you&#39;re either struggling or just aren&#39;t eligible to use the app (see below), Warby Parker will recommend that you get a thorough eye exam.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company is clear that this isn&#39;t a replacement for your eye doctor, and that you&#39;ll have to meet certain criteria beyond what we just mentioned. You have to be between 18 and 65 years old, with no existing eye health concerns and a single-vision distance prescription.</p><p>The approach relies on iOS&#39; Vision Framework to measure your distance from your iPhone and ensure that you&#39;re far enough away from a proper test. We&#39;ve asked Warby Parker about an Android version, although that might take a while given that it would need a rough equivalent to Vision Framework.</p><p>The motivations behind Virtual Vision Test are clear — on top of the renewal fee, this could lead to more people buying Warby Parker glasses and visiting the company&#39;s stores. Regardless, it could be very useful if you either can&#39;t make time to update your prescription or are still skittish about a visit while COVID-19 remains a concern.</p><div id="69f7067959d24c01ac391727048578e4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZC_xVikK5Zw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/warby-parker-virtual-vision-test-app-150052775.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6bf0d22d-d6a2-44d7-88b4-3f74ce2a8a6a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 15:00:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626707495</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T15:11:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Eye Care]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44b52200-e647-11eb-a99f-f4b5901a325f" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44b52200-e647-11eb-a99f-f4b5901a325f" width="1600" height="900" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Warby Parker]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Warby Parker Virtual Vision Test app for iPhone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Warby Parker Virtual Vision Test app for iPhone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The best gadgets for students under $50]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The little things can get you when you’re in college.

This cube has two USB-A ports, one 30W USB-C socket and three AC outlets, giving you more ways to keep your laptop, phone, tablet, headphones and other devices charged up. The five-foot cable is another perk as it prevents you from needing to hug the wall of the library in order to get things done.

Not only is it MFi-certified so it will work well with all Apple devices, but its length gives you much more flexibility than your standard three-foot cable does. It also supports fast charging if you have an appropriately powerful adapter to use it with. And for those who don’t have iPhones, Anker has a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:10-foot USB-C to C cable" href="https://amzn.to/3kypipV">10-foot USB-C to C cable</a> that should serve your handsets well, too.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Powerline II USB-C to Lightning cable at Amazon - $23" href="https://amzn.to/3yebGnj">Buy Powerline II USB-C to Lightning cable at Amazon - $23</a></p><h2>Apple AirTag</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3a077f50-df36-11eb-be9f-94070a5becd9" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>We’re all familiar with the panic that ensues when you realize you’ve misplaced your keys, wallet, phone or other valuables.

And, since it plugs into a wall outlet, they never have to remember to charge the Echo Dot like they would with a portable speaker.

The Chinese government&#39;s reported unwillingness to tackle these abuses is believed to hurt businesses, governments and infrastructure with &quot;billions of dollars&quot; in damage, the White House said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Accordingly, the Justice Department has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion">revealed</a> indictments of four MSS-affiliated Chinese men for allegedly conducting an extended hacking campaign meant to steal intellectual property and trade secrets, including health research. The initiative, which ran between 2011 and 2018, reportedly saw Ding Xiaoyang, Cheng Qingmin, Zhu Yunmin and Wu Shurong compromise comptuers worldwide to grab information ranging from autonomous vehicle technology and chemical formulas through to research on Ebola, AIDS and other diseases.</p><p>Biden&#39;s administration has already taken multiple actions in response to attacks, including &quot;proactive network defense actions&quot; like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fbi-hafnium-exchange-server-060721872.html">deleting backdoors</a> on compromised Exchange servers. It added private companies to its Unified Coordination Group to bolster its security incident response.

The collated info defines the “attraction value” of works of art, the researchers behind it told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-15/new-museum-technology-collects-data-on-viewing-habits"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>More broadly, the so-called ShareArt system is viewed as a way of boosting visitors to museums and galleries after a period of disruptive lockdowns. It could ultimately be used to give certain works more prominence in a collection. The data could also result in changes to the staging of a piece, including how paintings and sculptures are lit and placed in relation to one another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/613cf630-e88d-11eb-bf7f-3f30fed1abf1" alt="ENEA" data-uuid="753755db-78a1-306e-b295-b06e3167e725"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ENEA</div></figure><p>Though it dates back to 2016, museums like the Istituzione Bologna Musei have only recently begun rolling out the ShareArt system, notes <em>Bloomberg. </em>Thanks to the tech, researchers are already gaining surprising insights into the way we perceive and interact with art. They found that the average artwork observation time is just four to five seconds, with very few pieces capturing visitors&#39; attention for longer than 15 seconds. They add that if mask restrictions are dropped, the system will be able to track facial observations without compromising privacy, allowing the team to monitor cognitive reactions, too.&nbsp;</p><p>The ShareArt tool is the latest example of art melding with technology.

Whether you’re heading to a physical campus, taking classes online or a mix of both, a laptop is sure to be the control center for your studies.</p><p>And things have changed quite a bit over the last year or so. We’ve seen the introduction of Apple’s M1-powered MacBooks, while Microsoft recently unveiled Windows 11. With ARM-based computers teasing a future where the line between mobile and desktop computing is blurry, and Windows 11 working to bridge that gap by supporting Android apps, the laptop market is the most exciting it’s been in years.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But that might lead to more questions for shoppers. What should you look out for if you want an ARM-based PC? Will they run Windows 11 when that update is available? What are some key specs you should add to your must-have list this year? We compiled this guide to help you make the right choice, alongside a list of this year’s best laptops.</p><h2>What to look for in a laptop for school (and what to avoid)</h2><p>First: Windows on ARM still isn’t worth it. Snapdragon laptops may look and feel sleek, offer excellent battery life and built-in cellular radios, but they’re typically quite expensive, especially considering their limited app compatibility and finicky software. Apple’s M1 MacBooks, on the other hand, are great for almost everyone, barring those who need external GPUs, niche software or more than 16GB of RAM.</p><p>Over on the Intel side of things, almost every notebook released this year packs an 11th-generation Core processor. You’ll likely be able to find a cheaper version of a product with a 10th-gen chip, and it should still serve you well. And don’t forget about AMD’s Ryzen chips, either — they’re plenty powerful and no longer just for the bargain bin. If you&#39;re eagerly awaiting the arrival of Windows 11 devices, don&#39;t expect to see them before the semester begins. They&#39;re more likely to show up in the fall around Microsoft&#39;s usual hardware event in October.</p><p>Across the industry, companies have shifted to taller aspect ratios for their screens. Surface Laptops sport 3:2 panels, while many Dell and HP models offer 16:10. While the older 16:9 format is nice for watching videos, you’ll probably appreciate a taller format when you’re writing an essay. Some devices, like Dell’s XPS and Samsung’s Galaxy Book Pro, come with OLED panels, which will be nice for working with photos and videos. They usually cost more and take a toll on battery life, though, so you’ll need to weigh your priorities.</p><p>Fortunately, there’s a diverse selection of laptops around, so you should be able to find a suitable one regardless of your preferences. Here are our favorite notebooks for your return to schoolwork.</p><h2><strong>Apple MacBook Air M1</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/37c97a60-df2f-11eb-9ecb-f6cb740aca90" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>With its speedy performance, slim fanless design and excellent battery life, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3yxEaZi">MacBook Air M1</a> is a no-brainer for any Apple user. You’ll appreciate familiar features like a Retina display, comfortable keyboard and reliable trackpad. Plus, thanks to the company’s excellent Rosetta 2 emulator software, you won’t notice a huge performance difference when relying on Intel apps.</p><p>The big news, though, is that the ARM-based M1 allows the laptop to run iPhone and iPad apps too. While not every app will be available on macOS, the potential for more options on your desktop here is great. Now you just have to make sure you can keep the distractions at bay — which should be easy with the upcoming Focus modes on macOS Monterey, arriving in its final form later this year.</p><p>Unfortunately for those looking for more internal storage or something to run their bespoke video streaming setup, pre-fab <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air M1</a> laptops top out at 512GB storage (although you can pay extra for up to 2TB) while the Pro M1 only supports up to 16GB of RAM. The MacBook Pro M1 also lacks support for multiple monitors and an external GPU. Those with more demanding workflows might need to look to Windows or an Intel-powered MacBook to ensure app compatibility.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $999" href="https://amzn.to/3yxEaZi">Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $999</a></p><h2><strong>Dell XPS 13</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/53f7ae50-df2f-11eb-abef-05df19e0597f" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Dell’s XPS series has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-dell-xps-13-review-best-ultraportable.html">an Engadget favorite for years</a>. Despite a somewhat plain design that some might call “classic,” the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:XPS 13" href="https://bit.ly/3hkXvHq">XPS 13</a> still stands out for nailing pretty much everything that matters. Great performance? Check. Gorgeous screen? Yes. Comfortable keyboard? Yep. Throw in a long-lasting battery and a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-laptops-11th-gen-intel-cpus-130009045.html">the latest versions</a>, and you’ve got a powerful workhorse for all your classes (and more).</p><p>The company shifted to a 16:10 aspect ratio in 2020, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-xps-13-oled-130002911.html">recently added a 4K OLED option</a>. That means you’ll see greater contrast ratios and deeper blacks for maximum display goodness. The OLED configuration will cost you $300 more than the Full HD LCD option, but those who want the best viewing experience may not mind the premium. We also recommend you spend a little more and get at least the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Core i3 model with 8GB of RAM" href="https://bit.ly/3ywh0CO">Core i3 model with 8GB of RAM</a> instead of the meager 4GB that the base model offers.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Buy XPS 13 at Dell - $930" href="https://bit.ly/3hkXvHq">Buy XPS 13 at Dell - $930</a></p><h2><strong>Microsoft Surface Laptop 4</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6e0b8dc0-df2f-11eb-bbe7-52280094a124" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re looking for an excellent typing experience, look no further than the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Surface Laptop 4" href="https://fave.co/3ACpt9d">Surface Laptop 4</a>. Microsoft has been killing it with its recent Surface Laptops keyboards,  and this one is no exception. Though they’re not as deep and springy as ThinkPads, the buttons here are super responsive and offer ample travel. The roomy trackpad is solid, too.</p><p>Of course, it’s important that the Surface Laptop 4 deliver on everything else, or we wouldn’t recommend it. The 15-inch version <a href="https://www.engadget.com/surface-laptop-4-review-2021-bigger-better-ultraportable-133047360.html">that we tested</a> offered breezy performance, respectable battery life and a lovely 3:2 Pixelsense screen that supports Microsoft’s Surface Pen input. Though its design is a little staid, the Surface Laptop 4 still has a clean, professional look and a luxurious aluminum case that&#39;s sturdy enough to withstand being stuffed in your backpack on the regular. Plus, at 3.4 pounds, it won&#39;t burden your shoulders much.</p><p>The best thing about the Surface Laptop 4 is that the base model, which comes equipped with AMD’s Ryzen 5 processor and 8GB of RAM, starts at $1,000. That rivals the Dell XPS 13, making it a better buy for the value conscious; you get more screen, more power and more RAM for the money. Both the Surface and the XPS are great options, but the latter offers an OLED panel and thinner bezels that make it look more modern.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Surface Laptop 4 at Microsoft - $999" href="https://fave.co/3ACpt9d">Buy Surface Laptop 4 at Microsoft - $999</a></p><h2><strong>Samsung Galaxy Book Pro</strong></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8391a7b0-df2f-11eb-9fdf-c928301f5bd2" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>For those whose priority is a lightweight design, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Book Pro" href="https://fave.co/3wiui45">Galaxy Book Pro</a> series should be at the top of your list. At just 2.36 pounds for the clamshell and 3.06 pounds for the convertible model, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-15-inch-review-price-specs-130006444.html">15-inch Galaxy Book Pro</a> is one of the lightest 15-inch laptops around. It’s also super thin at 0.46 inches thick, and despite its compact size it manages to house three USB-C ports (one of them supporting Thunderbolt 4), a microSD card reader and a headphone jack.</p><p>It also packs an Intel Core i5 or i7 processor and at least 8GB of RAM, along with a 68Whr battery that delivers a similar runtime to the Dell XPS 13 and Surface Laptop 4. That’s particularly impressive given the Galaxy Book Pro has a Super AMOLED screen, which offers sumptuous image quality, high contrast ratio and deep blacks. Unfortunately, Samsung is still stuck on a 16:9 screen format, which will feel outdated in a year or two, but is hardly a dealbreaker.</p><p>The Galaxy Book Pro’s keyboard isn’t as comfortable as the Surface Laptop 4’s but it’s pleasant enough, and the trackpad is enormous. We’re more concerned about the odd webcam software that makes you look dark and splotchy, so if looking your best on video calls is of concern you might want to consider something else. Plus, the $1,100 base model comes with an Intel Core i5 chip, 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, making it a competitive offering against the Dell and Surface laptops. Awful camera aside, there’s plenty to love about the Galaxy Book Pro, especially for those looking to lighten their loads.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy Galaxy Book Pro at Samsung - $999" href="https://fave.co/3wiui45">Buy Galaxy Book Pro at Samsung - $999</a></p><h2>Acer Chromebook Spin 713</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f3731fb0-df2e-11eb-997e-b8fa781ff86f" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>If you’re considering saving a few hundred bucks by opting for Chrome OS, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Acer Chromebook Spin 713" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/jWzeYv">Acer Chromebook Spin 713</a> might be the right choice. Sure, there are cheaper Chromebooks out there, but it’s one of few machines with a 3:2 aspect ratio and has a utilitarian design that makes it perfect for butterfingers.</p><p>That price also gets you an 11th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, 8GB of RAM and sturdy 360-degree hinge so you can set it up in a variety of modes. The 13.5-inch screen is also more pixel-dense than most 1080p displays of the same size. Though the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review-183025946.html">Spin 713</a> only clocked about 8 hours on our battery test, that’s enough to get you through a work day. If $700 feels too expensive for a Chromebook, you could also wait till it inevitably goes on sale to save a bit more.

At the Game Developers Conference (GDC), it <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/07/19/geforce-rtx-arm-gdc/">unveiled</a> a technical demo with an RTX-powered MediaTek ARM processor running <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-13-wolfenstein-youngblood-e3-demo-video.html"><em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>NVIDIA showed off real time ray-traced reflections and DLSS on the game using an ARM-based platform for the first time. It also showed off a demo called <em>Bistro</em> (from Amazon&#39;s Lumberyard game engine) running real-time ray-tracing on ARM, with RTX direct illumination (RTXDI) and NVIDIA Optix AI-acceleration denoiser (NRD) features turned on. The demos ran on a MediaTek Kompanio 1200 ARM-based platform combined with a GeForce RTX 3060 GPU.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0c9dc21c047b40eeb74ffd727199a46f"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBfci5hYN1c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>NVIDIA made the tech work by porting several RTX SDKs to ARM devices. Those include deep learning super sampling (DLSS) to boost sharpness, RTX direct illumination, NVIDIA Optix AI-acceleration denoiser, the RTX memory utility (RTXMU) and RTX global illumination. NVIDIA said that the RTXDI, NRD and RTXMU SDKs for ARM with Linux are now available for developers, with RTXGI and DLSS coming soon.</p><p>Of course, you won&#39;t get to see any of this until manufacturers add RTX hardware to their ARM-based laptops, Chromebooks or other devices. Game manufacturers will also need to implement the tech for ARM-based games. However, both the <em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em> developer and game engine company seem bullish.&nbsp;</p><p>“RTX support for ARM and Linux opens up new opportunities for game developers to provide more immersive experiences on a wider variety of platforms,” said Unity&#39;s senior technical product manager Mathieu Muller. &quot;An iD Tech-based game running on an ARM CPU with ray tracing enabled is a significant step in a journey that will result in many more gaming platforms being available to all game developers,&quot; added Machinegames CTO Jim Kjellin.</p><p>Of course, NVIDIA&#39;s relationship with ARM is set to get a whole lot closer as it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-arm-acquisition-softbank-000846113.html">bought the company</a> last year for $40 billion.

Sound quality is noticeably better than previous AirPods models, thanks in part to a built-in amplifier and  Adaptive EQ, which automatically tunes low- and mid-range frequencies to your ears.

The H1 chip inside allows them to pair and switch easily between iPhones, iPads and Macs, so you can go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your Mac pretty seamlessly. We also like their hands-free Siri feature, which lets you call upon the voice assistant without tapping the earbuds.</p><p>AirPods Pro are one of the best pairs of earbuds you can get if you live in the Apple ecosystem — but there are other options, too.

Ocado — which competes with Amazon Fresh — has been forced to cancel orders for some customers after a robot collision sparked a fire at its warehouse in south-east London.

Nonetheless, the London Fire Brigade was called to the scene to deal with the blaze, the company added. In all, Ocado said the damage was limited to just 1 percent of its grid, adding that it would take a week for the facility to resume operations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The UK company&#39;s south-east London warehouse contains 3,000 robots that move at 13 feet per second when fetching grocery orders. Ocado also licenses its automation platform to others including <a href="https://www.ocadogroup.com/our-solutions/our-global-partners/kroger">Kroger</a> in the US, which recently deployed the system at its 375,000-square-foot customer fulfillment center in Monroe, Ohio.</p><p>Based on the proximity of the droids and the speedy nature of their task, it&#39;s a miracle more clashes haven&#39;t occurred. As detailed in a recent <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/26/world/ocado-supermarket-robot-warehouse-spc-intl/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a> report, the bots — described as &quot;washing machines on wheels&quot; — move within five millimeters of each other on a grid-like system to collect items. Ocado even told the news publication &quot;we basically play chicken with them: they go on a collision course only to divert at the last moment.&quot;</p><div id="7e3a207efa7542b88805857b854c7d67"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ssZ_8cqfBlE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ocado-robot-collision-fire-114027027.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8c5b5257-78e5-42ae-a0f4-8d7107c62147</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 11:40:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626694133</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T11:29:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7542a820-e881-11eb-beb7-052ca37e986b" width="1394" height="811" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/7542a820-e881-11eb-beb7-052ca37e986b" width="1394" height="811" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ocado]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ocado]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ocado]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Japan breaks the internet speed record]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientists at Japan&#39;s National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT) have <a href="https://www.engadget.com/japan-breaks-internet-speed-record-200136933.html">smashed the internet transfer record</a> by shifting data at 319Tbps, almost double the last speed test attempted in August 2020.

The move will allow Zoom to expand into call center technology worth up to $24 billion, diversifying its products once employees start returning to the office after the pandemic.&nbsp;</p><p>Five9 will become an operating unit of Zoom when the deal is closed, likely in the first half of 2022. &quot;We are continuously looking for ways to enhance our platform and the addition of Five9 is a natural fit that will deliver even more... value to our customers,” Zoom CEO Eric Yuan said in a <a href="https://investors.zoom.us/news-releases/news-release-details/zoom-acquire-five9">statement</a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0c177944b73d41fca343446a8ad80528"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Exciting news! 🎉 We have signed an agreement to acquire <a href="https://twitter.com/Five9?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Five9</a>.

Zoom notes that it was already a &quot;long-term&quot; customer of Five9 and said the partnership will give Five9&#39;s business clients access to Zoom products like the multi-platform <a href="https://zoom.us/zoom-phone-features">Zoom Phone</a> app.</p><p>The acquisition won&#39;t have much of an impact on consumers, as Five9 is largely a business-to-business company. However, Zoom&#39;s recent growth has been fueled in part by employees needing to work and communicate from home due to the pandemic. Once that crisis eases, Five9&#39;s contact center business will provide another revenue stream.</p><p>While most of its products are aimed at businesses, Zoom has also embraced the consumer side of things. Last year, the company released a new category of products called <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-for-home-130020632.html">Zoom for Home</a>, with both software and a line of hardware devices. While those products are aimed at employees working from home, they can also be used by consumers looking for a reliable video calling system.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zoom-acquires-contact-center-company-five9-for-14-7-billion-101956102.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">501cdc0f-b55a-4d1f-a2f5-3d59f704791c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 10:19:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626689998</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T10:20:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f45c3a0-e872-11eb-ab77-2979f026691a" width="674" height="400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4f45c3a0-e872-11eb-ab77-2979f026691a" width="674" height="400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zoom expands into call centers by acquiring Five9 for $14.7 billion]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zoom expands into call centers by acquiring Five9 for $14.7 billion]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tencent to buy British video game studio Sumo for $1.27 billion]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a busy year for gaming mergers, another deal has just been announced.

If <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s report was accurate, Nintendo would be making $40 more per Switch, a pretty notable boost. The OLED Switch replaces the LED display on the original Switch with a 7-inch 720p OLED screen and doubles the storage to 64GB, while adding an ethernet port and improved kickstand.&nbsp;</p><p>Multiple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-25-nintendo-could-launch-two-new-switch-consoles-this-year.html">reports</a> also pointed to the possibility of Nintendo launching another console, the Switch Pro, with higher-end components and NVIDIA&#39;s DLSS technology. However, Nintendo also shot down that rumor. &quot;We also want to clarify that we just announced that Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) will launch in October, 2021, and have no plans for launching any other model at this time,&quot; Nintendo added in a follow-up tweet.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-denies-it-will-squeeze-more-profit-from-oled-switch-sales-074528512.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8f686c0e-a56a-459e-8c08-feb69b365d45</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jul 2021 07:45:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626680730</ingested><modified>2021-07-19T07:45:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c4bcbce0-e860-11eb-9ed7-ea963f3d60f9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/c4bcbce0-e860-11eb-9ed7-ea963f3d60f9" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nintendo denies it will squeeze more profit from OLED Switch sales]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Nintendo denies it will squeeze more profit from OLED Switch sales]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Grimes, Will.i.am and Alanis Morrissette will judge an avatar singing TV show]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Are you more comfortable singing behind a virtual persona than you are on a real stage?

Canadian artists <a href="https://www.engadget.com/endel-grimes-ai-sleep-soundscape-android-release-110028557.html">Grimes</a> (pictured above) and Alanis Morrissette will join <a href="https://www.engadget.com/will-i-am-xupermask-face-mask-140005760.html">Will.i.am</a> and Nick Lachey in critiquing the music, while Emmy winner Rocsi Diaz will host the affair. <em>Alter Ego</em> debuts sometime in the fall.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s an unusual concept, but not necessarily a bad one. In theory, this could help budding talent overcome stage fright or self-esteem issues by using an avatar as a stand-in. It&#39;s certainly a fitting show for a tech-savvy artist like Grimes. It&#39;s just a question of whether or not audiences enjoy the concept.
