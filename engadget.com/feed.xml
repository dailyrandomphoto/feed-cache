Its latest release is no different, but that doesn’t make it any less exciting. It has announced an ITX PC case it’s calling the <a href="https://teenage.engineering/products/computer-1">Computer-1</a>. The company says it has been working on the design since 2014. “It’s not a ground-breaking PC case, but we like it, and use it every day,” TE says on its website. “Now we’d like to share it with you.”</p><p>The case is made from 1mm-thick powder-coated aluminum. Like TE’s recent synths, it comes in a build-it-yourself flat-pack design that involves bending some of the panels. “Think twice, bend once,” the company warns humorously. With chrome handles included, the case stands 322mm or about a foot tall. Width-wise, it measures 170mm or just over six inches wide. Inside, you have enough room for an SFX power supply, a dual-slot GPU that measures under 180mm long and a CPU cooler that’s about 120mm tall. It will be interesting to see what thermal performance is like on the Computer-1 since the side panels don’t feature a mesh design.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At $195, the Computer-1 is pricey, but about what you would expect to pay for an ITX case from a small company. You’ll find more affordable options in products like the <a href="https://www.coolermaster.com/catalog/cases/mini-itx/masterbox-nr200/">NR200</a> from Cooler Master, but you can easily spend as much as $200 or more on a <a href="https://www.dan-cases.com/dana4.php">Dan A4</a> or FormD T1. If you’re interested in the Computer-1, you may have to wait to get your hands on one. It’s currently sold out, but you can sign up to get a notification once it is available.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/teenage-engineering-itx-case-computer-1-214556959.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c4f9f26c-e00a-4525-800c-7b68faaf26cd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 21:45:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635456064</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T21:21:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/94236d40-3833-11ec-9aff-92d93fb45e19" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/94236d40-3833-11ec-9aff-92d93fb45e19" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Teenage Engineering]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Computer-1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Computer-1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon will spend billions of dollars to offset holiday shipping slowdown]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While Amazon had a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-q1-2021-210221698.html"><ins>huge revenue surge</ins></a> over the past year thanks to lockdown and the resulting rise of online shopping, the company’s <a href="https://ir.aboutamazon.com/files/doc_financials/2021/q3/Q3-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf">recent earnings report</a> shows that it might be slowing.

The company <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-reports-fourth-quarter-results/">just reported its results</a> for the quarter ending on September 30th, and Apple made 29 percent more revenue than a year ago — that&#39;s $83.4 billion, for those keeping track.</p><p>As usual, the iPhone led the way. iPhone sales made up almost 47 percent of Apple&#39;s total revenue, and iPhone revenue of $38.9 billion was up 47 percent year over year. But it&#39;s worth remembering that last year, the iPhone 12 series was delayed and didn&#39;t go on sale until October (or November, in the case of the iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max). This year, all four iPhone 13 models went on sale simultaneously, in mid-September. While that&#39;s only a few weeks of the quarter, it likely helped fuel that massive growth.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The iPad, too, had a strong quarter. While revenue of $8.25 billion makes it the smallest of Apple&#39;s five main product categories (iPhone, iPad, Mac, Services, and &quot;Wearables, Home, and Accessories&quot;) the iPad category grew 21 percent year over year. The Mac, on the other hand, was flat — revenue of $9.2 billion was only up two percent — but that was just enough for Apple to say it was a new all-time high for the Mac.&nbsp;</p><p>Apple&#39;s Services business has been growing steadily for years, so it&#39;s not surprising that this quarter&#39;s revenue of $18.3 billion was an all-time high, as well. But for the Mac, it&#39;s interesting to see it hit that high-water mark without <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">new MacBook Pro models</a> on the market to help move the needle. Now that the new MacBook Pro has been released, it&#39;ll be worth seeing how it affects Mac revenue overall next quarter.</p><p>The wearables, home, and accessories group also grew in strong but not spectacular fashion (up 12 percent). But just like with the Mac, next quarter could be huge for that segment — the new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">third-generation AirPods</a> just went on sale and it&#39;s easy to imagine those products making a big impact.&nbsp;</p><p>As usual, Apple is holding a call with investors at 5PM ET, and we&#39;ll be listening in to see if CEO Tim Cook has anything of note to share this quarter.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-q3-2021-earnings-financial-results-205158698.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ded55f6e-7909-4b1d-bb0d-d2f63c669f0c</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 20:51:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635454565</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T20:56:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/36816c80-3830-11ec-b77f-21eb4c39fec8" width="2000" height="1279" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/36816c80-3830-11ec-b77f-21eb4c39fec8" width="2000" height="1279" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mac revenue hit an all-time high last quarter, even without new MacBook Pros]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Mercedes cars will have optional Dolby Atmos audio starting in 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t have to buy a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lucid-air-ev-dolby-atmos-160018074.html">Lucid Air</a> if you want a car with more immersive Dolby Atmos.

You won&#39;t need a Facebook account to use its Quest headsets. That tidbit of information was nestled in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491">post</a> from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-cto-steps-down-2022-205051710.html">soon-to-be Meta</a> CTO Andrew &quot;Boz&quot; Bosworth detailing what the rebranding means for the company&#39;s various products.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;We’re working on new ways to log into Quest that won’t require a Facebook account, landing sometime next year,&quot; Bosworth said. &quot;This is one of our highest priority areas of work internally.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meta <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-facebook-account-policy-192552362.html">announced in August 2020</a> it would eventually require all Oculus owners to log into their devices with a Facebook account. At the time, the company said people it would start prompting people to merge their Oculus and Facebook accounts starting in October 2020. Under that plan, Oculus owners would have had until January 1st, 2023 to continue using their headsets without a Facebook account. After that point, Meta said the devices would continue working, but warned some games and apps would not.

When CEO Mark Zuckerberg first shared the news during the company&#39;s Connect event, it wasn&#39;t clear how broadly it planned to adopt the name across its product portfolio. But now we have a much better idea thanks to a Facebook post from incoming CTO <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491">Andrew &quot;Boz&quot; Bosworth</a>. For one, Meta is retiring the Oculus brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Beginning in early 2022, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Oculus Quest</a> will instead be known as the Meta Quest. Similarly, the Oculus App will be called Meta Quest App moving forward. According to Bosworth, the intention is &quot;to make clear&quot; to consumers Quest is a Meta product. &quot;We all have a strong attachment to the Oculus brand, and this was a very difficult decision to make,&quot; Bosworth said. &quot;While we’re retiring the name, I can assure you that the original Oculus vision remains deeply embedded in how Meta will continue to drive mass adoption for VR today.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As part of the rebranding, Meta is also backpedaling on its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-facebook-login-account-policy-backlash-160034955.html">unpopular decision</a> to require <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-facebook-account-policy-192552362.html">Facebook logins</a> to use Oculus headsets. Bosworth said the company is working on new ways to allow people to log into the platform, and that will roll out sometime next year. &quot;This is one of our highest priority areas of work internally,&quot; he added. Additionally, the name will filter to other products, including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-portals-go-170004952.html">Facebook Portal</a>.

Facebook Inc. is <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">changing the name</a> in order to distinguish its beleaguered social network, which has an increasingly poor reputation around the globe, from the company that is pinning <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-q3-2021-earnings-young-adults-metaverse-220703590.html">its future</a> on the promise of a “metaverse.”</p><p>&quot;Our brand is so tightly linked to one product that it can&#39;t possibly represent everything that we&#39;re doing today, let alone in the future,&quot; Zuckerberg said. &quot;From now on, we&#39;re going to be metaverse-first, not Facebook first.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zuckerberg announced the new name during a virtual (meta-virtual?) keynote for the company’s Connect event. Under its new arrangement, Facebook and its “family of apps” will be a division of the larger Meta company, which will still be led my Zuckerberg.</p><p>The restructuring bears some similarities to when Google restructured itself <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-10-02-google-alphabet-restructuring.html">into Alphabet</a>, the holding company that now operates Google, along with its “other bets” like DeepMind and Nest. Facebook previously said it plans to separate Facebook Reality Labs, its AR and VR group, from the rest of the company when reporting its financial performance. In a new statement it added that its&quot;corporate structure&quot; won&#39;t be changing. The company is also changing its stock ticker from FB to MVRS beginning <a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/facebook-new-name-meta">in December</a>.</p><p></p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/3a1c0f80-381c-11ec-afef-3151daef5589" alt="Facebook is now Meta." data-uuid="43ed939f-d36a-3825-b085-d01aec6c8d30"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p></p><p>The company is positioning the name as more reflective of its future ambitions to evolve from social network to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reportedly-changing-name-042958266.html">metaverse company</a>. Zuckerberg is still defining exactly what being a “metaverse company” means for its main platform and users, but augmented and virtual reality is central to the vision.  The company has already shown off an early version of one project, called Horizon Workrooms, that allows people to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">conduct meetings</a> in VR. The company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-connect-metaverse-zuckerberg-171507437.html">also previewed</a> new &quot;Horizon Home&quot; and &quot;Horizon Venues&quot; experiences. (All of the company&#39;s social VR products will fall under the larger &quot;Meta Horizon&quot; brand, according to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/boz/posts/10114026973983491">a post</a> from incoming CTO Andrew Bosworth.) And, earlier this month, the company announced plans <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-europe-jobs-metaverse-220103694.html">to hire</a> 10,000 new workers in Europe in order to build out its metaverse.</p><p>The name change also comes at one of the most precarious moments in the company’s history. The social network is reeling from the fallout of the<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-papers-release-120713316.html"> “Facebook Papers,”</a> a trove of internal documents collected by a former employee turned whistleblower. The documents have been the basis for a series of complaints to the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as the source of more than a dozen reports about the company’s failings to stem the tide of misinformation, hate speech and other harms caused by the platform.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a431d180-3820-11ec-b5bb-0f49daf10fed" alt="The thumb is no more." data-uuid="95ba7d67-dffc-3004-be7b-4a65644c105b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>The new name also means that the iconic Facebook &quot;thumbs up&quot; will no longer be the company&#39;s official logo or on the signage at its headquarters. (Incidentally, the role of &quot;likes&quot; and other reactions in enabling hate and anger on Facebook has been a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/25/technology/facebook-like-share-buttons.html">central narrative</a> of the Facebook Papers disclosures.) In a <a href="https://design.facebook.com/stories/designing-our-new-company-brand-meta/">blog post</a> about the design of the new name and logo, the company said the new logo was optimized for 3D experiences and &quot;designed to be experienced from different perspectives and interacted with.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s worth noting that the new name doesn&#39;t change anything for the main Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp services, which will be known by their existing names. But the services could get more metaverse-oriented experiences with time. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri <a href="https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/1453795920278003715">said</a> that users could expect &quot;a more immersive Instagram experience in the metaverse.&quot; Bosworth also notes that some &quot;relevant products and services&quot; would be rebranded as well, such as the Portal lineup, which will eventually take on &quot;Meta Portal&quot; branding. The company also plans to &quot;retire&quot; the Oculus name, with the VR products taking on the Meta identity.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">23b4053e-9791-4c4a-bbd8-086deafe9473</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 18:21:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635448426</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T19:13:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a3250eb0-381b-11ec-b8f1-ca2d404105f9" width="1554" height="863" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a3250eb0-381b-11ec-b8f1-ca2d404105f9" width="1554" height="863" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[fb meta]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[fb meta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Project Cambria' is a high-end VR headset designed for Facebook's metaverse]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is working on a new high-end VR headset codenamed Project Cambria.

It won&#39;t require VR or AR glasses (at least, not at first). And, most importantly, it&#39;s not something Facebook wants to keep to itself. Instead, as Mark Zuckerberg described to media ahead of today&#39;s Facebook Connect conference, the company is betting it&#39;ll be the next major computing platform after the rise of smartphones and the mobile web. Facebook is so confident, in fact, Zuckerberg announced that it&#39;s renaming itself to &quot;Meta.&quot;</p><p>After spending the last decade becoming obsessed with our phones and tablets — learning to stare down and scroll practically as a reflex — the Facebook founder thinks we&#39;ll be spending more time looking up at the 3D objects floating around us in the digital realm. Or maybe you&#39;ll be following a friend&#39;s avatar as they wander around your living room as a hologram. It&#39;s basically a digital world layered right on top of the real world, or an &quot;embodied internet&quot; as Zuckerberg describes.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Before he got into the weeds for his grand new vision, though, Zuckerberg also preempted criticism about looking into the future now, as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-papers-release-120713316.html">Facebook Papers paint the company </a>as a mismanaged behemoth that constantly prioritizes profit over safety. While acknowledging the seriousness of the issues the company is facing,  noting that it&#39;ll continue to focus on solving them with &quot;industry-leading&quot; investments, Zuckerberg  said:&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f4714630-380c-11ec-be1b-72b698ac97e3" alt="Oculus Quest 2" data-uuid="c0afc1f0-5415-3dba-a7c5-7f83f36e9e76"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>&quot;The reality is is that there&#39;s always going to be issues and for some people... they may have the view that there&#39;s never really a great time to focus on the future... From my perspective, I think that we&#39;re here to create things and we believe that we can do this and that technology can make things better. So we think it&#39;s important to to push forward.&quot;</p><p>Given the extent to which Facebook, and Zuckerberg in particular, have proven to be untrustworthy stewards of social technology, it&#39;s almost laughable that the company wants us to buy into its future. But, like the rise of photo sharing and group chat apps, Zuckerberg at least has a good sense of what&#39;s coming next. And for all of his talk of turning Facebook into a metaverse company, he&#39;s adamant that he doesn&#39;t want to build a metaverse that&#39;s entirely owned by Facebook. He doesn&#39;t think other companies will either. Like the mobile web, he thinks every major technology company will contribute something towards the metaverse. He&#39;s just hoping to make Facebook a pioneer.</p><p>&quot;Instead of looking at a screen, or today, how we look at the Internet, I think in the future you&#39;re going to be in the experiences, and I think that&#39;s just a qualitatively different experience,&quot; Zuckerberg said. It&#39;s not quite virtual reality as we think of it, and it&#39;s not just augmented reality. But ultimately, he sees the metaverse as something that&#39;ll help to deliver more presence for digital social experiences — the sense of being there, instead of just being trapped in a zoom window. And he expects there to be continuity across devices, so you&#39;ll be able to start chatting with friends on your phone and seamlessly join them as a hologram when you slip on AR glasses.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/1fb2bae0-380d-11ec-9fb7-d943e53347f6" alt="Facebook Horizon Home" data-uuid="8f7b5a69-28c9-33ff-aa83-1664db0bbf25"><figcaption>A simulated preview of Horizon Home.</figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>But, of course, the metaverse won&#39;t be built in a day. At Facebook Connect today, the company announced several ways it&#39;s moving towards making it more accessible. For one, Facebook will be transforming the Oculus Quest&#39;s Home interface into &quot;Horizon Home,&quot; a more fully featured environment where you can invite friends and hang out virtually. Eventually, you&#39;ll also be able to build and customize your home space. The Venues app is also becoming &quot;Horizon Venues,&quot; where it&#39;ll continue to serve as Facebook&#39;s prime spot for live virtual events. (The company also says NBA games are coming back to Venues in early November.)</p><p>The company is also making a major push for developers: its new Presence Platform offers through APIs that&#39;ll allow devs to make more inventive VR apps. The Insight SDK will let them take advantage of the Quest 2&#39;s cameras to bring the real world into VR; the Interaction SDK opens up the door for more hand-tracking interactions; and the Voice SDK will — you guessed it — let you use your words in more ways.</p><p>The Insight SDK, in particular, could reshape what Quest VR experiences could look like. It includes Spatial Anchors, which will let virtual objects persist across sessions in a space. So if you placed a VR pet bunny on your coffee table, it should always be there every time you logged into an app. Additionally, there&#39;s a Scene Understanding feature, which can help developers get a better sense of your physical space. A character talking to you in VR could, for example, wander around your living room without bumping into furniture.</p><div class="inline-emphasis"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/636b9d10-380d-11ec-b7fa-ba41df68fd38" style="height:812;width:374;" alt="Facebook Polar" data-uuid="812a27a4-cd60-392c-b8de-b2ba958f87f8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p></p></div><p>When it comes to augmented reality, Facebook also has plenty of upgrades in store for its Spark AR platform. For one, it&#39;s planning to launch an iOS app called Polar that&#39;ll let people design their own AR effects and objects without any coding. It&#39;s aimed at creators, who could use it to build unique 3D signage or makeup effects that their followers can apply. More experienced devs will also be able to create Geo-anchored objects, which are tied to specific locations in the real world, as well as AR effects that track your hands and body. They can also try out building group video chats for Messenger, something that&#39;ll eventually be supported in other apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Like HoloLens and HTC Vive, Facebook plans to make a bigger push into enterprises with Quest for Business. It&#39;s a way for employees to log into Quest 2 headsets with secure work accounts (it&#39;s probably not great for your boss to see how often you&#39;re playing <em>Beat Saber</em>, after all). Since they&#39;re meant for office environments, IT departments will also be able to manage work accounts, specific devices and integrate their own security features. The key is that it&#39;s all going to be accessible on consumer-grade Quest 2 headsets, Facebook won&#39;t have to make entirely new hardware for work environments.</p><section data-eng-breakout="60b0b0b3b0234adc9714b50aaf40a785" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd4463c0-00b3-11ec-a8fb-bb128f10ddf0" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms"></section><p>The company plans to take it slow with Quest for Business. It&#39;s currently being tested with a few companies now, and a wider beta is expected to come next year. At this point, Facebook isn&#39;t planning to officially roll it out to every company until 2023. Quest for Business will replace the previous <a href="https://business.oculus.com/">Oculus for Business program</a>, which required a special $799 Quest 2 headset.</p><p>Facebook already showed off one way remote meetings could be handled better with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html">Horizon Workrooms</a>, and that app is going to get better later this year with customizable workrooms. And when it comes to productivity, the company is also opening up the Oculus Store to 2D apps like Slack, Dropbox, Instagram and Facebook. You&#39;ll be able to dive into those apps right from your Horizon Home screen. It&#39;s convenient, but it&#39;s also a cheeky way to keep you from taking off your headset just to answer a Slack message.</p><p>Not everyone would want to spend a whole workday wearing a VR headset, but it&#39;s not hard to imagine how future AR glasses could let you dive into Slack and Office apps just about anywhere. They&#39;ll just be 2D projections floating around you, things that nobody else would be able to see. That may seem like science fiction today, but 15 years ago, so did the idea of having a touchscreen-enabled supercomputer in your pocket with blazing fast wireless internet.&nbsp;</p><p>As Zuckerberg sees it, the metaverse will ultimately lead to a more natural relationship with technology (while, of course, giving us another way to buy digital goods). &quot;It&#39;s not about you spending more time on screens,&quot; he told press before making a hasty retreat. &quot;It&#39;s about making the time we spend better and I think you know screens can&#39;t really convey the full sense of presence.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-connect-metaverse-zuckerberg-171507437.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e2ddde43-d0e2-4528-865f-cdb67d41e4d7</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 17:15:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635445316</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T18:22:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2d1e7811-380b-11ec-9f3d-ab62c22a5449" width="1996" height="871" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/2d1e7811-380b-11ec-9f3d-ab62c22a5449" width="1996" height="871" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Spark AR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Spark AR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google Fi will soon offer end-to-end encrypted calls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you’re a Google Fi subscriber, the next time you phone someone your call may be protected by end-to-end encryption.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh6-development-announcement-140038779.html">$2,500 GH6</a>, due to arrive later this year, has major upgrades like 4K 120p and even 5.7K video. The other is the model I’m reviewing today, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,700 GH5 II" href="https://fave.co/3oMoxtz">$1,700 GH5 II</a>.</p><p>As the name suggests, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-10-bit-60p-video-140057920.html">GH5 II</a> is more of a refresh, with the same 20-megapixel Micro Four Thirds sensor. However, it has an all-new processor that delivers significant improvements in speed, video quality and AI smarts. Best of all, it’s $300 less than the GH5 was at launch.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The big question is whether it’s worth getting this model, waiting for the GH6, or even purchasing an older GH5 that’s now <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-Mirrorless-Megapixel-DC-GH5-Accessories/dp/B079TC31FC/ref=sr_1_4?dchild=1&amp;keywords=panasonic+gh5&amp;qid=1633010814&amp;sr=8-4">steeply discounted</a>. To find out, I tested the GH5 II’s new features, video quality, autofocus and more — here’s what I found out.</p><h3>Body and handling</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0b3f2bd0-3730-11ec-9ffe-034a1b3053bd" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="35f45301-980c-3cb3-949d-ddd1cf4783b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>If you’re already familiar with the GH5, you’ll be very comfortable with the GH5 II — the bodies are nearly identical. That’s a good thing, because it still out-handles many newer cameras, thanks to the excellent grip and logical control positions.</p><p>There are a few key changes, though. While the rear display is a little smaller at 3 inches instead of 3.2 inches, it has slightly more resolution and is significantly brighter. That fixes one of the biggest issues with the GH5: its relatively dim display.</p><p>The electronic viewfinder (EVF) carries the same 3.68 million dot resolution and .76x magnification, but has double the refresh rate at 120Hz. That makes a noticeable difference in image quality; more so than a resolution bump in my opinion. However, it also drains the battery a touch faster.</p><p>Another nice improvement is the addition of USB-C PD compatibility that can charge the battery more quickly. And it comes with a more powerful DMW-BLK22 battery, the same one found in the company’s full-frame S5 camera. While it’s still CIPA-rated for 410 shots like the GH5, it delivers a few more minutes of video recording.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/316938a0-3730-11ec-8fbe-ec6d9268d555" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="17cd8e31-431c-397a-ba01-d4f14b7ced74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The GH5 II has better menus than the GH5, gaining those introduced on the GH5s. It’s a color coded, tabbed menu system with hints to find the option you’re looking for. It also has the info panel from Panasonic’s pro Varicam models (also available on the GH5s), that show important settings at a glance. Another feature for pro shooters is dual zebra controls that let you check two levels at once, like highlights and skin tones.</p><p>As with the GH5, the new model has dual UHS II card slots, but they now support the maximum V90 (300 MB/s) speeds. That’ll ensure stable capture if you’re using the new All-I 4K video settings at up to 400 Mbps, or let the buffer clear faster if you’re snapping photos.</p><h3>Video performance</h3><p>There are several subtle, but important changes to the video capabilities of the GH5. A key one is an update to the image stabilization system. It now delivers up to 6.5 EV of shake protection, up by 1.5 EV over the GH5. When working with compatible lenses and using the IS boost mode, it’s designed to provide more steady shots, even if you’re walking or moving.</p><p>No in-camera stabilization system is ever going to beat a gimbal. However, the GH5 II does a better job than most mirrorless cameras I’ve tried at smoothing out walking or running, provided you’re reasonably careful. More importantly, it makes handheld camera pans and other motion smoother than the GH5 does. If you need some extra stabilization, there’s an electronic mode that does help, though it crops in slightly.</p><p>Another key change is with the autofocus system. In general, continuous autofocus for video is faster and smoother than before, though you’ll still see a tiny bit of hunting or wobble that’s unavoidable with a contrast-detect-only AF system. As before, the system works better at higher frame rates when it has more information to work with.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/82b52430-3730-11ec-9fae-b3e7740ba060" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="cd30be5e-f983-3673-ac26-862eee30c01f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The GH5 II also brings some AI autofocus smarts that couldn’t be added via firmware to the GH5 because of its relatively old processor. It offers double the face and eye-tracking speeds, and can pick up focus when a face is tilted away from the camera. It can recognize heads and human bodies, making tracking more feasible if a person is turning or moving towards or away from the camera. It adds new animal tracking features that can handle most pets and some types of wildlife, as well.</p><p>With these features enabled, it’s easier to keep someone in focus if they or you are moving. Again, this works best at higher frame-rates, but overall, the improved focus hit rates make the camera more practical for vlogging or run-and-gun work, especially for solo operators. Animal tracking is also pretty useful, particularly if pets and/or kids are running around.</p><p>Is the GH5’s subject tracking as good as on Canon or especially Sony’s latest mirrorless cameras? No, because both of those brands use phase-detect systems that can nail focus directly without any wobble. Sony’s latest models, particularly the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a1-review-8k-mirrorless-camera-video-143023884.html">A1</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-a7s-iii-mirrorless-camera-review-140041536.html">A7S III</a>, also have uncannily fast tracking capabilities that Panasonic has yet to match. Still, the new model is a big step up from the GH5 and certainly good enough for many types of projects.</p><h3>Video quality</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ad4d3980-3730-11ec-aefb-a18108dccf82" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="883625b7-0d4f-3a48-adca-7b8907b1e6a5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>Video made the GH5 popular, as it was far ahead of the competition for the price when it first arrived. Five years on, it’s getting pretty old, though, so a new processor helped Panasonic boost the GH5 II’s specs in line with what it’s done on full-frame models like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-s5-full-frame-mirrorless-review-140006301.html">S5</a>.</p><p>To that end, the new model now offers 10-bit 4:2:0 4K and C4K (4,096 x 2,160) video at up to 60 fps, rather than just 8-bit video at 60p as before. That makes it better for slow-mo or high frame-rate video if you want to use log or HDR video settings. Like the GH5, it can also handle 6K 30p anamorphic (4,992 x 3,774) with 10-bit, 4:2:0 color settings. And where All-I capture was limited to 24/25 fps on the GH5, the GH II can now do it at up to 30 fps.</p><p>Though the GH5 II comes with VLog-L shooting out of the box, it&#39;s limited to 12 stops of dynamic range rather than 13 like Panasonic’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-mirrorless-camera-lumix-bgh1-163525921.html">BGH1 box camera</a> and other recent models. Panasonic also introduced two new video modes, Cinelike D2 and Cinelike V2, that let you shoot log-like video with less hassle. Those deliver slightly more saturated colors and improved skin tones than the original Cinelike D and V modes.</p><p>Like other newer models, the GH5 II shows a red frame around the screen while recording, along with aspect ratio guides and a TikTok-style portrait video mode.  With the same sensor, the GH5 II has pretty much the same readout speeds, so as before, rolling shutter is present but well controlled.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/62cf1860-3730-11ec-bdff-8ba32f7298ca" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="f4a10862-ffc3-3dcf-89d3-c6a23d2b33a8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The GH5 II can now capture video simultaneously to an external recorder over the HDMI port, unlike the GH5. However, it can’t capture RAW video like the S5, for instance. Hopefully, that and the limited VLog-L dynamic range will be addressed in future firmware updates.</p><p>With all those tweaks, the GH5 II delivers sharp video with high levels of color accuracy for demanding work. It handles skin tones well and colors are natural and accurate. Low-light shooting is not its strong point, though, due to the smaller sensor size. For that, you’d be better off with either the GH5s or one of Panasonic’s newer full-frame models.</p><p>The new video quality changes are subtle, but could be helpful for certain types of work. Overall, it delivers the video quality everyone liked from the GH5, plus a little more.</p><h3>Live Streaming</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/53ed5270-3731-11ec-bf7f-1cc652ccecd8" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="de71b920-c14b-392f-9191-857baebd917e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>A key new feature for the GH5 II is the ability to broadcast live on the web, either using WiFi or a USB-C. The latter will require a firmware update that essentially allows the GH5 II’s USB-C port to be used as a wired LAN connection, however.</p><p>You can either stream to a smartphone via WiFi using the Lumix Sync app, or stream directly over WiFi without the need for a PC or phone. The latter requires you to use the Lumix Network software for PC or Mac to write your streaming settings to an SD card. Since it uses the RTMP/RTMPS standard, it supports YouTube, Facebook and other services. Better still, it supports camera audio as well as video.</p><p>Live streaming does require a robust connection, however, as I struggled to maintain a livestream in the countryside with a 16 Mbps connection. You won’t want to use the maximum 1080p 60 fps settings unless you have internet speed well above 16 Mbps.</p><h3>Photos</h3><section data-eng-breakout="ccd8c65a80324179a12754d860d7fb81" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/73100e40-3731-11ec-bdb5-7d64568fbb8e" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers"></section><p>With the same sensor as the GH5, the GH5 II delivers much the same image quality and photo shooting specs, including 12 fps burst shooting speeds. Where it has improved, though, is in the autofocus features, particularly with tracking.</p><p>The G9 was always a better photo camera than the GH5, as it had a noticeably quicker autofocus system. However, the GH5 II’s new processor means faster AF calculations, so the hit rate with continuous burst shooting is higher. It can also do face and eye tracking more quickly, and as with video, can handle head and body tracking, too.</p><p>With those changes, I was able to get more burst action shots in focus than I could with the GH5, whether shooting people, dogs or horses. At the same time, it tends to nail exposure more accurately than the original model.</p><p>Image quality is largely along the same lines as video, with low-light capability that gets pretty noisy above ISO 3200 or so, but sharp, color-accurate photos in good light. As before, it’s best not to let your highlights get too blown out as they’re difficult to recover when shooting RAW.</p><h3>Wrap-up</h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/91c64ca0-3731-11ec-bedf-c47f454a2751" alt="Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers" data-uuid="e7abee3b-dd6b-3694-ac4d-4ff286aab26c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Steve Dent/Engadget</div></figure><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:GH5 II" href="https://fave.co/3oMoxtz">GH5 II</a> is a worthy upgrade to the original, bringing enough improvements and new technology to justify its existence. Given that the all-new GH6 model is coming soon as well, it’s clear that Panasonic is still committed to small sensor, video-centric mirrorless cameras.</p><p>Video has modestly improved, and it’s better for handheld shooting thanks to the improved stabilization. Autofocus is still a drawback but it’s faster and more reliable than before. It would be nice if it supported RAW external capture, but that’s probably not a dealbreaker for most users. It can handle stills reasonably well, though it’s not the camera’s strong point.</p><p>Other cameras have caught up with the GH5 II in terms of video performance, but most, like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/canon-r6-review-almost-perfect-140051632.html">Canon R6</a> (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$2,500" href="https://fave.co/3vRGFFX">$2,500</a>) and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nikons-latest-z-6-ii-firmware-unlocks-4-k-60-fps-recording-110552464.html">Nikon Z6 II</a> (<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$2,000" href="https://fave.co/32xdGsT">$2,000</a>) are more expensive. Fujifilm’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$1,700" href="https://fave.co/3sDfATK">$1,700</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/fujifilm-x-t4-mirrorless-camera-review-140024236.html">X-T4</a> is a better choice if you want a larger sensor and shoot a lot of photos, but it lacks the streaming capabilities. Its biggest rival may be the original GH5 that can now be found for $1,300, if you don’t need the video streaming or other features. In any case, the GH5 II is now the best Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera for video. At least until the GH6 comes along.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/panasonic-gh5-ii-review-speed-streaming-powers-164600927.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6e5cacee-5a87-4ea8-97fc-fccdd8fb90c4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 16:46:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635440779</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T17:06:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a2517240-372f-11ec-87bf-5e60fd7762ec" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a2517240-372f-11ec-87bf-5e60fd7762ec" width="1800" height="1012" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Steve Dent/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Panasonic GH5 II review: A vlogging classic gains speed and streaming powers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Activision Blizzard ends forced arbitration for harassment and discrimination claims]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following months of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blizzard-activision-walkout-184945869.html#"><ins>pressure from employees and workers</ins></a>, Activision Blizzard says it will no longer employ forced arbitration in sexual harassment and discrimination claims. CEO Bobby Kotick announced the policy change in a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211028005446/en/A-Letter-From-CEO-Bobby-Kotick-Regarding-Progress-and-Commitments-Made-at-Activision-Blizzard"><ins>letter to employees</ins></a> the company shared on Thursday. Kotick said the publisher will also implement a new company-wide zero-tolerance harassment policy. In the future, any employee who is found to have violated the rule will be fired immediately. Additionally, they’ll forfeit any future compensation, including equity awards.</p><p>“Our goal is to have the strictest harassment and non-retaliation policies of any employer, and we will continue to examine and tighten our standards to achieve this goal everywhere we do business,” Kotick said.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The executive outlined three other steps Activision Blizzard will take to create a safer and more diverse workplace. Over the next 10 years, it will invest $250 million in programs that create opportunities in tech and gaming for under-represented communities. Additionally, the company to plans to hire more women and non-binary people. According to Kotick, approximately 23 percent of all employees at Activision Blizzard identify as part of those groups. Its goal is to increase that number by 50 percent to more than one-third across the entire company within the next five years. Kotick also promised the company will share annual reports on progress it makes toward pay equity.</p><p>Separately, the executive said he has asked Activision Blizzard’s board of directors to reduce his total compensation to $62,500 per year until it feels like he has met the diversity and safety goals outlined above.</p><p>Today’s announcement sees Kotick and Activision Blizzard meeting many of the <a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1433466353726361603?s=20">demands</a> employees put before the company when they began protesting its actions in the wake of California’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html"><ins>sexual harassment lawsuit</ins></a>.

The second-gen <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nest Hub" href="https://fave.co/3jLXCN8">Nest Hub</a> is half off, bringing it down to $50, while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Nest Hub Max" href="https://fave.co/3pNUOCW">Nest Hub Max</a> is on sale for $180.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3mQeJzP" id="7a43bee84fbe4b2e8913ee5325e94733" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Audio at B&amp;H - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3jLXCN8" id="37c650f19deb4d89af1daa3dd3a16324" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub (2nd gen) at B&amp;H - $50</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3pNUOCW" id="5b6f6dc4f90a4e7a8be54350b07695ad" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Nest Hub Max at B&amp;H - $180</a><p>If you&#39;re an Android user or a Google Assistant fan, you can&#39;t go wrong with the Nest Audio as your main smart speaker. It earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-review-143012511.html">score of 87</a> from us and we considered it to be a steal at its normal $100 price point. Not only does it have solid sound quality on its own, but two paired together in stereo mode sound even better. We also like its minimalist design and how speedily the Google Assistant responds to commands.</p><p>Either of the Nest Hubs on sale would make great additions to your smart home, but which you choose will likely depend on how much you value affordability and sound quality. The second-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-review-sleep-tracking-radar-price-specs-130026942.html">Nest Hub</a> is a great deal at $50 because you&#39;re getting a faster device overall, much improved audio quality and new sleep tracking abilities. For the latter, if you put the Nest Hub next to your bed, it&#39;ll track how long you&#39;ve been asleep and even if you snore during the night. And regardless of where it sits in your home, the smart display can show video camera feeds from Nest Cams, so you can see who&#39;s at your front door without actually answering it.</p><p>As for the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-09-google-nest-hub-max-review.html">Nest Hub Max</a>, it&#39;s the better choice if you want a smart display that can also hold its own against some high-end speakers. It includes two front-facing tweeters and a rear-facing woofer and they work together to pump out strong, clear sound. It&#39;s not a replacement for a couple of Sonos speakers spread throughout your home, but it&#39;s one of the best options if you want one device that can be your main speaker and smart display.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-nest-audio-hits-new-low-of-60-at-bh-photo-150717380.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0dc978d5-0f49-4380-b519-6402f20fc86a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 15:07:17 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635442748</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T17:39:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/31e02730-9bbd-11eb-bfaa-c7494697b3e8" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/31e02730-9bbd-11eb-bfaa-c7494697b3e8" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Nest Audio smart speaker sitting on a wooden tablet next to a green plant, against a blue wall.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Nest Audio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple TV+ is coming to Comcast devices]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-24-apple-tv-app-amazon-fire-tv-stick.html">Apple TV app</a> has reached its final frontier: your cable provider&#39;s set-top box. <a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/apple-tv-plus-comcast-xfinity-video-platforms-1235099517/">According</a> to <em>Variety</em>, Comcast used its latest <a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/events/event-details/q3-2021-comcast-corporation-earnings-conference-call">earnings call </a>to reveal that the Apple TV app will be available on Comcast&#39;s platforms in the &quot;coming months.&quot; Viewers with Xfinity X1 set-tops, Flex streaming hubs, XClass TVs and (in the UK and Europe) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sky-smart-tv-glass-comcast-095543008.html">Sky Glass</a> sets will have access to Apple TV+, in-app channels (like AMC+ and Showtime) and Apple&#39;s usual video purchases and rentals.</p><p>In exchange, Comcast is bringing its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-02-14-comcasts-all-in-one-xfinity-stream-app-arrives-february-28th.html">Xfinity Stream</a> app to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-4k-review-2021-new-siri-remote-150054255.html">Apple TV hardware</a>.

This may be the best Ninja cooker deal yet — there was a Prime Day deal <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-prime-day-2020-ninja-foodi-pressure-cooker-deal-125220414.html">last year</a> for a less-capable (if larger) 9-in-1 model that still cost more.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3pHIhB3" id="847ddb3d96224d50a5b77dddd4c34fda" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Ninja OS301 Foodi 10-in-1">Buy OS301 Foodi 10-in-1 at Amazon - $119</a><p>It&#39;s easy to see the appeal for this model. It handles typical multicooker tasks like pressure cooking, slow cooking, steaming and yogurt, but it also includes air frying (not always present in multicookers) and a nesting broil rack that lets you broil or steam on different levels. The 6.5-quart capacity is also just slightly higher than the six quarts you find in comparable Instant Pot models, so Ninja&#39;s offering is worth considering if you&#39;re worried about space.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The drawbacks mainly stem from your choice of ecosystem. Instant Pot&#39;s fandom is large enough that you&#39;ll find recipes and other guides for it where you won&#39;t with Ninja&#39;s cookers.

In addition to Shark&#39;s IQ navigation, it also maps out your home as it cleans so you can tell it to only clean the living room or the kitchen by using the mobile app. And if you don&#39;t want to bother with manual cleanings, you can set a schedule in the mobile app, too, and let the robot do all the work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This robot vacuum also cleans itself — it&#39;ll automatically empty its bin into the clean base that comes with it. Yes, you&#39;ll have to empty the base once every month or so, but that&#39;s much more convenient than having to remember to dump out the robot&#39;s contents every time. Also, Shark&#39;s clean base is bagless, so you don&#39;t have to buy proprietary liners like you do with other robots that come with similar bases.</p><p>If you can live without the clean base, a few other <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark vacuums" href="https://amzn.to/3vWWPh5">Shark vacuums</a> — both robot and not — are on sale right now, too. Of note is the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Shark IQ AV970" href="https://amzn.to/3BoERVK">Shark IQ AV970</a>, which is down to $250. That&#39;s $150 off its normal price and close to its all-time low of $230. It has many of the same features as the RV1001AE, including a self-cleaning brush roll, IQ navigation and Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands. Aside from the clean base, you&#39;ll have to forgo home mapping with this model, but you&#39;ll get an extra-large dust bin, which allows the robot to suck up more dirt and debris before you need to empty it.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3BoERVK" id="48ede0ab78f840b4a37e423b3a503408" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Shark IQ AV970 at Amazon - $250</a><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sharks-self-emptying-robot-vacuum-is-nearly-half-off-today-133007846.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cdeb78bd-041e-4ff6-b4e3-bce586036334</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 28 Oct 2021 13:30:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635425424</ingested><modified>2021-10-28T12:50:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8c41330-37ec-11ec-b3f1-fb67d2b61a26" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/b8c41330-37ec-11ec-b3f1-fb67d2b61a26" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Shark]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Shark IQ RV1001AE robot vacuum]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
