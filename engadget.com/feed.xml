Earlier this month, Tencent was forced to cut <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tencent-limits-honor-of-kings-play-time-122045915.html">the amount of time minors could play</a> the smash hit mobile title <em>Honor of Kings</em> to just an hour on weeknights and two hours on the weekend. The added restriction is likely to impact the share price of companies in this space, which has seen recent instability.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Historically, China has always had an aversion to video games, albeit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2013-01-30-china-console-ban.html">with more nuance than most people believe.</a> The country has, however, amplified anti-game rhetoric in recent years, and on August 3rd, a key state-owned news outlet described video games as “spiritual opium.” The piece, as reported by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/technology/china-video-game-tencent.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, went on to outline all of the ways in which gaming could harm Chinese kids.</p><p>As well as the time limit for online gaming (and we’ve asked our colleagues to clarify if any of this can also apply to offline and console gaming), authorities want all titles hooked up to some form of anti-addiction system. Other new rules include companies keeping (real) name data for all users, more reporting on the use of in-game transactions, and more regulatory scrutiny more generally.</p><p>It’s not clear how much of an impact this will have in the real-world since Tencent says minors make up a very small part of its overall business. But given the country’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-data-privacy-rules-130029351.html">continued</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-tencent-wechat-youth-mode-lawsuit-211811555.html">assault</a> on various parts of the tech industry, it’s likely that there will be more hoops for businesses to jump through in future. A week ago, meanwhile, South Korea declared that it would ditch its infamous &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-gaming-shutdown-law-end-163212494.html">Cinderella Law</a>,&quot; banning video gamers from playing between midnight and 6am, saying that it is respecting children&#39;s rights.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/china-cuts-kids-gaming-time-132539606.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bec46028-5711-4f0d-bd04-2c3cb8ad030a</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 13:25:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630328750</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T13:06:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Small Businesses]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ba531d50-e39a-11eb-be9a-4c89a3a19292" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ba531d50-e39a-11eb-be9a-4c89a3a19292" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barcroft Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SHANGHAI, CHINA - JULY 7, 2021 - Photo taken on July 7, 2021 shows Tencent's Honour of Kings exhibition stand in Shanghai, China.

The new platform will, Fossil promises, offer a number of quality-of-life improvements including faster loading times and the ability to fast charge to 80 percent in half an hour. In addition, the new watches will offer continuous heart-rate tracking, a new blood oxygenation sensor and a new built-in wellness app for more reliable activity tracking. Oh, and users will be able to make tethered calls thanks to an integral speaker and microphone combo, should you need the feature.</p><p>Naturally, Fossil has made it clear that these Gen 6 watches, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-5-no-wear-os-upgrade-and-gen-6-205355585.html">unlike the current (and older) models</a>, will be compatible with<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-samsung-new-wear-os-rip-tizen-183031381.html"> Wear OS 3</a> and users can expect to receive the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-wear-os-3-update-release-date-160045459.html">update due in 2022</a>. The new watches will launch in two sizes: a 42mm case with three color options, while you can get four different paint jobs if you opt for the 44mm case. Both devices, however, have a 1.28-inch round AMOLED display (326 ppi), with 8GB of built-in storage and 1GB of RAM. Since a big part of Fossil’s sales pitch is customizability, you’ll also get a wide variety of strap choices to help make these devices more suited to your personal style, too.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Fossil Gen 6 watches will cost between $299 and $319, with pre-orders open now.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fossil-gen-6-wear-os-smartwatches-130028235.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b6b0c2cf-e5e0-4cf5-a2b6-ac41b0b5adec</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 13:00:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630329520</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T13:18:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a48010d0-0976-11ec-9eff-747c26dd3d0a" width="1800" height="1201" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a48010d0-0976-11ec-9eff-747c26dd3d0a" width="1800" height="1201" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Fossil]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Fossil Gen 6]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Fossil Gen 6]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Our verdict on Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 3]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’ll get into Samsung’s bigger foldable below, but first let’s talk about a new, kind of, PS5. You might have struggled to get a PS5, though anecdotal evidence suggests a lot of us have been able to find consoles as stores stock up, but that hasn’t stopped Sony sneaking out a <em>slightly </em>new model. According to a teardown of the digital (no disc-drive) PlayStation 5 by Austin Evans, there seems to be a<a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-revision-smaller-heatsink-142922979.html"> smaller, lighter heatsink</a> and a new screw to attach the console to its stand.</p><p>So no, this isn’t like the smaller PlayStation consoles the company likes to roll out during a console’s midlife — it’s way too early for that. It does show that the company is looking for ways to shave production costs and get these consoles into profitability.</p><p>Interestingly, Sony already stated it’s selling the disc-based PS5 at a profit. Games consoles typically sell at a loss for the first couple of years after launch. Hopefully, that smaller heatsink will still handle the bigger, more lavish titles on their way to the PS5.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review</a></h2><h3>Doing the most and yet not enough</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/897c7a90-074f-11ec-b775-b068887a84ef" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="A Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 on a table with an S Pen Pro in front of it." data-uuid="6686c526-24dd-3a04-884d-ab02c7c33fe5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure></a><h3></h3><p>The Z Fold 3 is an impressively refined foldable, with water-resistant hardware that feels sturdier than before.

Amazingly, she found that the same gamerpic Noukon purchased was still on sale, albeit at nearly two and half times the price, but she gladly splurged the $2.38 to buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>Right off the bat, Marie noticed that Xbox 360 gamerpics display differently if you&#39;re looking at your own profile or someone else&#39;s. On your own, the avatar is displayed as above and looks truly wonky. On someone else&#39;s profile, it displays better against your background, but it&#39;s still tiny and the edges are cut off by the circular format of newer gamerpics.&nbsp;</p><div id="827f64da19dd4c7cbb7fb3b3a1d9d906"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Before we even think about what looks good, we need to look at the inconsistency in the profile page/editor that started this thread. 360 gamerpics look fundamentally different here depending on whether you&#39;re looking at your own profile (broken) or someone else&#39;s (intended). <a href="https://t.co/m5o0sXHfMx">pic.twitter.com/m5o0sXHfMx</a></p>— Eden Marie (@neonepiphany) <a href="https://twitter.com/neonepiphany/status/1430771417298083848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>The grey border issue turned out to be a bug introduced at some point, so Marie was able to fix that first.

Marie noted that the fix will be introduced for all Xbox users still rocking those old gamerpics. &quot;PS, since there have been questions, this will need to roll out with other console updates, Insiders first, and this will change how all 360 gamerpics show up on console, not just certain ones,&quot; she noted. The fix has now been added to the Alpha ring, so if all goes well, it should fix everybody&#39;s messed up Xbox 360 gamerpics in the coming months.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/your-tiny-xbox-360-gamerpic-may-finally-display-properly-on-modern-consoles-103031164.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">e2f4381d-912a-4272-bedd-da8db718569e</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 10:30:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630311177</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T08:13:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5a4f580-0960-11ec-afda-2a58abd767b5" width="1425" height="912" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b5a4f580-0960-11ec-afda-2a58abd767b5" width="1425" height="912" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eden Marie]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Your tiny Xbox 360 gamerpic may finally display properly on modern consoles]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Your tiny Xbox 360 gamerpic may finally display properly on modern consoles]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[VW customers will soon have a choice for in-car 4G connectivity]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Volkswagen has <a href="https://media.vw.com/en-us/releases/1590">unveiled</a> a new feature for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-12-volkswagen-siri-shortcuts-car-net.html">Car-Net</a> connected vehicle service that lets you get 4G data from two major US telecoms.

The fact that it&#39;s soldered directly to the motherboard rather than being a separate component is one contributing factor in its middling 5/10 repairability score, according to a new teardown from YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8uaCrGkca8"><em>PBKreviews</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>The Pixel 5a is Google&#39;s midrange 5G smartphone and a direct successor to the popular 5G <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-samples-specs-price-150053038.html">Pixel 4a</a>. Though a bit larger than the latter and now water-resistant, it&#39;s equipped with nearly the same internal components, including a Snapdragon 765G, 6GB of RAM and a 60Hz panel. It&#39;s a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">solid</a> mid-range phone for $449, though essentially a stopgap device until Google unveils the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">Pixel 6</a> family that will use its all-new Tensor mobile chip.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="03b8867a857048189a3d77b19c222352"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8uaCrGkca8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The good news is that the 6.34-inch OLED display is relatively easy to replace, as you can pull it off simply by heating it up and using a pry tool to pop it off. It&#39;s also fairly straightforward to get access to the battery and motherboard, once you remove the numerous screws and pry off the large metal cover.</p><p>From there, however, things get trickier. The battery is glued solidly to the case and the pry tab meant to help remove it is &quot;pretty useless,&quot; according to <em>PBKreviews.</em> Instead, they had to use isopropyl alcohol to loosen the glue before they could pry the battery out. The other issue is that the USB-C port is attached directly to the motherboard, so making repairs to it would be &quot;difficult,&quot; according to the video.&nbsp;</p><p>All told, however, the Pixel 5a appears to be slightly easier to repair than its predecessor. While you might not try to fix it yourself, that means it could be a bit easier to find local service if you&#39;d rather not send it away to Google. The teardown also shows a solid-looking device with water resistance as a big new benefit — so hopefully, all that will add up to a reliable device that won&#39;t need repairs in the first place.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-teardown-shows-that-its-still-a-challenge-to-repair-051041017.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb1a6546-5228-4d10-9683-47de1876a9f4</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 30 Aug 2021 05:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630300240</ingested><modified>2021-08-30T05:10:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d2ac9b80-094a-11ec-bfe5-411c73857c0f" width="2048" height="1153" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d2ac9b80-094a-11ec-bfe5-411c73857c0f" width="2048" height="1153" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5a teardown shows that it's still a pain to repair]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 5a teardown shows that it's still a pain to repair]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 will reportedly offer larger cases and screens]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a> might be a more substantial redesign than you think. <em>Bloomberg</em>&#39;s Mark Gurman claims Series 7 will come in larger 41mm and 45mm case sizes (up from 40mm and 44mm) with bigger screens to match.

You could get in touch on a remote camping trip without any cell service, and without buying a separate satellite communicator.</p><p>The iPhone would supposedly use a modified version of Qualcomm&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-18-qualcomm-snapdragon-x60-5g-mmwave-qtm535-ultrasaw-rf-filter.html">X60 modem</a> to talk to satellites. It&#39;s not certain if satellite support would be limited to certain apps, although we wouldn&#39;t be surprised if that were the case. Mobile satellite service is often far slower than conventional cellular data, ruling out many of the internet-intensive apps people take for granted.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s good reason to be skeptical. A <em>Bloomberg</em> rumor from 2019 had Apple developing satellite technology for the iPhone, but the team reportedly hoped to ship a product within five years — two years might be too early, assuming the leaks were accurate in the first place. There are also logistical questions to address, such as the choice of service providers. Satellite service has historically been expensive, and it might be a tough sell even if you regularly venture beyond cellular coverage.</p><p>Many expect Apple to launch the new iPhone lineup in September. It&#39;s not certain if this would be limited to Pro models or reach the entire iPhone range.</p><p>If there is a satellite linkup, though, Apple might have a stronger hook for the new iPhone than rumored display and camera upgrades. This would be the first mainstream smartphone offering connectivity virtually anywhere on the planet, and competitors might not match the feature for a while.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-13-leo-satellite-communication-165409961.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">84f12ff9-556b-4494-8843-28ed436b3a9e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 16:54:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630256052</ingested><modified>2021-08-29T16:54:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Telecommunication]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/abd9b4e0-08e4-11ec-bb9b-e9045122ef78" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/abd9b4e0-08e4-11ec-bb9b-e9045122ef78" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max handheld]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max handheld]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Kindle Paperwhite drops to all-time low price of $71 in one-day sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now might be a good time to buy an e-reader for school — or that end-of-summer vacation.

YouTube creator Austin Evans has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taKKVBVoKhg">posted</a> a teardown that shows the revised PS5 Digital Edition (that is, the no-disc model) is using a smaller, likely lower-cost heatsink. While this shaves a whopping 0.66lbs off the weight, it also raises the overall temperature by a few degrees — not necessarily a major issue, but worth noting if you either <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-ps5-ssd-expansion-upgrade-150052315.html">upgrade your SSD</a> or stuff your system into a crowded media cabinet.</p><p>There are subtler changes as well, including an easier-to-use stand screw and tweaked connections to the WiFi chip, although it&#39;s not clear if or how the wireless changes make a practical difference. It&#39;s also uncertain how many of these changes translate to the disc drive version of the PS5.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company hasn&#39;t officially explained its design choices for the updated PS5. As Evans speculates, however, the refreshed PS5 may be a cost-cutting measure that reflects lessons learned in the several months since the machine&#39;s debut. Now that Sony knows how well the cooling and other components perform, it knows where it can afford to use cheaper, simpler parts.</p><p>The timing is apt. In its first-quarter earnings briefing, Sony <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/ps5-is-no-longer-selling-at-a-loss/">told investors</a> it was no longer selling the disc-based PS5 at a loss — this latest design could make the Digital Edition profitable that much sooner. While the choice won&#39;t thrill gamers with bitter memories of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2009-09-04-new-study-finds-close-to-one-quarter-of-xbox-360s-fail-within-tw.html">overheating Xbox 360s</a> (however unlikely a repeat might be), it might play an important role in Sony&#39;s long-term health.</p><div id="1bc7ceb67b9b4d399da2917505a687e4"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taKKVBVoKhg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/sony-ps5-revision-smaller-heatsink-142922979.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8086dd3a-b840-4d32-9e5a-e22dabf3cd9a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 14:29:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630273055</ingested><modified>2021-08-29T21:37:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/8a98d6b0-9eba-11eb-bfe9-02e092290fb2" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/8a98d6b0-9eba-11eb-bfe9-02e092290fb2" width="1800" height="1200" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Aaron Souppouris/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5 with Xbox Series X in background]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sony PlayStation 5 with Xbox Series X in background]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google reportedly offered Netflix a special discount on Play Store fees]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Google has been accused of playing favorites in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-suit-211116918.html">treatment of Android app developers</a>. <em>The Verge</em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/28/22645974/google-netflix-class-action-antitrust-play-store-commission">reports</a> a newly <a href="https://twitter.com/MActon93/status/1431398527658119172">unsealed</a> consumer lawsuit against Google alleges the company offered to take a &quot;significantly reduced&quot; cut of Netflix&#39;s Play Store revenue in order to quell the streaming giant&#39;s &quot;displeasure.&quot; Netflix, Spotify and Tinder all supposedly tried to get around the requirement to use Play Store&#39;s in-house billing system, and deals like this were meant to keep Netflix using Google&#39;s payment platform.</p><p>The same filing also <a href="https://twitter.com/MActon93/status/1431398632134037505">includes</a> a claim that Google&#39;s normal revenue share is arbitrary. Where the company typically asks for a 30 percent cut of Play Store purchases, it apparently determined that it could break even with just six percent.  Internal communications suggest Google chose the 30 percent share for no reason &quot;other than copying Apple,&quot; according to the lawsuit.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked Google for comment. In a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, a spokeswoman maintained that developers were bound to the same policies as &quot;all other developers,&quot; and that there were efforts to back app makers with &quot;enhanced resources and investments.&quot; These initiatives were evidence of &quot;healthy competition&quot; in operating systems and app stores, Google said.</p><p>If the allegations are true, though, that wouldn&#39;t be the case — Google would have given Netflix a sweetheart deal not available to other Play Store developers. The company wouldn&#39;t be alone, either. Internal emails also suggest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-emails-show-how-it-tried-to-stop-netflix-from-dropping-in-app-purchases-082653224.html">Apple offered Netflix perks</a> it didn&#39;t provide to others using the App Store.</p><p>Whatever the case, Google might not have much choice but to alter its practices. Apple recently<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-change-app-store-rules-class-action-lawsuit-010727976.html"> softened the App Store&#39;s rules</a> as part of a proposed settlement, going so far as to let developers pitch customers on alternative payment systems — something Google still forbids, as the attorneys behind the unsealed lawsuit point out. Between these latest revelations and other lawsuits, such as those <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-google-play-lawsuit-035741548.html">from Epic</a> and state attorneys general, Google faces strong pressure to follow Apple and otherwise make concessions to avoid more serious legal repercussions.</p><div id="515d3fa617d4437d8b95241493286a3a"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Epic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Epic</a> filed its unsealed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Google?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Google</a> Play Store lawsuit, consumers have filed. 3 things:<br><br>1 - Says Google offered <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@netflix</a> special deal to stop them griping about 30% fee<br><br>2 - Says Google estimated <a href="https://twitter.com/SamsungUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SamsungUS</a> made $0.1 bn from store in 2019 compared to Google&#39;s $4bn</p>— Michael Acton (@MActon93) <a href="https://twitter.com/MActon93/status/1431398527658119172?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-netflix-fee-deal-210453747.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8dd927cd-5c9d-4f21-95e1-363d804da8a3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 21:04:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630184786</ingested><modified>2021-08-28T21:06:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/46629cc0-dcf8-11eb-963b-286771b88ce3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/46629cc0-dcf8-11eb-963b-286771b88ce3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mika Baumeister on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Play Store on an Android phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Play Store on an Android phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Belarusian hackers are trying to overthrow the Lukashenko regime]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A group of activist-hackers in Belarus has infiltrated almost every part of the the country&#39;s authoritarian government in a bid to overthrow the Lukashenko regime, according to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/08/26/1033205/belarus-cyber-partisans-lukashenko-hack-opposition/"><em>MIT&#39;s Technology Review</em></a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-24/belarus-hackers-seek-to-overthrow-local-government"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>. The hackers, known as Belarus Cyber Partisans, have been leaking information they found on sensitive police and government networks. They first started defacing government websites as an act of protest in September 2020 following the country&#39;s disputed election, in which Alexander Lukashenko&#39;s win was widely considered as fraudulent. But they also publish the information they get on Telegram, where they have 77,000 subscribers.</p><p>The group told the publications that it&#39;s made up of 15 IT and cybersecurity experts working in the country&#39;s tech sector. None of them are &quot;professional hackers,&quot; a spokesperson told <em>Tech Review</em>, with only four out of 15 doing the actual &quot;ethical hacking.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Partisans&#39; most recent attacks gave them access to drone footage from the government&#39;s crackdowns on protests last year and the Ministry of Interior Affairs&#39; mobile phone surveillance database. They also apparently got access to emergency services&#39; audio recordings, as well as video feeds from road speed and isolation cell surveillance cameras. The data the group released over the past weeks include lists of alleged police informants, personal information about top government officials and spies, police drone and detention center footage and secret recordings captured by the government&#39;s wiretapping system.</p><p>If the Cyber Partisans have been effective in their efforts to infiltrate the government&#39;s networks, it&#39;s thanks to the help they get from another group called BYPOL.

As <em>The Post</em> said, Amazon may not be proactively policing its clients&#39; content, relying instead on the complaints it gets.&nbsp;</p><p>Back in January, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-suspends-parler-aws-access-025310355.html">suspended</a> Parler&#39;s AWS hosting services after it found multiple posts on the social network &quot;that clearly encourage and incite violence.&quot; Parler sued Amazon, claiming antitrust violations, but the company said it sent the website <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-responds-parler-lawsuit-203419366.html">several warnings</a> about violent posts on its platform before the takedown. Ultimately, a judge <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-can-keep-parler-servers-offline-judge-203604006.html">shot down</a> Parler&#39;s attempt to get AWS to restore its service, citing the dangers posed by &quot;inflammatory rhetoric&quot; found on the social network.</p><p><strong>Update 8/28 12PM ET:</strong> An AWS spokesperson stressed to Engadget that it was only the website running on AWS, not the app itself, and said company staff &quot;act quickly&quot; whenever there&#39;s a violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. You can read the full statement below.</p><blockquote><p>&quot;The app referenced by the Washington Post is not running on AWS. However, following an investigation, we have disabled a website that was linked to this app as it was in violation of the AWS Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). The AWS AUP prohibits the use of our services to threaten, incite, promote, or actively encourage violence, terrorism, or other serious harm. When we receive reports of potential violations of our AUP, we act quickly to investigate and take action to disable prohibited content.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-disables-isis-propaganda-website-using-aws-to-host-content-043707106.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c96f6ce8-5bf1-4c5c-8040-cbc5cf51fec0</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 28 Aug 2021 04:37:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630166670</ingested><modified>2021-08-28T16:04:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/12fe7ff0-0711-11ec-95ff-49899b52e98f" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/12fe7ff0-0711-11ec-95ff-49899b52e98f" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AAMIR QURESHI via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[People gather to check on missing relatives a day after a twin suicide bombs attack, which killed scores of people including 13 US troops outside Kabul airport, at a hospital run by Italian NGO Emergency in Kabul on August 27, 2021.

Part of that wide-ranging investigation will apparently involve a close look at the biggest social media companies in the world. The committee today <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/news/press-releases/select-committee-demands-records-related-january-6th-attack-social-media-0">announced</a> that it was requesting records relating to the attack from 15 companies, who were asked to respond in the next two weeks.</p><p>It&#39;s a who&#39;s who of the biggest players on the internet, including Google, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Snap, Twitch, Telegram and TikTok. On the list are a number of smaller, pro-Trump sites that have sprung up in recent years, including Gab and Parler, as well as known cesspools 4chan and 8kun (formerly 8chan).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Specifically, the Select Committee wants records relating to the spread of misinformation, efforts to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, efforts to prevent certification of the election, foreign influence attempt in the election, and domestic violent extremism. Additionally, the Committee is also looking for materials from these companies relating to any policy changes that were considered or adopted to address misinformation, violent extremism and foreign malicious influence.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, the Committee wants to hear both about policy changes that were put into place as well as things that the companies &quot;failed to adopt.&quot; One example of a change that came about in response to the attack happened recently at Facebook, where the company adopted a recommendation from its Oversight Board. The company walked back its policy that allowed politicians to circumvent some of its rules under the guise of “newsworthiness,” though politicians still do get special treatment around other rules, like fact-checking.</p><p>It&#39;s been clear since the Select Committee came together that it was going to take the time to gather a huge amount of information to properly investigate the events of January 6th, and that extends to its requests to these companies. Now, the ball is in their respective courts.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-select-committee-social-media-company-records-demand-211356022.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a16e0a6c-a5d5-4b67-87c0-ec8b581001d7</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:13:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630105647</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T23:07:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2021-01%2F8bf401c0-56ac-11eb-affe-cf3bea30c425&amp;compress=1&amp;progressive=1&amp;quality=75&amp;resize=200%2C300&amp;client=hawkeye&amp;signature=a972cd5c17df99a98f8fb102d705b2bbf5fefa72" width="200" height="131" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-01/8bf401c0-56ac-11eb-affe-cf3bea30c425" width="5004" height="3285" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SAUL LOEB via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[(FILES) Supporters of US President Donald Trump walk around in the Rotunda after breaching the US Capitol in Washington, DC, January 6, 2021. - The demonstrators breeched security and entered the Capitol as Congress debated the 2020 presidential election Electoral Vote Certification.

While the complaints point to alleged misconduct specific to each company, they broadly accuse DoorDash and GrubHub of employing a similar set of unfair business practices.</p><p>Specifically, the city claims that both DoorDash and GrubHub have consistently advertised delivery services from restaurants that never consented to a listing on their platforms. The city also alleges they employ &quot;bait-and-switch&quot; tactics by using deceptively small delivery fees to lure customers before hitting them with various other expenses at the end of a transaction. Finally, it says they both hide the fact many restaurants charge less for the items on their menu when you order directly from them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DoorDash called the lawsuit &quot;baseless&quot; and a &quot;waste&quot; of taxpayer money. &quot;DoorDash has stood with the City of Chicago throughout the pandemic, waiving fees for restaurants, providing $500,000 in direct grants, creating strong earning opportunities and delivering food and other necessities to communities in need,&quot; a spokesperson for the company told Engadget.</p><p>GrubHub echoed the sentiments of its competitor. &quot;Every single allegation is categorically wrong, and we will aggressively defend our business practices,&quot; a GrubHub spokesperson said. &quot;We look forward to responding in court and are confident we will prevail.&quot;</p><p>In taking the two companies to court, the city says it seeks to mandate greater transparency from DoorDash and GrubHub, as well as financial restitution for restaurants and consumers hurt by their alleged actions.</p><p>Separately, the DoorDash lawsuit alleges the company misled customers about how it was using tips to pay its delivery workers. If that sounds familiar, it&#39;s because DoorDash agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/doordash-settle-dc-lawsuit-045945934.html">pay a $2.5 million settlement</a> toward the end of 2020 to settle allegations related to that exact same issue.</p><p>For Chicago, this is the latest effort by the city to impose additional regulations on food delivery apps. In May 2020, it implemented a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chicago-itemized-breakdown-delivery-apps-210224890.html">policy </a>that saw both DoorDash and GrubHub required to include an itemized breakdown that lists how much restaurants pay when you order from them using an app.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/chicago-sues-doordash-grubhub-210424254.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c29ba824-a0d9-4deb-a56d-ecbffb741acb</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 21:04:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630098268</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T21:04:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/1b429850-a77a-11eb-bffa-cc370d18fec2" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/1b429850-a77a-11eb-bffa-cc370d18fec2" width="5472" height="3648" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, USA - FEBRUARY 18: A food delivery guy with bicycle is seen as snowfall blankets the Times Square in New York City, United States as massive snow storm hits the east coast on February 18, 2021.
