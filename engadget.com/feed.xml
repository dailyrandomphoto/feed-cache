On Wednesday, the company told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/30/instagram-is-developing-its-own-version-of-twitters-super-follow-with-exclusive-stories/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> the screenshots showcase an internal prototype it&#39;s working on behind the scenes. Unfortunately, Instagram didn&#39;t reveal any other details about the project, noting it had nothing more to share when Engadget reached out.</p><div id="90bc8afa76a84f10990d765c0666b680"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Instagram?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Instagram</a> is working on stories for fan clubs, exclusive stories visible only to fan club members üëÄ<br><br>‚ÑπÔ∏è It is not possible to take screenshots of exclusive stories. <a href="https://t.co/GAYvRFVBss">pic.twitter.com/GAYvRFVBss</a></p>‚Äî Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1406995654900125702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 21, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>But what we can gather from the screenshots is that the feature is Instagram&#39;s take on Twitter&#39;s paid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-opens-applications-super-follows-ticketed-spaces-180002268.html">Super Follow subscription</a>.

Despite being a beta, it‚Äôs surprisingly complete, with<a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-wwdc-2021-facetime-messages-notification-summary-live-text-172526551.html"> most of the coming changes</a> already available. Some of the updates getting the most buzz are the new Focus modes and FaceTime sharing tools, but there are also changes across Messages, Maps, Weather, Safari, Photos and more to check out.</p><p>So far, the preview software seems largely stable. But as always with betas, think twice about how willing you are to<a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/654168"> risk bricking your phone</a> in exchange for early access to new features. Regardless of whether that&#39;s you, we&#39;ve put together a detailed preview of how iOS 15 will work when it launches in the fall.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2><strong>FaceTime: SharePlay, screen sharing and spatial audio</strong></h2><p>Though it would have been a lot more helpful if Apple had launched this feature during the throes of the pandemic, FaceTime‚Äôs SharePlay feature will still be useful for many of us. Whether you want to watch an episode of <em>Ted Lasso</em> with your long-distance buddy or provide remote tech support to your relatives, SharePlay and screen sharing over FaceTime will make your life a little easier.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/1f4c6110-d95c-11eb-bd46-8c464c8fa9d8" alt="A composite of two screenshots showing FaceTime&#39;s new control panel and screen sharing feature." data-uuid="64870329-95a0-3b86-a853-cfe4ea278d27"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshots of iOS 15 beta</div></figure><p>Unfortunately, my colleague Mat Smith and I had to futz around for ages before we figured out how to SharePlay something. While screen sharing is more straightforward ‚Äî just press a button at the bottom right of a new control panel at the top of FaceTime calls ‚Äî SharePlay options only show up when you have a compatible media app open during a chat. Mat and I are seasoned tech journalists and we still spent some time looking for a SharePlay-specific button, which seems like the more intuitive way.</p><p>Once we figured it out, things went a little more smoothly. When you try to play an episode or video while on a FaceTime call, a window pops up asking if you want to use SharePlay. From there, you can choose to stream with your caller (or callers), play it only for yourself, or cancel.</p><p>As a reminder, depending on the app, both you and your friend will need subscriptions to watch stuff together on SharePlay. For Apple‚Äôs services like TV+ and Music, you‚Äôll both need a subscription or trial. Other streaming apps like HBO Max, Hulu and Disney+ will be the ones that decide whether all parties need accounts to watch shows together on SharePlay, but it‚Äôs highly unlikely they allow it some other way.</p><p>On our attempts to stream episodes of <em>Mythic Quest</em> and <em>Central Park</em> on SharePlay, though, Mat and I kept getting a failure notice saying ‚ÄúUnable to SharePlay. This title isn‚Äôt available to SharePlay with people in different countries or regions.‚Äù It‚Äôs odd, since both those shows are available in both our regions. It‚Äôs also sad that you wouldn‚Äôt be allowed to watch it with someone abroad. Apple hasn‚Äôt said if this limit will be in place when iOS 15 launches, but if it is it‚Äôll be disappointing for anyone that was looking forward to SharePlaying with their overseas partners, families and friends. We‚Äôll update this article if Apple confirms this either way.</p><p>Screen sharing worked better. I was able to show Mat my dubious shopping list on Instagram though, as it does with other video chat apps, my camera automatically turned off whenever I shared my screen. When Mat streamed his display, his camera stayed on. We suspect this has something to do with the fact that he‚Äôs using a more capable iPhone 12 mini while I was on an aging iPhone XR that was burning up from my testing. This is a known issue with SharePlay that <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes">has been detailed in the iOS 15 developer beta release notes</a>, so it may get fixed in time.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/575774a0-d95c-11eb-bdd2-1b173732121a" alt="A composite showing three screenshots of FaceTime&#39;s SharePlay feature in the iOS 15 beta. " data-uuid="dedcd607-c97c-3f0b-a38f-e05c6263f3ad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshots of the iOS 15 beta</div></figure><p>Two other FaceTime features that are also live in this beta:<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-facetime-wwdc-2021-171840284.html"> links to join calls from non-Apple devices</a> and spatial audio. The latter lets you hear each person in a call from the direction where they‚Äôre positioned on your FaceTime grid. Since it required multiple people running the beta to work, I couldn‚Äôt fully experience this. I got on a call with Mat and our former colleague Chris Velazco, and while Mat and I were able to hear each other from different directions, Chris wasn‚Äôt on the beta and did not notice the effect.</p><p>I also sent FaceTime web links to Chris, as well as Engadget staffers Nathan Ingraham and Valentina Palladino. The URL brought us to a page that prompted us to enter our names, and as the host I could choose to allow or block each would-be participant. Chris was able to join my call from a non-Apple laptop, while Valentina and Nate went through the browser on their Macs. Meanwhile, I was using an iPhone. Everyone looked and sounded great‚Ä¶ to me.</p><p>Valentina and Nate couldn‚Äôt hear each other until they used the FaceTime app on their MacBooks. Chris also couldn‚Äôt hear other people on the call ‚Äî all anyone heard was my beautiful voice. (As it should be.) But really, this appears to be an issue with how browsers handle audio input devices or a possible bug in the beta.</p><p>It‚Äôs not yet clear whether the region-specific SharePlay restrictions will also work this way in the stable release. But so far, barring <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes">some glitches</a>, the updates to Apple‚Äôs video calling app appear meaty and potentially very useful.</p><h2><strong>Focus modes</strong></h2><p>I‚Äôve spent too much time talking about FaceTime, so I‚Äôm going to try to succinctly describe the other iOS 15 features I‚Äôve tested thus far. One of these felt incredibly relevant as I spent time finishing this article on deadline: Focus modes. Here, Apple allows you to customize profiles that will allow notifications from specific apps or people when enabled.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/ecee9d10-d9b9-11eb-acfd-7c0aaa1a7a01" alt="A composite showing three screenshots of the Focus Mode feature in the iOS 15 beta. The first two show shortcuts to enable profiles like Do Not Disturb, Personal, Sleep and Work. The screenshot on the right show a detailed Settings page for the Work profile. " data-uuid="61703add-ca1a-390e-962a-2f4170bc1f6d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshots from the iOS 15 beta</div></figure><p>Three placeholders are available at the start: Work, Bedtime and Personal. On your first time trying to enable each, you‚Äôll have to set up which contacts and apps to allow. You can also choose to enable your Focus Status so people who try to reach you will see that you‚Äôre away when they‚Äôre using a compatible app. Developers of messaging apps will have to use Apple‚Äôs API to enable this, so that your friends who hit you up on, say, Telegram or Facebook Messenger will see your status too.</p><p>For now, only Apple‚Äôs own Messages supports it and I was able to see below our conversation that Mat had silenced notifications. I sent a message anyway, and the app showed my text was ‚Äúdelivered quietly.‚Äù Just like you can on Slack, you can choose to ‚Äúnotify anyway‚Äù so your message breaks through the wall of silence. (I‚Äôm not an awful person so I didn‚Äôt, poor Mat had already put up with my relentless testing and FaceTiming all day.)</p><p>With each Focus mode, you can also pick a home screen showing just the apps you want. To do so, you‚Äôll have to first create each page as an additional panel on your main screen, then select the relevant one when customizing your Focus mode. I created a barebones page with just four apps and designated it as my main Personal screen. I also made a different option for Work and was able to have apps appear on multiple pages ‚Äî Instagram and Twitter could be placed on every page, for example. When each mode was enabled, I couldn‚Äôt see any other page; swiping sideways only showed the apps drawer and the Today view.</p><p>I haven‚Äôt spent enough time with the beta to know how useful these customized views will be, but I‚Äôm already in love with the ability to pick different notifications profiles. You can also set them to automatically activate based on the time of day, your location or app usage. Again, this is something I‚Äôll need to use for more than a few days, but I appreciate the concept. Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt encountered Notifications summaries in the beta yet.</p><h2><strong>Live text (aka Apple‚Äôs version of Google Lens)</strong></h2><p>Many other iOS 15 updates are similar to features that competitors already offer, and the most obvious of these is Live Text. This tool scans the photos on your device for words and turns them into text you can actually use, whether it‚Äôs copying and pasting a phone number to another app or translating foreign words on a menu. This is basically Apple&#39;s answer to Google Lens, which has been around for years.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/deb5d810-d95c-11eb-bbcb-b3c3a9983787" alt="A composite showing three screenshots of Apple&#39;s Live Text feature through the viewfinder in the Camera app in the iOS 15 beta. The left screenshot shows a small yellow frame focused on the middle of a bottle of green moisturizer, the middle screenshot shows the middle part of the bottle highlighted with options above it for " data-uuid="88cace24-b8c1-3780-b2d5-c1e670ea35f6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshots of the iOS 15 beta</div></figure><p>Similar to Lens, Apple‚Äôs version will show a small symbol at the bottom right of each image in the Photos app to indicate it‚Äôs found something. Tap that icon, and all the characters in that picture will be highlighted, and you can select the portions you need. I snapped a picture of my bottle of moisturizer and was able to copy all the words on the label and URLs also got identified as links I could click through. You can also use Live Text via the Camera app‚Äôs viewfinder without snapping a shot, by the way. When your phone detects words in the scene, the same icon will appear in the bottom right and you can hit it to pull up the snippets that Live Text noticed.</p><p>So far, this generally performed as expected, though it&#39;s worth noting that as its name suggests, Live Text only works on images that have a lot of words in them. But even a photo of my dinner, which included a container of yogurt with a brand name prominently displayed on it, didn‚Äôt trigger Live Text. Google‚Äôs Lens, meanwhile, will identify buildings, pets, furniture and clothes in pictures with nary a letter in them.</p><h2><strong>Maps, Photos and generally tighter integration</strong></h2><p>Elsewhere in iOS 15 you‚Äôll find updates to Maps, Weather and Photos. In some cities, Apple‚Äôs<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-maps-new-ui-is-a-boon-for-the-navigationally-challenged-175930403.html"> maps look richer and more detailed</a> than before, thanks to meticulous drawings of individual trees, lanes, traffic lights and more. I was able to explore a golf course in San Francisco, as well as the Conservatory of Flowers and Dutch Windmill in the Golden Gate Park in surprisingly detailed 2D and 3D views. I <em>was</em> disappointed when I zoomed super close to the Penguin Island in the San Francisco zoo and there were no cute little feathered friends. But I guess that‚Äôd be too much to ask.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/48417f50-d95d-11eb-a76f-592f83acd2c6" alt="A composite of three screenshots from the Maps app in the iOS 15 beat showing 3D drawings from around San Francisco. Landmarks include the San Francisco Zoo and Penguin Island. " data-uuid="be0921ff-2887-3519-82ad-144d246d69b4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshots of the iOS 15 beta</div></figure><p>Memories in Photos has also been updated to give you greater control over who shows up in them and what music plays in the background. You can now edit your pictures‚Äô descriptions to create richer alt text that stays with each image as you forward them to friends. I liked using this to identify people and places in a photo for contacts who are blind or have low vision. Even though I added keywords like ‚Äúsunset‚Äù and people‚Äôs names to some pictures‚Äô descriptions, searches for those words in my iPhone‚Äôs Spotlight didn‚Äôt return those images. It would be nice, but the descriptions aren‚Äôt currently being indexed for that.</p><p>But that‚Äôs another update in iOS 15: Spotlight searches for all things in your phone will now include your photos in results, too. It uses Apple‚Äôs own machine learning to detect things in your library though, and this is still sometimes inaccurate. I searched for ‚ÄúCherlynn‚Äù and ‚ÄúSunset‚Äù and was shown screenshots with my name in them and an image of a red-hot map of New York from the Weather app that Apple thought was a sunset. This isn‚Äôt perfect, but at least photos are better integrated into Spotlight now.</p><p>Another update that provides better integration across iOS is the consolidation of media that your friends send you. Apple calls this<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-messages-ios-15-shared-with-you-173052730.html"> Share With You</a>, and things from your recent interactions with each person will show up there ‚Äî pictures that Mat sent me of his adorable baby niece, as well as the screenshots he shared from our FaceTime adventures, were all in his page in the Phone app.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/6f33be20-d95d-11eb-b3de-c1f3f2567e1e" alt="A composite of two screenshots showing the Weather app in the iOS 15 beta. " data-uuid="1e0101f5-3b91-376b-9eb7-b0fe5e77fae8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshots of the iOS 15 beta</div></figure><p>There‚Äôs still a ton more to explore not only in the public beta but in iOS 15 when the final release is ready. The Weather app has new maps that appropriately show just how scorching hot it‚Äôs been in the New York area these last few days. And we still have to test more things like Safari mobile extensions and<a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-wallet-drivers-license-ios-15-tsa-174600256.html"> ID and keys support in Wallet</a>. For now, this has been an intriguing taste of what to expect in the software update. Despite a few snags, it looks like iPhone users will have plenty to look forward to later this year.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-public-beta-testing-hands-on-172526761.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bb0dac90-1a5c-4246-b26a-6ff28a743e22</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 17:25:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625073931</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T17:25:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/55842480-d9ba-11eb-bebf-168e03ab2aa1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/55842480-d9ba-11eb-bebf-168e03ab2aa1" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[An iPhone XR laying on a white surface showing "What's new in iOS 15" on its screen.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iOS 15 beta ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The iOS 15, iPadOS 15 and watchOS 8 public betas are here]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s plenty to look forward to in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-15-wwdc-2021-facetime-messages-notification-summary-live-text-172526551.html">the upcoming iOS 15 update</a>: SharePlay in FaceTime, new Focus modes, better Maps and Weather apps, as well as deeper integration across Messages, Photos and more. Though there&#39;s still some time to wait before the next OS officially rolls out, those eager to try early versions of these new features can check them out starting today. Apple has released the iOS 15 public beta and if you&#39;re curious enough to install potentially unstable software, you can run it today. Additionally, Apple also dropped the public betas for iPadOS 15 (which shares many of the same features as iOS 15) and watchOS 8. Make sure you back up your data before you begin!</p><p>iOS 15 will be compatible with iPhone 6S and later (including both generations of the iPhone SE), as well as the 7th-generation iPod Touch. Those hoping to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wwdc-2021-apple-watchos-8-announcement-new-features-availability-182525376.html">test watchOS 8</a> will also need an Apple Watch Series 3, 4, 5 or 6 running the iOS 15 beta. If you have compatible hardware, all you have to do is sign up for Apple&#39;s beta program on its website here. You&#39;ll get a notification that it&#39;s ready to install (or you can keep looking at your &quot;Software update&quot; page in Settings). We&#39;ve been using a developer beta build for a couple of days and, assuming it&#39;s largely similar to the public beta, the software seems fairly stable with occasional glitches in specific apps.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While your devices are enrolled in the beta program, you&#39;ll receive updates automatically when they&#39;re publicly available. If you&#39;ve played around with the preview and decide you&#39;ve had enough, you can revert to an older version <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/unenroll">by unenrolling</a>.

Citing an internal survey of developers, she noted that 39 percent of them indicated they were unhappy with the App Store‚Äôs distribution. What incentive, then, she asked, does Apple have to work with them?</p><p>Cook seemed to be caught off guard by the question. He said Apple rejects a lot of apps and that ‚Äúfriction‚Äù can be a good thing for users. Rogers replied that it ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt seem you feel pressure or competition to change the manner in which you act to address concerns of developers.‚Äù</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It was a brief but telling exchange. And one that strikes at the heart of Apple‚Äôs currently rocky relationship with developers.</p><h2>Epic vs. Apple vs. developers</h2><p>Ostensibly, Epic‚Äôs antitrust case against Apple was about the iPhone maker‚Äôs treatment of <em>Fortnite</em> and its refusal to allow the game developer to bypass the App Store for in-app purchases. Epic, along with many other prominent developers, has long chafed at Apple‚Äôs 30 percent commission, or ‚ÄúApp Store‚Äù tax.</p><p>It‚Äôs not just that they see 30 percent as greedy and unfair (Apple recently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-small-business-program-15-percent-112259064.html">lowered</a> its take to 15 percent for small developers). It‚Äôs that Apple has appeared to treat some developers differently than others. For example, documents unearthed during the trial detail how Apple went to great lengths to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-emails-show-how-it-tried-to-stop-netflix-from-dropping-in-app-purchases-082653224.html">prevent Netflix</a> from yanking in-app purchases from its app.</p><p>After considering ‚Äúpunitive measures‚Äù toward the streaming giant, Apple offered Netflix custom APIs that most developers don&#39;t have access to. It also dangled the possibility of additional promotion in the App Store or even at its physical retail stores. Netflix ended up pulling in-app purchases anyway, but it was illustrative of the kind of ‚Äúspecial treatment‚Äù many developers have long suspected Apple employs towards <a href="https://www.engadget.com/news-sites-join-epic-in-fight-against-apples-high-i-os-store-fees-091530276.html">some apps</a>.</p><p>Meanwhile, game developers have no choice but to pay Apple‚Äôs ‚Äútax.‚Äù Not only that, but Apple‚Äôs rules prohibit them from even alerting their users that they may be able to make the same purchase elsewhere for less ‚Äî what‚Äôs known as its ‚Äúanti-steering‚Äù rules.</p><p>Friction over these rules is nothing new. But the details of these arrangements, and Apple‚Äôs hardball tactics with developers, had never been as exposed as they were during the trial.</p><p>‚ÄúWhat was great about the Epic trial was that it brought many of these issues to light and into the public dialogue,‚Äù said Meghan DiMuzio, executive director for the Coalition for App Fairness, an advocacy group representing developers who believe Apple‚Äôs policies are anticompetitive. ‚ÄúI think we saw how Apple more generally chooses to approach their relationships with developers and how they value, or don&#39;t value, their relationships with developers. I think those are really incredible soundbites and storylines to have out in the public eye.‚Äù</p><p>The case touched on other issues that have been the source of long-simmering developer frustrations with Cupertino, and not just for giants like Netflix. Epic also highlighted common developer complaints around App Store search ads, fraudulent apps and Apple‚Äôs often inscrutable review process.</p><p>In one particularly memorable exchange, the developer of yoga app Down Dog spoke at length about how Apple‚Äôs opaque policies can have an outsize impact on developers. For example, he said Apple had repeatedly rejected app updates for seemingly bizarre reasons, like using a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-04/apple-lawyer-needles-epic-ceo-to-punch-holes-in-antitrust-claims">‚Äúwrong‚Äù color</a> on a login page. Once, he said, an update was rejected because App Store reviewers couldn‚Äôt find his app‚Äôs integration with Apple‚Äôs Health app. He later realized it was because the reviewers were testing on an iPad, which doesn‚Äôt support the Health app.</p><p>These types of complaints are probably familiar to most developers. It‚Äôs not unusual for Apple to quibble over the placement of a particular button, or some other minor feature. These seemingly small issues can drag on for days or weeks, as Epic repeatedly pointed out. But it‚Äôs rare for such squabbles to spill over into public view as they did during the trial.</p><p>The trial raised other, more fundamental issues, too. A witness for Epic testified that the operating margin for the App Store <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-trial-witness-on-apple-app-store-profit-211005600.html">was 78 percent</a>, a figure Apple disputed but didn‚Äôt offer evidence to the contrary. Instead, Tim Cook and other execs have maintained they simply <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/381888/Tim_Cooks_gut_says_the_App_Store_is_profitable_but_Apple_wont_back_it_up_with_data.php">don‚Äôt know</a> how much money the App Store makes.</p><p>Cook did, however, have much more to say when pressed on whether game developers effectively ‚Äúsubsidize‚Äù the rest of the App Store. ‚ÄúWe are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store, and we‚Äôre doing that by focusing on getting the largest audience there,‚Äù Cook <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions">stated</a>.</p><p>The argument struck a nerve with some. Marco Arment, a longtime iOS developer whose apps have been featured by Apple, wrote a <a href="https://marco.org/2021/06/03/developer-relations">scathing blog post</a> in response.</p><p>‚ÄúThe idea that the App Store is responsible for most customers of any reasonably well-known app is a fantasy,‚Äù Arment writes. ‚ÄúThe App Store is merely one platform‚Äôs forced distribution gateway, ‚Äòfacilitating‚Äô the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor. For Apple to continue to claim otherwise is beyond insulting, and borders on delusion.‚Äù</p><p>Determining just how many developers agree with that sentiment, though, is trickier. There are millions of iOS developers and for much of the App Store‚Äôs history, most have been reluctant to  publicly criticize Apple. The company has conducted its own surveys ‚Äî as evidenced in the Epic trial disclosures ‚Äî but the findings aren‚Äôt typically made public. And even Cook admitted he was unsure if it‚Äôs a metric the company regularly tracks.</p><p>‚ÄúThere&#39;s not a lot of actual third-party survey on the developer ecosystem,‚Äù says Ben Bajarin, CEO of analyst firm Creative Strategies. He has been conducting his own poll of Apple developers to gauge their feelings toward the company.</p><p>He says he sees ‚Äúa pretty big gap‚Äù between the smaller, independent developers and the larger businesses on the App Store. Developers with smaller projects, he says, are ‚Äúsimply much more reliant on Apple.‚Äù And while they quibble with things like search ads or Apple‚Äôs review process, they don‚Äôt have many alternatives. ‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt developers that have a huge budget for marketing [‚Ä¶] they‚Äôre entirely reliant on Apple to get them customers.‚Äù</p><h2>The coming antitrust battles</h2><p>These issues could end up being much bigger than Epic‚Äôs or a few other high-profile frustrated developers. Regardless of the outcome of the Epic trial, Apple is facing other antitrust battles in the United States and Europe, where many of the same issues are being raised.</p><p>UK regulators <a href="https://www.engadget.com/uk-apple-antitrust-proble-ios-app-store-policies-105131767.html">launched</a> an investigation into the App Store in March. That probe, which came in response to developer complaints, is looking at Apple‚Äôs rules for developers and its policies around in-app purchases. Separately, the European Union is moving forward with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-eu-antitrust-apple-music-spotify-103100952.html">its own</a> antitrust case centered around the company‚Äôs commission structure and anti-steering rules. And earlier this month, US lawmakers, who have also <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/21/senate-antitrust-hearing-apple-tile-spotify-match-epic/">heard</a> from frustrated app developers in recent months, introduced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/house-five-antitrust-bills-apple-google-facebook-amazon-205114170.html">five antitrust bills</a> targeting Apple and its fellow tech giants. One of which would bar Apple from pre-installing <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-16/apple-pre-installed-apps-would-be-banned-under-antitrust-package">any apps</a> on iPhones at all.</p><p>The outcome of any one of these could dramatically reshape how Apple runs the App Store, and the rules it sets for developers.</p><p>On its part, Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-letter-trusted-ecosystem-why-app-store-remain-closed-121242946.html">has argued</a> that opening the App Store would harm users and affect its ability to protect their privacy. Behind the scenes, Cook has reportedly personally lobbied members of Congress <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/22/technology/amazon-apple-google-facebook-antitrust-bills.html">to rethink</a> the proposed legislation.</p><p>Even if Apple is able to emerge from its antitrust fights relatively unscathed, dissatisfied developers could eventually pose a more existential problem for Apple. Bajarin, of Creative Strategies, says that issues with developers are unlikely to hurt Apple in the short term because there are still few alternatives. But, he says, that could change should Apple face competition from an emerging platform it doesn‚Äôt yet dominate, such as AR or VR.</p><p>‚ÄúYou just don&#39;t want this strain on developer relationships because Apple wants all those developers to be right on board day one for whatever&#39;s coming next. They need those larger developers to still prioritize their OS.‚Äù</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-developers-171550382.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">87875387-8b89-417f-86ed-533868a42693</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 17:15:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625074601</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T17:36:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f1d4f9f0-c88e-11eb-bffd-f02dcac56b86" width="3780" height="2556" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/f1d4f9f0-c88e-11eb-bffd-f02dcac56b86" width="3780" height="2556" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/06/07: In this photo illustration the Apple CEO Tim Cook is seen on a mobile phone screen during an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in Cupertino, California, US, in front of Apple logo in the background.

The messaging app is launching a new, Discord-like chat feature <a href="https://slack.com/blog/collaboration/new-tools-to-help-you-work-from-anywhere"><ins>called Huddles</ins></a>. The feature, along with new collaboration tools for sharing pre-recorded audio and video are, according to the company, meant to provide an alternative to the ‚Äúendless stream of meetings‚Äù that have dominated many office workers‚Äô calendars during the pandemic.</p><p>Huddles allows Slack users to create impromptu meetups either in direct messages or an existing channel. When a participant starts a Huddle, other members can quickly join and chat in real time, much like you would in Discord. Though it‚Äôs meant to be ‚Äúcamera-free,‚Äù Huddles does support screen-sharing for an extra layer of collaboration.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Slack says the feature is a good alternative to voice or video calls because it‚Äôs a more low-pressure way for workers to quickly chat without the need to schedule a meeting. Tamar Yehoshua, the company‚Äôs chief product officer, compared Huddles to the kinds of impromptu conversations that happen in offices but don‚Äôt often occur with remote work. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as if you see people congregating in a conference room and you just stick your head in and then leave when you‚Äôre ready,‚Äù she said during a briefing with reporters.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/a8f91260-d93d-11eb-bffb-bf9a98b87f7b" style="height:1400;width:1400;" alt="Slack created native video and screen recording tools with searchable transcripts.

After more than a year working from home, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/online-conferencing-video-chat-fatigue-172357939.html"><ins>Zoom fatigue</ins></a> is real. At the same time, many workers may <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-allows-working-from-home-indefinitely-182153248.html"><ins>never go</ins></a> back to the office ‚Äî at least, not full-time. So it‚Äôs not surprising Slack would respond to these shifts.</p><p>Similarly, the company is also addressing the need to collaborate when everyone isn‚Äôt online at the same time. The <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/1500012915082-Schedule-messages-to-send-later"><ins>‚Äúschedule send‚Äù</ins></a> feature it recently previewed will now be rolling out. And the app is introducing new tools to share videos, voice and screen recordings within Slack.</p><p>While the app already allows users to swap video files within chats, the new tools go a step further. Users can record and share natively within a channel, and other team members can respond with a video or voice recording of their own. They also include live captioning, and both the recording and the accompanying transcription are searchable after the fact.</p><p>Finally, Slack also showed off a new directory tool for its business users called Slack Atlas. The feature adds more information to Slack‚Äôs existing profiles, such as org charts and employee start dates. It can also integrate with existing tools like Workday to automatically pull in relevant details to workers‚Äô Slack profiles.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/slack-huddles-audio-143014019.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cce239a9-f0bd-4674-a8a5-2c1a230794f1</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 14:30:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625014722</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T00:58:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5cc01850-d931-11eb-bf6f-4ff3886977d1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/5cc01850-d931-11eb-bf6f-4ff3886977d1" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Slack]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Channel members can see when there's a huddle in progress.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[slack huddles]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Renault plans to electrify two thirds of its cars by 2025]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Renault has been sending signals that it wants to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-02-renault-morphoz-concept-ev-transformer.html">accelerate its EV plans</a>, and it&#39;s now clear just how aggressive the firm will be. The French automaker now expects 65 percent of its lineup to be electrified by 2025 ‚Äî potentially the &quot;greenest&quot; car mix in Europe, according to the company, and much better than an earlier 30 percent target. Its plans revolve around a lineup with 10 new electric cars, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/renault-5-ev-sustainability-push-120141741.html">reborn 5</a>, the 4ever (a modern Renault 4) and a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/renaults-megane-e-vision-concept-previews-its-future-ev-lineup-085019542.html">M√©gane EV</a>.</p><p>Up to 90 percent of cars in Renault&#39;s brand stable (which includes Alpine and Dacia) should be electric by 2030.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The strategy hinges in part on making EVs more accessible. Renault is prepping a new platform (CMF-BEV) that should reduce costs by a third compared to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-23-renault-zoe-impressions-ev-charging-network-paris-france.html">the Zoe</a> through an interchangeable battery, a &quot;right-sized&quot; 100kW powertrain and borrowed components from conventional cars. Renault is also focusing on more capable and affordable components, including more efficient nickel-manganese-cobalt batteries (with 20 percent more range versus alternatives) and an all-in-one powertrain that&#39;s roughly half as large as before while costing 30 percent less.</p><p>Renault is also hoping to cut the cost of recycling EV batteries to a third of its current levels by 2030, and have its Mobilize brand reuse batteries as stationary energy storage.</p><p>You&#39;ll have to wait a while for some of these cars. The M√©gane arrives in 2022, and Alpine&#39;s &quot;dream garage&quot; will have to wait until 2024. Still, It&#39;s evident Renault wants to earn an eco-friendly reputation much sooner than originally expected.</p><p>Whether or not Renault will lead the pack is another matter. Volkswagen, for instance, <a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/volkswagen-group-set-to-use-platform-model-for-issues-of-the-future-6893">hopes</a> to be the worldwide leader in electric vehicles by 2025 &quot;at the latest,&quot; and wants an all-electric European lineup by 2030. There&#39;s no guarantee rivals will meet their own goals, but Renault may have to tweak its plans again if it&#39;s going to stay ahead in a rapidly changing market.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/renault-electric-vehicle-ev-strategy-2025-142835578.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c62f53ca-0d10-4cd1-bbf2-4dcd71c22972</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 14:28:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625064400</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T14:46:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/0d15ab80-d9a4-11eb-b45c-d5c1691115a5" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/0d15ab80-d9a4-11eb-b45c-d5c1691115a5" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Olivier Martin-Gambier/Renault]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Renault 5 and Megane at the eWays Electro Pop presentation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Renault 5 and Megane at the eWays Electro Pop presentation]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube will stream the UEFA Women‚Äôs Champions League for free]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Soccer fans around the world will be able to watch the UEFA Women&#39;s Champions League for free over the next two seasons. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube"><ins>YouTube</ins></a> will stream every game from the competition in 2021-23.

The Halo band stood out as a screenless $100 wrist-band that required a monthly subscription for the bulk of its functions, and kicked up a ton of controversy with its tone-detecting feature. The company is continuing to deviate from industry trends like squeezing more sensors or adding more workout types and is instead rolling out a smartphone camera-driven service called Movement Health, which it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazons-halo-app-gets-functional-fitness-tests-and-corrective-exercises-130034361.html">announced earlier this month</a>.</p><p>Movement Health is another way Amazon is distinguishing itself from the sea of other fitness offerings. Instead of just tracking your steps, heart rate and sleep, which the Halo wearable does, the app also offers tools like body fat scanning and tone detecting. The latter feature was widely denounced at launch for listening in on all your conversations all the time. Even setting aside those concerns, Tone Detection isn‚Äôt very useful anyway ‚Äî Amazon doesn‚Äôt provide enough context around each entry to help you understand why you sounded ‚Äúangry‚Äù or ‚Äúhappy‚Äù at various points during the day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Amazon Halo general features</h2><p>But as someone who‚Äôs been trying to improve her general fitness and knows that weight is only one of many metrics towards an overall picture of your health, I‚Äôve found the body fat scan helpful. As a recap, Amazon uses your phone‚Äôs camera to take front, back and side pictures of you, then analyzes it to deduce your body fat percentage. The company has cited study after study claiming its computer vision tool is more accurate than scales using bioimpedance, which send a mild electric current through your body. Pennington Biomedical Research Center even goes as far as to <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.10.21258595v1.full.pdf">say that its tests found</a> the Halo app ‚Äúcan be as accurate as the methods doctors use to measure body fat percentage.‚Äù That study, by the way, was funded by Amazon.</p><p>In my own experience with the band over the last few months, Halo&#39;s greatest draw is its app. The device itself, which doesn‚Äôt have a screen, is nondescript and underwhelming. It‚Äôs so plain that I didn‚Äôt even notice it was on a pile of laundry one day and accidentally tossed it into my washing machine. The good thing is that it survived being washed and dried. This might be the Nokia 3310 of wearables.</p><div id="b591367bca0c4a709e3e5f020cb45435"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mkOd5fptPm8?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Just like the old-school phone, the Halo band doesn‚Äôt do much. It houses a heart rate monitor and microphones to track your heart rate and tone (if you opt in). It also has an accelerometer to help it log your steps and sleep, as well as a multi-function button. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with a simple device that just does the basics, except that it costs $100. You could get all these features for a fraction of the price from a plethora of companies without having to pay an additional monthly subscription fee.</p><h2>Movement Health impressions and testing</h2><p>Where Amazon does stand out is in offerings like body fat scanning and Movement Health. The latter, which rolls out today, is intended to ‚Äúimprove the way you move.‚Äù I don‚Äôt like the idea that there‚Äôs something inherently wrong about the way some people move, but if you‚Äôve ever wondered whether your joints might be stiffer than most, or you‚Äôve had issues with back or shoulder pain, Movement Health might help. According to Amazon, it‚Äôs ‚Äúbased on functional fitness, which is your body‚Äôs readiness to execute the everyday movements you do without thinking ‚Äî bending, reaching, lifting, twisting, pulling, pushing and even just walking.‚Äù</p><p>Basically, the Halo app can guide you through a quick mobility test, and through your phone camera it‚Äôll assess your performance. I&#39;ve had it for just under two weeks. On my first attempt, I ran the test on my Pixel 4a, and per the app‚Äôs directions I turned my speaker volume up and set the phone on the ground leaning against a wall. It also suggested I wear form fitting clothes and tie my hair up. Once I framed myself within the outlined boundaries, the app showed an instructor that demonstrated each movement. I‚Äôd recommend using wireless headphones if you can for this part, as I struggled to hear the instructions over street noise in an apartment in Brooklyn.</p><p>The entire session was about 10 minutes long and Halo asked me to do sets of five movements like squats, lunges and overhead reaches ‚Äî both facing the camera and to the side. Each time I successfully performed an action, it chimed and told me to repeat the action (when required). At the end, I got a report saying my performance was ‚Äúgreat, you‚Äôre in the healthy range!‚Äù I scored 94 percent on Mobility and Stability, and 93 percent on Posture.</p><h2>Results and recommended exercises</h2><p>The app also displayed cards on each metric, explaining what they meant and how they related to my physiological performance. Scrolling further down, I also saw a detailed breakdown of things like ‚Äúshoulder mobility,‚Äù ‚Äútrunk stability,‚Äù ‚Äúhip mobility,‚Äù ‚Äúhip stability,‚Äù ‚Äúlower mobility‚Äù and more. According to Amazon, ‚Äúthis assessment delivers comparable accuracy to an in-person assessment with a professional trainer.‚Äù I‚Äôve yet to have a similar assessment with a professional trainer so I can‚Äôt vouch for that claim.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/1d76cda0-d923-11eb-bebf-008eafd8c6c4" alt="Amazon Halo Movement Health app screenshots" data-uuid="5e8d3f7e-dd67-3ec3-8459-a94aae83b1b0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon Halo app screenshots</div></figure><p>Like the body fat scan tool and other Halo features, by the way, Amazon says ‚Äúmultiple layers of privacy and security are built into the service to keep data safe and in your control.‚Äù The assessment videos of you lunging and squatting are ‚Äúencrypted in transit to the cloud, securely processed within seconds and then automatically deleted.‚Äù The company promises that no one ever sees them, whether or not you take Amazon at its word is your decision.</p><p>After analyzing your results, you can also check out the program of ‚Äúcorrective exercises‚Äù that Amazon recommends based on your performance. For me, the system suggested two sets of actions like 45 seconds of shinbox bridge extensions, 60 seconds of side lying t-spine rotation and 40 seconds of hip airplanes, for example. I‚Äôm meant to alternate these and do them at least three days a week for four weeks. Each set has a video led by physical therapist Dr. Kelly Starrett, as well as text laying out the movements. In the videos, Dr. Starrett explained not just how to perform each movement but also what areas it targets and how it helps your general mobility.</p><p>You can set up a schedule and reminders to have Amazon keep you on track via notifications on your phone. The company also recommends that you perform an assessment every two to four weeks, which will likely result in new sets of corrective exercises for you to use. Amazon says ‚Äúif you‚Äôre looking for a little extra burn, you can also see an additional curated list of workout recommendations to provide a higher-intensity alternative.‚Äù</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>As someone who hits the gym or yoga mat three to four times a week, I didn‚Äôt see the need to add these exercises to my routine. Most of the moves are similar to what I get out of my yoga sessions. But if you‚Äôre plagued by joint or back issues, these videos might be a good, gentle way to start working on your mobility in those areas. Of course, this shouldn‚Äôt and can‚Äôt replace a visit to the doctor, but they could be a helpful supplement. So far, Movement Health and the body fat scans seem to be ways Amazon is trying to use its computer vision skills to improve the Halo app, making it much more useful than the band on its own. Too bad having the device tied to your account is a requirement.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-halo-movement-health-hands-on-available-today-130020705.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9910a480-c77c-43cb-b8b1-d35918337151</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 13:00:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625059734</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T13:29:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/02748a90-d9a7-11eb-a41f-3be77b40a7ea" width="1517" height="841" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/02748a90-d9a7-11eb-a41f-3be77b40a7ea" width="1517" height="841" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Amazon Halo app shown on a phone screen next to a wrist-worn wearable.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon Halo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[WhatsApp is rolling out 'view once' messages to Android beta testers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Facebook is diving into ephemeral messaging. After debuting <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-and-messenger-vanish-mode-190042935.html">self-erasing media and texts</a> on Messenger and Instagram, the social giant is rolling out a similar feature on WhatsApp. Starting today, the app&#39;s beta testers on Android have begun to receive a &quot;View Once&quot; mode that wipes photos and videos as soon as you view and dismiss them. You&#39;ll know if you have access to the new feature if you see a dedicated button (that looks like a timer) in the caption input field, according to the experts at <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-rolling-out-photos-and-videos-set-to-view-once/#more-9432"><em>WABetaInfo</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to be confused with WhatsApp&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-disappearing-roll-out-090000380.html">disappearing messages</a> ‚Äî which delete within seven days ‚Äî photos and video sent using view once mode are single-use only and vanish after you close them. You&#39;ll get a notification once your media has been viewed.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite the added sheen of privacy, there are some quirks you should be aware of before jumping in. As noted by <em>WABetaInfo, </em>disabling read receipts won&#39;t stop others from being notified if a view once message has been opened ‚Äî though, you won&#39;t see when a recipient open yours. In groups, you&#39;ll be able to see when members have opened disappearing media even if you have read receipts disabled.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, there&#39;s nothing stopping people from screenshotting your message without you finding out. View once apparently still works if you send a message to someone who doesn&#39;t have access to the feature. Those on iOS will reportedly get the new mode at a later date.</p><p>Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-multi-device-support-soon-132418897.html">announced the feature</a> in June on the heels of its divisive WhatsApp privacy policy update. The tech giant was forced to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-postpones-privacy-policy-facebook-201439528.html">delay</a> the new rules to mid-May from early February following an outcry over its access to additional user data. Facebook also later <a href="https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-wont-limit-accounts-dont-accept-privacy-policy-160132557.html">backtracked</a> on its decision to limit WhatsApp features for those who didn&#39;t accept the changes. The company has previously painted ephemeral messaging as a way to encourage more authentic and intimate conversations.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/whatsapp-android-view-once-messages-124030396.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5857381c-688c-4022-b1a6-104e86267920</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 12:40:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625056303</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T12:31:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/52df3ee0-d99c-11eb-b7be-4e41069427c8" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/52df3ee0-d99c-11eb-b7be-4e41069427c8" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of the messenger app WhatsApp is seen on the screen of a smartphone in New Delhi, India on May 27, 2021.

The search giant has <a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/united-kingdom/further-measures-help-fight-financial-fraud-uk/">announced</a> that starting in the fall it will only run ads for financial products and services from sources that have been cleared by the UK&#39;s financial watchdog.&nbsp;</p><p>Google said it will update its policy from August 30th and begin enforcing the rules a week later on September 6th. At that point, advertisers will have to demonstrate that they are authorized by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) or qualify for its limited exemptions. According to Google, the requirement covers financial products and services that go beyond the regulator&#39;s ambit.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The decision didn&#39;t happen overnight, however. Google has been on the end of mounting criticism from regulators, law enforcement and consumer groups over its perceived lack of action against scrupulous ads. According to trade body <a href="https://www.ukfinance.org.uk/press/press-releases/criminals-exploit-covid-19-pandemic-rise-scams-targeting-victims-online">UK Finance</a>, investment scam cases on search engines saw a 32 percent increase last year. These typically involve criminals duping victims into moving their money to a fictitious fund (such as a pension pot) or to pay for a fake investment. Losses incurred from the fake ads totaled over ¬£135 million.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, the FCA threatened to take legal action against Google and social media companies after it issued 1,200 warnings about fraudulent ads on their platforms, double the amount from 2019. The regulator told a parliamentary committee that it was able to start taking action in the wake of Brexit. In the past, the FCA had been bound by EU rules on financial ads that did not apply to online platforms.</p><p>Others blamed Google&#39;s system for the failings. UK consumer group <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/news/2021/04/two-in-five-victims-of-online-scam-adverts-dont-report-to-host-platforms/"><em>Which?</em></a> found that 51 percent of the 1,870 search engine users it surveyed didn&#39;t know how to report suspicious ads in search listings. The perceived inertia from Google led some lawmakers to claim that it was content to continue profiting from the bogus ads. MPs told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/jun/14/uk-regulator-warns-google-about-accepting-scam-adverts"><em>The Guardian</em></a> that the company was benefiting from online scammers who paid to host ads on its platforms. While the FCA had also paid Google more than ¬£600,000 ($830,000) in 2020 and 2021 to run ‚Äòanti-scam‚Äô ads.</p><p>For its part, Google claims it has improved its ad screening rules using a mix of machine learning and human review. The tech giant removed <a href="https://blog.google/products/ads-commerce/ads-safety-report-2020/">3.1 billion</a> adverts that violated its policies in 2020 according to its ad transparency report. It also began verifying advertisers in January by requiring them to submit legal identification, business incorporation documents and proof of the country in which they operate. Back in 2018, Google followed in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-30-facebook-bans-ads-promoting-cryptocurrencies.html">Facebook&#39;s</a> footsteps by <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-14-google-ban-cryptocurrency-ads-june.html">banning cryptocurrency ads</a>.</p><p>‚ÄúThis new update builds on significant work in partnership with the FCA over the last 18 months to help tackle this issue,‚Äù Ronan Harris, vice president and MD, Google UK and Ireland, said in a blog post. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement reflects significant progress in delivering a safer experience for users, publishers and advertisers. While we understand that this policy update will impact a range of advertisers in the financial services space, our utmost priority is to keep users safe on our platforms ‚Äî particularly in an area so disproportionately targeted by fraudsters.‚Äù</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-financial-ads-uk-regulator-115001895.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9bcdd36-281f-4898-8941-182eb6720298</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 11:50:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625057640</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T12:54:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a2e6b60-bd5b-11eb-b7af-a061aa240238" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a2e6b60-bd5b-11eb-b7af-a061aa240238" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEATTLE, UNITED STATES - 2021/04/27: The Google logo seen at the entrance to Google Cloud campus in Seattle.

They&#39;ll be &quot;jointly developing selected content and exchanging know-how&quot; on both new and existing game properties. &quot;We look forward to combining Bloober Team‚Äôs and our respective characteristics and strengths to create high-quality content,&quot; said Konami President Hideki Hayakawa in a statement.</p><p>The news should perk up the ears of <em>Silent Hill</em> fans hoping for a new chapter. Bloober&#39;s <em>The Medium</em> is also a horror-style game (even using a score from <em>Silent Hill </em>composer Akira Yamaoka) with players flipping between real and afterlife versions of the world.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On top of that, Bloober Team CEO dropped a hint earlier this year that it was working on something interesting. &quot;In fact, we&#39;ve been working for more than a year on another gaming project, another horror IP, and we&#39;re doing this with a very famous gaming publisher,&quot; he told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-18-bloober-team-adding-action-to-its-psychological-horror-focus"><em>Gamesindustry.biz</em></a> in February.  &quot;I can&#39;t tell you who. I can&#39;t tell you what the project is, but I&#39;m pretty sure when people realize we&#39;re working on it, they will be very excited.&quot;</p><p>Nothing about any <em>Silent Hill </em>IP has been confirmed, though, and it&#39;d be understandable if<em>&nbsp;</em>fans remain skeptical. A <em>Silent Hills</em> sequel with Hideo Kojima, Guillermo del Toro and Norman Reedus was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-04-27-silent-hills-hideo-kojima-del-toro-canceled.html">canceled</a> back in 2015 ‚Äî despite the appearance of an impressive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-13-kojima-discusses-collaboration-with-del-toro-for-silent-hills.html">playable teaser</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, the Konami and Bloober Team partnership is a promising development. <em>The Medium</em> generally met with good reviews, though our own Jessica Condit <a href="https://www.engadget.com/medium-xbox-series-s-review-160039546.html">found it</a> a bit &quot;medium,&quot; as it were. The game&#39;s &quot;dual reality&quot; switching was also well done, so if the two companies combine their horror chops and technology, it could result in some compelling IP.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/konami-strategic-partnership-the-medium-developer-bloober-101519819.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f7f88db1-b888-4961-a718-47d1ffacf43f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 10:15:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625048599</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T10:23:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/207900c0-d989-11eb-9d3d-bf4c0536ea4f" width="2600" height="1463" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/207900c0-d989-11eb-9d3d-bf4c0536ea4f" width="2600" height="1463" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Bloober]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Konami enters into 'strategic partnership' with 'The Medium' developer Bloober]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Konami enters into 'strategic partnership' with 'The Medium' developer Bloober]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[AirCar prototype completes its first inter-city flight]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The term flying car is a bit of a misnomer. In order to meet regulatory guidelines, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kitty-hawk-flyer-heaviside-045616682.html/">many</a> of the <a href="https://japanese.engadget.com/toyotabacked-sky-drive-conducts-a-public-flight-test-of-a-flying-car-073058482.html">vehicles</a> currently in development are more like manned drones or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airspeeder-electric-flying-race-car-test-flight-175132594.html">vertical take-off and landing</a> aircraft (VTOL). But, a prototype that just achieved a major milestone actually fits the flying car description.&nbsp;</p><p>A Slovakian company known as Klein Vision recently completed its inaugural inter-city flight between the Nitra and Bratislava airports. At the end of the 35-minute journey, the vehicle&#39;s inventor, professor Stefan Klein, clicked a button to tuck in its wings and drove the car home straight from the tarmac.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="e5d52efbab984777b2befb5081f644ff"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2tDOYkFCYo?rel=0" style="border:0;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The company has been working on its hybrid aircraft for more than 30 years. With 142 successful landings and over 40 hours of test flights under its belt, Klein is convinced that his third prototype is ready to leap past the concept stage. As part of its latest breakthrough, the two-seater AirCar reached a cruising speed of 170km/h, slightly below the max 190km/h. Klein says the car has flown at 8200 ft and achieved steep 45 degree turns as part of its maneuverability testing. Unlike VTOL vehicles, the AirCar requires a runway for takeoff and landing.</p><p>The current prototype is equipped with a 160HP BMW engine with a fixed-propeller and a ballistic parachute. Klein has even bigger plans for its follow-up. He claims the 300HP pre-production model will receive the CS-23 aircraft certification for normal, utility, aerobatic and commuter aeroplanes from European aviation regulators, along with an M1 road permit.</p><p>In reality, getting there could still prove a challenge. The company will have to tread a fine line between a light aircraft and a more substantial vehicle with health and safety precautions built-in. However, there <em>are</em> signs that regulators are coming round to the idea of flying cars. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration recently granted <a href="https://www.flyingmag.com/story/aircraft/terrafugia-transition-faa-slsa-certification/">Terrafugia&#39;s</a> roadable airplane a special certificate in the light sport category (S-LSA), making it legal for flight.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/aircar-first-inter-city-flight-092852060.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">54afa51c-7340-4979-86da-1f7603136c85</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 09:28:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625057556</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T12:53:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/e8580d80-d983-11eb-aefd-87632fd18a64" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/e8580d80-d983-11eb-aefd-87632fd18a64" width="1024" height="576" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Klein Visions]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Klein AirCar]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Klein AirCar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HBO Max expands beyond the US to 39 new territories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As it announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-latin-america-caribbean-release-date-155038331.html">earlier this year</a>, HBO Max is finally moving outside the US, <a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max/hbo-max-rolls-out-39-territories-latin-america-and-caribbean-starting-today">expanding</a> to 39 territories in Latin America and the Caribbean. &quot;With today‚Äôs launch, we are introducing our global platform and providing a brand new user experience to millions of fans across Latin America and the Caribbean,&quot; said HBO Max International head Johannes Larcher in a statement.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike HBO Max in the US, subscribers in those regions won&#39;t have the option of an ad-supported plan.

An external investigation conducted by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/hackers-exploited-0-day-not-2018-bug-to-mass-wipe-my-book-live-devices/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> and <a href="https://censys.io/blog/cve-2018-18472-western-digital-my-book-live-mass-exploitation/">Derek Abdine</a> (CTO at security firm Censys) has revealed, however, that the bad actors exploited another undocumented vulnerability in a file aptly named system_factory_restore.&nbsp;</p><p>Usually, users would have to type in their passwords to be able to perform factory resets on their devices. Indeed, the script in the file contains lines to password protect the reset command. However, someone in  Western Digital &quot;commented out&quot; or, in non-technical parlance, canceled out the command by adding the double / character at the beginning of each line. HD Moore, a security expert, explained to <em>Ars</em> that this doesn&#39;t make things look good for the company. &quot;It‚Äôs like they intentionally enabled the bypass,&quot; Moore said, since the attackers would have to know the format of the script that triggers the reset to exploit the vulnerability.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Devices that were hacked using the CVE-2021-35941 vulnerability were infected with malware, and in at least one case, it was malware that makes a device part of a botnet. Since turning My Book Live storage devices into botnets and then wiping them clean makes no sense, Abdine&#39;s theory is that one hacker exploited the CVE-2021-35941 vulnerability. After that, a second (possibly rival) hacker exploited the previously unknown reset vulnerability to gain control of the devices, which were then made part of a botnet, or to undo the first one&#39;s work.&nbsp;</p><p>Either way, this event just goes to show that the My Book Live storage devices aren&#39;t as secure as anybody would like at this point. Those who still own it should heed Western Digital&#39;s advice and disconnect it from the internet as soon as possible.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/western-digital-my-book-live-factory-reset-two-vulnerabilities-044122712.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3414384c-1900-4e70-9b4e-a62a43870594</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jun 2021 04:41:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1625028070</ingested><modified>2021-06-30T04:41:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/4e5fd930-5f9d-11ea-b5ae-fc08cc74aaf1" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-03/4e5fd930-5f9d-11ea-b5ae-fc08cc74aaf1" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[playb via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close up of Unrecognizable man sitting at desk and working on laptop at night]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Man sitting at desk and working on laptop at night]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Little Tikes made a Peloton-style stationary bike for kids]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Young kids who see their folks on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/peloton-corporate-wellness-134436951.html">Peloton</a> bike and want to join in on workouts will soon have another way to do that. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/little-tikes-smartwatch-kids-tobi-robot-173711237.html">Little Tikes</a> has created a smart stationary bike for children aged three to seven.
