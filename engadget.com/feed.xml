As such, <em>NHL 22</em> marks the &quot;biggest leap forward&quot; for the franchise in terms of gameplay and graphics, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210819005570/en/EA-SPORTS%E2%84%A2-NHL%C2%AE-22-Delivers-a-Breakthrough-Hockey-Experience-Powered-by-the-Frostbite-Engine%E2%84%A2-Arrives-on-Current-Next-gen-Consoles-October-15/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-SP7CEH_PxTjduXJ0SDrbU6qcp-o_pnudlUwsb5apQ1S4gUE65BTfjH3-pSuqdv0gW3cb3F4oTIgUqCPafFkgu67Ap_pA_yJ1XPgPy1DuJnY">according to EA</a>.</p><p>Developer EA Vancouver has seemingly made every stitch of player uniforms visible via high-res graphics. Player models have been overhauled as well. EA says Frostbite enables enhanced spatial awareness, with players having upgraded eye animations and the ability to track and react to what&#39;s going on around them. The publisher is promising &quot;new physically accurate stick interactions&quot; as well.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7d30612367dc4c2e9056c7186ab5a7ee"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RKtpwPUzF0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>A system called Superstar X-Factors brings unique moves to some of the more high-profile hockey pros with abilities based on their real-world traits. For instance, cover star and Toronto Maple Leafs center Auston Matthews&#39; Shock and Awe move allows you to let fly with &quot;exciting shots,&quot; while Andrei Vasilevskiy’s Contortionist ability plays into the Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender&#39;s body-twisting flair to let him pull off impressive saves. Superstar X-Factors will feature in the Franchise Mode, as well as the Be A Pro, Hockey Ultimate Team and World of Chel modes.</p><p><em>NHL 22 </em>is the first game in the series to have dedicated PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions. It&#39;s also coming to PS4 and Xbox One, but the standard edition doesn&#39;t include a free upgrade to the PS5/Series X/S versions through EA&#39;s Dual Entitlement system.</p><p>For that, you&#39;ll need to opt for the X-Factor edition, which includes extra Hockey Ultimate Team (HUT) packs and other bonuses, as well as three days of early access. If you buy the <em>NHL 22 </em>X-Factor edition for PS5 or Xbox Series X/S, you&#39;ll also have access to the respective previous-gen versions. However, the only game progress you can move from previous-gen consoles to PS5 or Xbox Series X/S is your HUT team, and it&#39;s <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/nhl/nhl-22/buy/nhl-22-dual-entitlement-faq">a one-time content migration</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The FIFA and Madden NFL games moved to Frostbite in 2016 and 2017 respectively, so NHL is lagging behind a bit. That said, Frostbite was primarily designed for Battlefield and other first-person shooters. Some EA studios, such as BioWare, have found the engine <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-mass-effect-andromedas-troubled-five-1795886428"><ins>difficult to work with</ins></a> and had to build some of the tools they needed from scratch. That might go some way toward explaining why it took so long to move the NHL franchise over to Frostbite.</p><p><em>NHL 22 </em>will be released on October 15th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nhl-22-trailer-releasedate-ps5-xbox-series-x-frostbite-engine-172025536.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">216c0ce1-7bec-41fb-92eb-6ae0dbb866c8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 17:20:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629392974</ingested><modified>2021-08-19T17:09:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Ice Hockey]]></category><category><![CDATA[National Hockey League]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/68216900-010f-11ec-aab3-ad538265e127" width="1399" height="787" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/68216900-010f-11ec-aab3-ad538265e127" width="1399" height="787" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[EA Vancouver]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NHL 22]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NHL 22]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Galaxy Z Flip 3 review: Samsung's best foldable yet is still a tough sell]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="a4a35e09fb994fb880a69377ccbb6435"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S0Nb3pv0DRg" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>In many ways, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-z-flip-3-hands-on-specs-price-available-now-140057384.html">the Galaxy Z Flip 3</a><em>should </em>be the first foldable for a mainstream audience. It&#39;s basically a regular smartphone you can fold in half and it could appeal to the swaths of people who miss the satisfying snap of a flip phone. Plus, with a price drop, the new Flip now costs about the same as an iPhone or Galaxy S flagship. Samsung’s latest foldable also features a larger external display than its predecessor, making it more useful when closed, and has water resistance for some peace of mind. It’s even got a faster screen than Apple and Google offer and nifty software that makes better use of the screen when you prop it up on a surface. But the question remains, even at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:a more reasonable $1,000" href="https://fave.co/3gch6c6">a more reasonable $1,000</a>, is the Flip 3 good enough to usher foldables into the mainstream or are they still a gimmick?</p><h2>Design and durability</h2><p>One of the most important factors in determining if the Flip 3 is ready for daily use is durability. Samsung used stronger aluminum for the Flip 3’s frame, refined its hinge and made the screen tougher with a new flexible PET protector. I can’t tell exactly how much more durable the Flip 3 is compared to its predecessor, but I have been taking more risks with it. In fact, I consider my placing the Flip 3 (and the Fold 3, for that matter) into my bag along with my keys, laptop and DSLR the bravest thing I’ve ever done during a review.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>I’m mostly worried because of a bad experience when I took the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-15-samsung-galaxy-z-flip-24-hour-test-camera-samples-motorola-razr-comparison.html">original Z Flip out for a day</a>. It vibrated off a table and cracked its corner. I’ve been fairly careful with the Flip 3, but I’ve avoided babying it, and so far it’s survived being tossed into a bag with various sharp objects. While it’s still prone to sliding around due to its glossy glass exterior, it’s yet to fall off anything. I’ve placed it on treadmills, ellipticals, window ledges and restaurant tables and I don’t want to jinx it but: so far my Flip 3 is scratch-free.</p><p>Does that mean it’ll remain pristine a week, a month or even a year from now? Probably not. But as someone who’s cracked her fair share of phone screens, I feel like the Flip 3 is about as sturdy as most glass-covered flagships.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e443b4c0-00f6-11ec-8f7f-3ee177ea0dd6" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 fully open, held vertically in a hand with its screen facing the camera." data-uuid="8672e604-4c18-39b4-93fa-2b64d4adbd74"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>That is, with one exception: Its flexible internal screen is still more likely to break than others, if for no reason other than you’ll invariably end up pushing into some part of it to close the device. I’ve yet to damage the Flip 3’s screen, and I’ve been careful not to push my thumb into the middle of the panel to close the phone, but I’ve been shutting it with some force. Whether the durability is indeed improved is something that’s hard to tell without months of testing or deliberately trying to damage the device, so I might have to revisit this after some time.</p><p>Speaking of closing the phone: Like its predecessor, the Flip 3 isn’t easy to shut with one hand. It <em>can </em>be done, but the hinge is stiff and provides enough resistance to let it stay open at various angles. Unless you have Dwayne Johnson’s hands, you’ll probably need some leverage to open or close the Flip 3.</p><p>Oh and thanks to the IPX8 water resistance, I was a lot less worried about leaving the Flip next to my sink when I washed my face and dripped all over it while reaching for the soap.</p><p>Besides improved durability and a larger external screen, not much has changed between the new Flip and the last generation. They weigh the same 183 grams (6.45 ounces) and the Flip 3 is a hair thicker. Samsung’s also offering a few new color options, including my two favorites: green and lavender. My review unit is a boring cream/off-white, though.</p><p>Phones in the same size and price range like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-12-pro-review-cameras-5g-performance-price-214630744.html">the iPhone 12 Pro</a> Max and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-s21-plus-s21-ultra-first-look-hands-on-150014483.html">Galaxy S21+</a> are slightly heavier and thicker, but not by much. Of course, these devices are dust-resistant and sport triple cameras, while the Flip has just two. The conventional flagships are also not as narrow. But aside from the aspect ratio, the Flip 3 feels very much like a regular smartphone when unfolded. Bonus: It’s more compact when folded in half, which helps it fit into most of my pockets without peeking out. It actually almost reminds me of a pager when closed. Remember those?</p><section data-eng-breakout="a4210a0b68344d1b9a58f11860df9cad" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/30c239c0-00f7-11ec-9fd8-797a1246144d" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 folded, with its Cover Display showing a cartoon animal and the time."></section><h2>A bigger, more useful Cover Display</h2><p>The greatest difference between the Flip 3 and a typical smartphone is that you can close it, which is not only a satisfying means of putting your phone away, but also introduces a new way to interact with the device. The 1.9-inch external screen is four times larger than the previous model, and can show up to four lines of notifications at once. There are currently six widgets available for this window, which Samsung calls the Cover Display. To interact with this panel, you’ll have to first double tap on it, then swipe vertically or horizontally to see your notifications or widgets respectively.</p><p>This was a little confusing initially, as I didn’t know I needed to tap the screen before swiping. But after figuring it out, I’ve come to appreciate it because it prevents accidentally dismissing notifications and skipping songs on Spotify. That’s pretty helpful since I often unintentionally touch the Cover Display when closing the phone or picking it up.</p><p>Most of the time, I leave the Flip 3 closed until I need to reply to a message or when I start browsing my feeds. It’s certainly a lot less distracting to be able to put my phone aside and not have a long list of notifications that I can see from a distance. I initially set all six widgets to appear on my Cover Display, so scrolling sideways would bring up the weather, media controls, Samsung Pay, Health, Calendar and so on.</p><p>While I appreciated having all those options, after a while it became clear three widgets is plenty  — the endless swiping got tiring eventually. The software is also a little buggy at the moment. The alarms widget, for example, will randomly abandon its countdown if you pause and resume it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a7220730-00f7-11ec-877f-cd30e99d43ce" alt="A hand holding the closed Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 with its Cover Display facing the camera." data-uuid="60df54bd-7dde-3300-bb3d-32a38aa253f0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Another feature that sounds great in theory is using your Cover Display as a viewfinder. With the larger panel, you’ll have more room to frame up your selfies on the Flip 3 with the screen closed. I used it to snap a picture with three staff members of my building and while we were able to squeeze everyone in, the novelty wore off quickly.</p><p>The only time I can see preferring the outside screen as a viewfinder is if you need the sharper or wider rear cameras or when you’re really in a hurry and can’t spare the one or two seconds it takes to open the phone. I like that Samsung gives us this option, but even a selfie-obsessed person like me was never in that much of a rush to snap a portrait. Plus, the photos taken this way end up in a strange squarish crop, while those snapped using the main screen as a viewfinder are taller or wider.</p><h2>Internal screen and Flex mode</h2><p>When you’re back on the main screen, aspect ratio is still somewhat of an issue. The Flip 3’s 6.7-inch display runs at 2,640 x 1,080, which comes up to an uncommon 22:9 format. This didn’t cause too many problems — most apps fit nicely on the screen — but every now and then something will overflow. The pop-up dialogs in <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, for example, disappear into the edges of the display and I can barely tap the buttons I need to move on.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/dba5c8c0-00f7-11ec-beb2-ed4299ddc48d" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 held horizontally between two hands, with the screen showing the Settlers of Catan app with " data-uuid="b4684c29-b27b-3671-b283-90a635a09521"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Fortunately, I didn’t encounter this on most of my frequently used apps, but for now Samsung doesn’t have a workaround to help ensure you can see everything on the Flex.</p><p>That’s my main issue with the Flip 3’s internal screen, which is otherwise a lovely canvas for browsing Instagram and YouTube thanks to its flexible AMOLED panel and 120Hz refresh rate. Images were vibrant with deep blacks and high contrast, and the display never stuttered when I scrolled my feeds in a frenzy. Oh I also didn’t mind the crease in the middle — yes it’s noticeable and does cause some distortion, but it doesn’t get in the way of readability. I also like how it felt beneath my thumb as I scrolled past it. It’s like stroking a soft, naked tendon, which is a lot better than it sounds.</p><p>Another update that makes the Flip 3 a better multimedia device than before are its stereo speakers. Now, when you hold it up to watch a video, you’ll hear its audio from both ends. It’s a little too easy to cover the bottom speaker with your hand when holding the phone horizontally, though.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/0b4e8f30-00f8-11ec-afef-ec57a35b496e" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 folded to prop itself up on a table, with the top half of its screen showing a YouTube video and the bottom showing the title, likes, dislikes, channel, top comment and suggested videos." data-uuid="6bb984da-d64e-3147-942b-d91190dc65e4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Something else the Flip offers that regular smartphones don’t is a Flex mode that kicks in when you half-fold the device. This only works on some apps, like Gallery, Camera and YouTube, where the screen is split in half to show your photo, viewfinder or video on top and navigation, controls or more info at the bottom. When you set the Flip 3 up on a table in Flex mode, you can watch your show as if it were full screen on the top half, while scrolling comments or suggested videos below.</p><p>I thought I’d only find Flex mode useful with the Flip 3 sitting on a table (propped up like it has its own kickstand), but it actually was more helpful in enabling one-handed use. Because the screen is so tall, some elements are out of my thumb’s reach. Flex mode makes scrolling pictures in my gallery or snapping a picture much easier with one hand. So far, though, only a handful of apps support this, so Samsung will need to work harder to make more of them compatible.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>The Flip 3’s dual 12-megapixel cameras hold their own against the likes of the Pixel 5 and iPhone 12 Pro. While Samsung, Apple and Google all have minor differences in the color temperature of their photos, they deliver similar quality and clarity in most situations. The Flip 3’s picture of a yummy bowl of noodles was just as bright and vibrant as those taken with the Pixel and iPhone, though it’s a little soft and failed to capture some detail on the ceramic surface.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9e42f380-00f8-11ec-9f6e-75cb94987b1f" alt="A close up of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3&#39;s Cover Display and dual 12-megapixel cameras next to it." data-uuid="63cc2bea-cb10-349b-af5a-b0af50cf887c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Photos the Flip 3 shot at night are also similar to those from the competition — you’d need to really scrutinize minor exposure and noise differences to tell them apart. The pictures I snapped of a dog park and the city skyline at night all came out bright and colorful, though Google delivered a better closeup of the New York City nightscape thanks to its superior processing software.</p><p>The selfies captured by the Flip 3’s 10-megapixel camera were also bright and sharp. And, based on an informal poll on my Instagram, the majority of my followers preferred a portrait shot by the Flip 3 to the Pixel 5.</p><section data-eng-breakout="881a9243ddf54db79e4e9b4e4c2b7d57" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d1969980-00f8-11ec-ba9f-8771adb574e7" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 unfolded in someone&#39;s hand, with its rear facing the camera"></section><h2>Living the foldable life: In use and battery</h2><p>With a Snapdragon 888 processor and 8GB of RAM, the Flip 3 performed smoothly during my testing. I haven’t encountered many delays when using the main screen to message my friends, post to Twitter and browse websites. It didn’t let up even as I recorded the screen while using the camera to capture footage of my friends trying to perform TikTok dances, either.</p><p>Occasionally, I felt like websites were scrolling more slowly than I was used to, and there are still some small software bugs (like the Cover Display’s alarm widget) that make the Flip 3 feel like it needs a bit more polish. But aside from these minor gripes and the fact that you can fold it, this phone feels very similar to its Samsung siblings.</p><p>That is, until we consider battery life. The Flip 3 never made it through a full day before needing a charge, and that runtime dropped when I enabled the Always On Display for the outer screen. Despite offering a larger Cover Display and a higher refresh rate on its main panel, the Flip 3’s 3,300mAh battery is the same size as its predecessor, which might explain its disappointing endurance. Meanwhile, the S21’s 4,000mAh cell typically stuck around for a day and a half, while the latest Pixels and iPhones easily outlast the Flip 3.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/423d19c0-00f9-11ec-bdd7-634abf3e7174" alt="The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 folded and propped up in tent mode on a table." data-uuid="2e07df85-cb93-324a-9610-12f3638b8601"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>After spending some time with the Flip 3 in the real world, I’ve come to realize a few things: I like being able to fold a phone, put it away and focus on work or living in the moment. But I can also turn a regular phone face down to do that. I enjoy the nostalgia and novelty of closing the Flip 3 when I’m mad at a caller or an app, too.</p><p>In general, the satisfaction and space savings from being able to fold a phone in half are not worth paying a premium for. The good news is that with the Flip 3, Samsung isn’t charging a hefty premium or making many compromises. Battery life is an unfortunate victim of the Flip 3’s larger external screen, but it’s at least not so short that you’ll need to charge it twice a day.</p><p>Ultimately, the Flip 3 is proof that Samsung can deliver a good phone with a foldable display at a relatively reasonable price. It’s also a satisfying upgrade from its predecessor, thanks to its water resistance and bigger outside screen. The most important question now is: Who should buy this? If you pride yourself on being an early adopter and want to get on the foldables bandwagon before they become more common, that might be you. The Flip 3 is a device capable of being a daily driver for those nostalgic or curious enough to buy one. But for a more mainstream audience, there simply aren’t enough benefits yet.&nbsp;</p><p>The Z Flip 3 is a satisfying upgrade from the original, thanks to water resistance and a larger, more useful Cover Display. Its $1,000 starting price puts it in the same class as flagships from Apple, Google and Samsung itself, too. While it mostly behaves like a regular modern smartphone that you can fold in half, the Flip 3 is held back by battery life and potential durability issues.</p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs</h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: Snapdragon 888 or 5nm 64-bit octa-core processor (2.84Ghz + 2.4GHz + 1.8GHz)</p><p><strong>RAM / Storage</strong>: 8GB with 128/256GB storage</p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Main display</strong>: 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED Infinity Flex Display</p><p><strong>Main display resolution</strong>: 2,640 x 1,080 (22:9)</p><p><strong>External display</strong>: 1.9-inch Super AMOLED</p><p><strong>External display resolution</strong>: 260 x 512</p><p><strong>Rear (or external) cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.8 wide-angle camera with OIS and 78-degree FOV, 12MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (123-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Front (or inside) camera</strong>: 10MP f/2.4 camera (80-degree FOV)</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: Android 11 with One UI</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: 3,300mAh</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: USB-C with fast wired charging at 15W (QC2.0 and AFC) and fast wireless charging at 10W (WPC and PMA).

The latest trailer doesn&#39;t reveal too much about the story, but it has some impressive visuals.&nbsp;</p><p>The clip features a elevator that, according to showrunner David S. Goyer, stretches around 26 miles into space. There&#39;s also a floating visualization of a supercomputer that takes design cues from a Möbius strip. Goyer told <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/foundation-exclusive-trailer-breakdown-with-showrunner-david-s-goyer"><em>IGN</em></a> that he challenged his production team to find a look that didn&#39;t remind viewers of Star Wars or Star Trek, perhaps the two biggest linchpins of science fiction.

Based on a series of Isaac Asimov novels, <em>Foundation </em>centers around a group of exiles who try to protect the future of civilization after leader Dr. Hari Seldon (Jared Harris) uses data to predict the fall of the Galactic Empire. What&#39;s left of the Empire isn&#39;t too thrilled about that, and it tries to suppress Seldon&#39;s group.</p><p>The story plays out over the course of a millennium. The first season will run for 10 episodes, with the first two episodes dropping at the same time and the remainder hitting Apple TV+ on a weekly basis.</p><p>Apple TV+ has more sci-fi projects on the way. <em>Invasion</em>, oddly enough, is a series about an alien invasion. It debuts <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tv-plus-invasion-trailer-222925428.html"><ins>on October 22nd</ins></a>. A couple of weeks later, on November 5th, Apple will release <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-tom-hanks-finch-release-date-085915154.html"><em><ins>Finch</ins></em></a>, a movie starring Tom Hanks as an inventor who hits the road with his dog and a robot.

It will be available worldwide on August 31st.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ba27bc30-fc33-11eb-ad37-a3f0ab33e37d" alt="Dell" data-uuid="533330fb-5e12-35be-aea4-0f139b8c3bd8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>The 27-inch monitors include a 4K model with a 60Hz refresh rate that is the priciest of the lot at $620.

Like several of the other newcomers, the S2722QC comes with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-ultrasharp-u2720q-gadget-irl-150013237.html">USB-C</a> port that can receive a display and data signal plus deliver enough power (up to 65W) to charge your laptop.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6d06b5a0-fc33-11eb-bfef-7dbc7b722402" alt="Dell" data-uuid="107b35cd-8dfb-3cd8-91fe-fe0c4977d0d0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p>If you&#39;re on a tighter budget, there&#39;s also a $500 27-inch display dubbed the S2722DC, which essentially swaps 4K for QHD visuals with a higher 75Hz refresh rate. Both screens arrive August 19th. For $100 more, you can grab some neat extras for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dell-video-conferencing-monitors-2021-140016646.html">video calls</a> on the 27-inch S2722DZ, including a pop-up 5-megapixel camera, noise-cancelling mics and dual 5W speakers. If you don&#39;t mind settling with full HD instead of QHD, then the 24-inch S2422HZ offers similar specs for $440. The two displays will come to North America first on September 7th followed by the rest of the world from October 12th.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/aa94c420-fc33-11eb-bb09-d286497e1a90" alt="Dell" data-uuid="cc9ec366-0ed1-3879-bf8c-d71597d00499"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Dell</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dell-monitors-portable-second-screen-130029478.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cd9b6afd-ce02-49c7-bde4-d7b00cc43b3d</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 13:00:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629378788</ingested><modified>2021-08-19T16:31:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fbe9c770-ff54-11eb-bf5f-d70b605a4ad6" width="1280" height="853" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fbe9c770-ff54-11eb-bf5f-d70b605a4ad6" width="1280" height="853" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Dell]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cricket customers will get free HBO Max, if they don't mind ads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You won&#39;t have to spring for AT&amp;T&#39;s regular phone service if you want <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-price-availability-movies-shows-140049904.html">HBO Max</a> tacked on to your plan — provided you&#39;re wiling to make some sacrifices. The carrier&#39;s Cricket Wireless brand has revealed that it will provide free HBO Max service to customers using its $60 per month Unlimited plan if they&#39;re willing to live with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-ad-supported-plan-details-release-date-165738658.html">ad-supported tier</a>. This isn&#39;t as sweet as what you&#39;ll get at AT&amp;T proper, but it will give you a chance to catch up on shows without pricier wireless service or a separate Max subscription.</p><p>The offer will be available to both new and current customers starting on August 20th.

The telecom will likely still own WarnerMedia <a href="https://www.engadget.com/warner-bros-discovery-185439134.html">until 2022</a>, and this gives it a chance to boost both Cricket and HBO Max until that split happens. It could help the company maintain or increase plan prices, too. Nonetheless, you might appreciate this if you&#39;re looking to save money.

Some model year 2024 vehicles, which should start arriving in 2023, will be the first GM models equipped with 5G.

The retailer plans to open several large physical locations in the US akin to department stores, according to anonymous sources cited by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-retail-department-stores-11629330842"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>. The new stores — the first of which will come to Ohio and California — will sell clothing, household items and electronics from &quot;top consumer brands.&quot; Obviously, shoppers can also expect to run into Amazon&#39;s own-brand products, too.</p><p>While the sites are tipped to be around the third of the size of a typical department store at 30,000 square feet, they&#39;ll still be much larger than Amazon&#39;s other physical locations. The move sees the company expanding into an area it originally disrupted as it grew into an all-in-one online shopping destination.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With their sales already <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/21717536/department-store-middle-class-amazon-online-shopping-covid-19">plummeting</a>, the pandemic sealed the fate of several high-profile department stores. The likes of J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus Group have filed for bankruptcy along with other big names in the sector. Though some were thrown a lifeline when they managed to attract new owners.&nbsp;</p><p>Amazon, on the other hand, has seen its fortunes skyrocket during the pandemic as it profited from an increasing shift toward e-commerce. Its booming business even helping to bankroll founder Jeff Bezos&#39; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bezos-space-flight-blue-origin-quotes-204210894.html">trip into space</a>.</p><p>Amazon&#39;s move into physical retail predates the virus, however. The company started with brick and mortar bookstores back in 2015, later acquiring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-06-16-amazon-buying-whole-foods.html">Whole Foods</a> for $13.4 billion in 2017. More recently, it opened cashierless <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Amazon%20Go">Amazon Go</a> stores in the US and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-go-store-uk-084721065.html">UK</a>. Not to mention its highly-curated <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-01-amazon-4-star-store-colorado.html">Amazon 4-star</a> stores and Amazon Pop-Ups inside malls.</p><p>The larger stores are apparently viewed as a way of letting shoppers try before they buy, which is particularly useful for things like apparel. That&#39;s an area where Amazon has historically struggled. As the <em>WSJ</em> notes, the only high-fashion label on its online store is Oscar de la Renta. It also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-13-nike-ending-retail-pilot-amazon.html">lost a major seller in Nike</a> in 2019, which decided to go it alone in e-commerce — a move that has <a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/nike-q-4-2021-earnings-165843774.html">paid off</a> for the sneaker company.</p><p>Amazon&#39;s department stores would also allow it to showcase its range of electronics, from its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Fire%20TV">Fire TVs</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-new-fire-hd-10-tablets-plus-kids-pro-130029307.html">tablets</a> to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-show-10-review-130012759.html">Echo speakers</a> to its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-floodlight-camera-radar-birds-eye-view-133002075.html">Ring</a> home security range, and even its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-fire-tv-133058253.html">Luna</a> cloud gaming service.

A Nintendo Direct event yesterday gave us a better look at <em>Pokémon: Legends</em>, a new spin-off title from the Pocket Monster universe. Combining the cute monsters with feudal Japan aesthetics is a fun twist, and it looks like <em>Legends </em>will offer a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pokemon-brilliant-diamond-shining-pearl-trailer-details-art-style-161620641.html https://www.engadget.com/...">different kind of battle system</a>. Battles are still turn-based, but rather than Pokémon each taking a turn and trading blows, their stats and equipped items dictate the order of actions.</p><p>Each Pokémon&#39;s four moves has two styles: agile style and strong style.

Sure, they can go on too long, be scheduled far too often and distract from your core work. But even before the pandemic made them an exotic memory, I always loved the energy of being in a room with other people, finding the same creative wavelength, working towards a common goal. There&#39;s no video chat app that can replicate that. So, what about VR?</p><p>We&#39;ve already seen companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spatial-ar-vr-meetings-free-oculus-quest-100008450.html">Spatial take a stab at virtual meetings</a>, where you can chat with others, inspect objects and even explore 3D environments from the comfort your home with a VR headset. Now Facebook&#39;s Oculus is <a href="https://www.oculus.com/blog/workrooms/">entering the fray with Horizon Workrooms</a>, an ambitious attempt to capture the best aspects of in-person meetings for Oculus Quest 2 users.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="657ac916-9645-4dd3-8b95-5483103c34cb"/><p>To be clear, Workrooms <em>isn&#39;t</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-oculus-vr-hands-on-170017517.html">Facebook Horizon</a>, its long-awaited multiplayer VR playground. But it is part of the company&#39;s overall vision for the Horizon universe, one entirely devoted to collaborating in meeting rooms and classrooms. And despite being so focused, it&#39;s still a showpiece for Facebook&#39;s VR ambitions, tapping into the company&#39;s expressive avatars, spatial sound, hand tracking and mixed-reality capabilities. You&#39;ll even be able to stream your PC desktop in VR to take notes or goof off during meetings (just like real life!).</p><div id="274f6bcab9294e039d8bacf6c00f9fc9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lgj50IxRrKQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>After spending an hour in a Horizon Workrooms demo, it&#39;s clear that Facebook still has plenty of work left to do. There were a few connection issues, avatar glitches and at one point I got booted out entirely. But when it was running smoothly, it was the closest I&#39;ve felt to being in an live meeting since March of last year.</p><p>But let me start from the beginning. After creating a Workrooms account, I installed the PC companion app and the Workrooms Quest 2 app. Once I booted it up in VR, I was surprised that it recommended putting my controllers down and enabling the Quest 2&#39;s hand-tracking. Outside of demos for that feature, I can&#39;t think of any Oculus apps that have done the same. After that, I customized a goofy avatar — an idealized version of myself with purple hair and no beer belly — and mapped out the edge of my desk so Workrooms can accurately place me in front of virtual tables.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd3a0380-00b3-11ec-9fae-25e7c8de8969" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms" data-uuid="b577c2b5-99bc-345f-8a43-90a665e66466"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>As soon as I hopped into my Horizon Workrooms demo, it was instantly clear why Oculus recommended hand-tracking. I waved to a PR rep, and as I struggled to unmute myself, I was able to throw a thumbs up to confirm I was hearing her. I shouted hello to CNET&#39;s Scott Stein, who was sitting a few seats away, and his audio sounded appropriately far off. We all spent way too much time staring at our hands and testing the limits of the Quest 2&#39;s finger tracking capabilities (for the record, rolling your hands over each other like a wannabe raver can easily scramble things).</p><p>Even though I was in a swanky virtual room, with a stylized deer head wearing VR goggles on the wall, and ceiling-tall windows overlooking expansive lake and mountain rage somewhere in the Pacific Northwest, sitting desk-side with others felt vaguely normal. We made small talk about our families and our vastly different locations (including folks in California, New Jersey, London and myself in Atlanta). I could see who was working on Macs and PCs, based on the virtual accessories in front of them. And along the wall there were also video feeds from other Facebook reps calling in from their PCs, which reminded me of the enormous video conferencing screens in many meeting rooms.</p><section data-eng-breakout="914d48ea957a4bc6af6047f91aa9ad21" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd4463c0-00b3-11ec-a8fb-bb128f10ddf0" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms" data-uuid="883fab42-0f0d-3b6d-9533-944cd1a0fcd7"></section><p>To see my keyboard and mouse, I hit a button to enable pass-through mode, which projected grey-scale footage of my actual desk inside of Workrooms&#39; VR environment. It wasn&#39;t crystal clear, but it was enough to touch-type notes in Evernote by streaming my PC desktop. If you&#39;re running an Apple Magic Keyboard or a specific Logitech model, you&#39;ll also be able to see your keyboard in VR, so you won&#39;t have to deal with the pass-through video.</p><p>Andrew Bosworth, Facebook&#39;s head of VR and AR, said during the demo that he believes there&#39;s &quot;something missing&quot; with video calling, and that there&#39;s a strong pull towards VR collaboration apps as a solution. Of course, that&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect Facebook&#39;s VR lead to say. But he has a point.</p><p>Video calls are a fantastic way for seeing people and maintaining social connections. But when it comes to getting work done, they can get old fast. Everyone&#39;s audio comes in from one channel; it&#39;s hard to make eye contact in large group chats; and the entire session just lives on your computer or phone screen. There&#39;s no sense of actually being in a space with others. Bosworth says that Facebook has been using Workrooms internally for about six months, and he&#39;s noticed some clear benefits. In particular, he can remember specific meetings better thanks to the immersion of sitting beside people in VR with realistic spatial audio.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd43c781-00b3-11ec-bc7f-3e3187174104" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms" data-uuid="7fce8d84-8e8c-35a1-ad85-deadd064dff8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>Of course, virtual reality can also make meetings awkward in entirely new ways. I quickly learned that I couldn&#39;t look closely at someone&#39;s avatar if they were sitting nearby, because it actually felt like I was staring at them. I couldn&#39;t reach for a cup of water on my real-world desk, because it was sitting in front of my neighbor&#39;s virtual space. I also had to be careful about where I placed my hands, because the Quest 2&#39;s hand tracking could make things look... suspect, if they&#39;re under your desk.</p><p>All of that awkwardness culminated when Mark Zuckerberg crashed our demo and sat in the virtual chair beside me. He sketched out his overall vision for Horizon as a stepping stone for his metaverse ambitions. But as he was speaking, I was also trying hard to keep my virtual cool: Don&#39;t stare! Don&#39;t be weird with your hands! Pay attention and be respectful! I thought I was doing pretty well in the heat of the moment, but a recording of our session looked like I was performing some sort of interpretive dance beside the world&#39;s fifth richest man. (Thankfully, that footage isn&#39;t meant for public consumption.)</p><p>Zuckerberg only stopped by for a few minutes, but the fact he made an appearance at all is telling. Workrooms isn&#39;t some side project: It&#39;s a significant component of what he wants Facebook to become. You can see that in the app&#39;s more ambitious features, like a whiteboard that can grow as long as you&#39;d like. You can sketch out thoughts by holding your Oculus controller straight up, so that you can use the end like a massive pen. And if you want to stretch your legs, you can assign a blank wall in your room to serve as your life-sized whiteboard. You can also change the size and layout of your workspace at will, allowing you to move from a circular conference table to something that resembles a classroom.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd391920-00b3-11ec-b7f7-7424f1ebcef7" style="height:1278;width:2000;" alt="Facebook Horizon Workrooms" data-uuid="71a90691-0de0-3c9a-886b-48e86cfffa71"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>Perhaps because Zuckerberg wants Workrooms to be a success, the company is also making it more accessible to people who don&#39;t want Facebook accounts. You can join a session via video chat by creating a Workrooms account, which is separate from Oculus and Facebook logins. If you want to enjoy the experience in VR, though, you&#39;ll need a Facebook account to use the Quest 2. Maybe letting people peek at the 2D Workrooms experience could encourage them to go virtual.</p><p>The company is also being up-front about security and privacy, saying that it won&#39;t use conversations or materials from Workrooms sessions to inform Facebook ads. You&#39;ll also be able to report individuals and entire groups if they&#39;re harassing you or violating community standards. That was a major concern when I <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-oculus-vr-hands-on-170017517.html">demoed Facebook Horizons last year</a>; the idea of a VR playground sounds great, but how do you make it safe for <em>everyone</em>?&nbsp;</p><p>If anything, Horizon Workrooms tells us that Zuckerberg&#39;s metaverse ambitions are more than just marketing fluff. He paid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-25-facebook-oculus-vr-2-billion.html">$2 billion for Oculus</a>, after all, and Facebook has continually invested in VR development and content. You don&#39;t spend that sort of money if you don&#39;t have a vision for the future.&nbsp;</p><p>When he stopped by our demo, Zuckerberg told us he used to scribble code in his notebook during middle school. As soon as he got home, he would type it up with the hopes of building an immersive world to hang out with friends. Workrooms isn&#39;t the perfect VR collaboration solution yet, but it could be the start of what the younger Zuckerberg envisioned. After all, the metaverse won&#39;t be built in a day.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-horizon-workrooms-oculus-vr-meeting-collaboration-110018369.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0c3009f3-c93d-419e-89aa-d7e3b04db07a</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 11:00:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629354699</ingested><modified>2021-08-19T06:31:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd398e50-00b3-11ec-baf6-8cf3ffd51f1f" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd398e50-00b3-11ec-baf6-8cf3ffd51f1f" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Horizon Workrooms]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook Horizon Workrooms]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Splitgate', the FPS with portals, has shot past 10 million downloads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Splitgate</em>, a frenetic free-to-play arena shooter with portals, has become a word of mouth hit with 10 million downloads in under 30 days. Developer 1047 Games has announced that the game will remain in open beta indefinitely as it works on managing the sudden influx of players. As a result, <em>Splitgate </em>is no longer slated to fully launch this month. Instead, 1047 will continue to roll out updates and fixes to the game complete with new content and improvements to the backend that can facilitate the uptick in players. Queue times are now less than 10 minutes and a new Ranked Duos mode recently went live.</p><p><em>Splitgate </em>injected the tired arena shooter with a much needed blast of vitality by adding portals to the mix. Players can cast these wormholes around the map and even shoot opponents through them. It helps that it&#39;s free-to-play, contains a variety of guns and plenty of game modes (like Team deathmatch, Team Shotty Snipers and Team SWAT).&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the game has been in early access since 2019, it exploded in popularity in the wake of its open beta launch in early July, which brought with it cross-play with Xbox and PlayStation consoles. According to 1047, the shooter went from an initial 4,000 concurrent players to more than 175,000 in a few weeks. Naturally, the massive increase caused backend issues. <em>Splitgate</em> was taken offline twice in recent weeks as the small 1047 team worked on server optimizations.&nbsp;</p><div id="268f6b2cf136416c86ce52e43e469382"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nil86RfgEFE?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In late July, the developer announced that it had <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-07-26-spiltgate-developer-1047-games-raises-usd10m-in-funding">raised</a> $10 million in a recent funding round led by Human Capital on top of the $6.5 million it snagged earlier in the year. 1047 said it would put the money toward expanding its engineering team. The company also has a major announcement in store for Gamescom later this month as it looks to build on <em>Splitgate</em>&#39;s breakout success. In a recent Q&amp;A session on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1113426127">Twitch</a>, the developer <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/gaming-news/splitgate-developer-says-switch-port-is-absolutely-part-of-the-vision-3018747">reportedly</a> mentioned that a Switch and mobile port of the game was &quot;part of the vision.&quot;</p><p>“This has been the most surreal time of my life,” said Ian Proulx, CEO and co-founder of 1047 Games. “The fan support has been incredible as we work to improve the player experience. We never dreamed of having to scale this big this quickly, and as a result we have had to overcome challenges to keep up with player demand. We met several major milestones in a short time, creating a stable platform where fans can expect to find a server to play on relatively quickly, and I’m proud of what our team has accomplished - but there’s a lot more to come!”</p><p>Proulx continued, “In looking at the issues facing the scalability of the game’s backend, the process includes far more than simply dealing with server capacity. We are focused on keeping the game stable for fans, and iterating on the game’s concurrent capacity in order to minimize player wait times. We want to do this the right way, and we want to be prepared for massive scale when we officially launch, all the while continuing to improve the beta with frequent updates, additional features, and improvements to server capacity.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-10-million-downloads-100924991.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7afed1df-42e2-44c6-a31a-fa19ed252d53</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 10:09:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629387673</ingested><modified>2021-08-19T15:41:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64052140-00d3-11ec-bfdf-8cd81a375c25" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/64052140-00d3-11ec-bfdf-8cd81a375c25" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Splitgate]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Splitgate]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Splitgate]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Lower Decks' is an indictment of Abrams and Kurtzman-era Star Trek]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The following contains spoilers for season two, episode two of &#39;Star Trek: Lower Decks.&#39;</em></p><p>I’ve been a Star Trek fan for most of my life, and yet I still chuckled at this <em>Onion</em> video released after the first J.J. Abrams installment came out back in 2009: “Trekkies Bash New Star Trek Film As &#39;Fun, Watchable.’” Star Trek isn’t to a lot of people’s taste, J.J. Abrams’ among them. He’s said in interviews <a href="https://youtu.be/-mSM5BCUhZ4">he never really liked Trek</a> and was trying to make it more like Star Wars. (This was six years before <em>The Force Awakens</em> came out.) The reboot films were a breath of fresh air after four years of no original Trek content, and they did get some new fans into the franchise. Some of those novices would later dip their toe into the water of TV Trek and found that they did actually enjoy it a lot, despite its slower pace.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="07d158d2cd0a4bd1b7058f69d3a89386"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/02LgdXVkXgM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>However, despite the franchise’s strong TV track record with shows like <em>TNG</em> and <em>DS9</em>, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Paramount+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Paramount+" href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/5bM07o">Paramount+</a> era has been taking its cues from the Abrams films, which isn’t surprising with executive producer Alex Kurtzman <a href="https://www.engadget.com/cbs-alex-kurtzman-star-trek-deal-165454180.html">at the helm</a>. Alongside Roberto Orci, he’s one of the two screenwriters behind 2009 <em>Star Trek</em> and 2013’s <em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em>, as well as a J.J. Abrams collaborator on <em>Alias</em> and <em>Fringe</em>. Given the box office numbers of the Abramsverse films it makes sense to put him in charge, but it still made a lot of long-time Trekkies groan as we had hoped for a return to the kind of shows we grew up on.</p><p>After three seasons of heavy action on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-season-3-trailer-040651412.html"><em>Discovery</em></a> and the jaded grimdark of season one of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-25-star-trek-picard-technology-evolution.html"><em>Picard</em></a>, the first season of <em>Lower Decks</em> injected some levity back into the franchise, with parody that went up to, but not quite over the line. It couldn’t, since it was intended to be canon. It had to fit alongside <em>TNG</em>, <em>DS9</em> and <em>Voyager</em>. So it packed in plenty of references to keep the wiki addicts over at the Star Trek-centric <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Portal:Main">Memory Alpha</a> busy, while indulging in old tropes like drunk Klingons, arena battles and the occasional omnipotent being. It also took some direct swipes at the live action Trek shows, like how crew members always seem to die in the most low-tech ways like being impaled by spears or how <em>of course</em> the holodeck is used for sex stuff.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/11622440-f94b-11eb-b0ff-780b000ec0ae" data-uuid="5297f039-4213-32d1-96da-cfb8243d6086"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>But those references were always in a more general sense, framed in a “wouldn’t X be ridiculous” way that only long-term fans with deep knowledge of the franchise would fully understand. Until this week’s episode, that is, where crew members of the <em>USS Titan</em> specifically call out the Enterprise D and its galactic cruise ship mentality. Shakespearean plays and string quartets? Peace conferences? How utterly boring compared to the constant run-and-gun that the <em>Titan</em> seems to have been stuck in since last season. They judge the value of their work based on how exciting it is, and think that William Riker must have been bored to tears being stuck on that ship for seven years.</p><p>Of course, <em>TNG</em> fans know it was anything but boring for Riker. He’s been locked in a mental institution, trapped in an alternate future and even had god-like powers for an episode. And he <em>likes</em> performing in jazz concerts with his trombone!</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/40a91ba0-f94b-11eb-aede-d8c58bddfe3f" alt="Pictured: Jonathan Frakes as Captain William T.

The Titan’s pursuit of the dangerous Pakleds has the young lieutenant junior grade in a constant state of panic as he mans the flight conn position, a big change from quietly toiling away on the lower decks of his old ship. But he’s recognized that this is where the opportunities for promotion are, and soon finds himself on an undercover mission with his fellow bridge crew. At least, it’s supposed to be undercover — the other <em>Titan</em> members quickly get them embroiled in a shootout and facing certain death.</p><p>That’s when Boimler takes the opportunity to tell his crewmates how he really feels. “I’d love to be in a string quartet. I love that when Riker was on the Enterprise he was out there jamming on the trombone and catching love disease and acting in plays and meeting his identical transporter clone Thomas. That stuff might not seem as cool as what you guys do, but it’s Starfleet, all the way.” His confession elicits similar confessions from the other team members, before they manage to find a way out in classic technobabble fashion.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5777bb20-f94b-11eb-9dff-936597267ea8" data-uuid="7f80e5a7-3ea1-35c2-aa82-2e448be034a4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p>For years Star Trek has always danced around the question of whether Starfleet was a military force. It employs naval ranks and the ships are outfitted with phasers and photon torpedoes for defense. But its stated purpose was exploration and other activities that help tie the vast Federation together. The Abrams films spent all their time reacting to one crisis after another — the crew didn’t start an actual mission of exploration until the very end of <em>Beyond</em>, and there hasn’t been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-movie-2023-paramount-pictures-schedule-190520920.html">another film</a> since to follow up on that.</p><p>Both <em>DS9</em> and <em>Discovery</em> engaged in wars with the Klingon Empire. On <em>Enterprise</em> the crew ended up hunting down the Xindi with a cadre of trained soldiers on board for its third season. Even <em>Voyager</em> had to deal with the constant accusations that they were a conquering force as they struggled to get home. <em>Lower Decks</em> is our first look in a while at a Starfleet dedicated to exploration, with the crew of the <em>Cerritos</em> specializing in “second contact,” that is, getting communication and trade set up with the planets that flashier ships like the Enterprise meet in their adventures.&nbsp;</p><p>So <em>Lower Decks</em> has always been a sort of commentary on the greater Star Trek philosophy, but it’s never been as blatant as Brad Boimler saying, “I didn’t join Starfleet to get in phaser fights. I signed up to explore, to be out in space making new discoveries and peaceful diplomatic solutions. That’s boldly going.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e1a5350-f94b-11eb-9f6d-8e3958dfdc6d" data-uuid="308ce374-a787-3385-9bb5-d6713edb4571"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">CBS</div></figure><p><a href="https://www.theonion.com/trekkies-bash-new-star-trek-film-as-fun-watchable-1819594814"><em>The Onion video</em></a> takes old school Trek fans to task for being gatekeepers, for wallowing and fetishizing things that other folks find boring. The new era of Trek has stretched the definition of what Star Trek could be, expanding into new genres and injecting a little action to sate the appetites of modern audiences. But <em>Lower Decks</em> is the first time I’ve seen pushback from within the franchise itself. The show is basically saying, “Sure, Star Trek can be exciting, but there’s a reason it became popular in the first place!” Let’s hope that with future programs like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-strange-new-worlds-announcement-161152028.html"><em>Strange New Worlds</em></a>, Alex Kurtzman is listening.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-episode-two-kayshon-his-eyes-open-070038927.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f8465fe0-8c5d-4699-a3e4-02f5b297b942</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 07:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628542488</ingested><modified>2021-08-09T20:54:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a055ce0-f949-11eb-a4ef-a397a5ba8ad7" width="3000" height="1687" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/1a055ce0-f949-11eb-a4ef-a397a5ba8ad7" width="3000" height="1687" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CBS]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA["Strange Energies" -- Jack Quaid as Ensign Brad Boimler,  Vanessa Marshall as First Officer, Jonathan Scott Frakes as Capt.

The most interesting bit is perhaps the 5-axis optical image stabilization, which uses both lens shifting and sensor shifting for maximum effect — apparently three times the angle than that of conventional optical stabilization, according to Oppo. If true, this would compensate for greater shakiness, thus allowing for faster capture and better low-light performance, even when handheld.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f85e3500-002b-11ec-bbe7-43e913aa0481" alt="OPPO comparison of 5-axis stabilization on professional camera with traditional OIS on smartphone." data-uuid="e8ab6a37-882a-3f86-bf5a-9c833a4c0056"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Oppo</div></figure><p>This kind of implementation is nothing new in the professional camera world, but the challenge here is to miniaturize the solution and fit everything into the little remaining space on a phone.

This will arrive in an unspecified Oppo phone sometime in Q4 of this year. The company is also working on an 85-200mm continuous optical zoom module to offer greater flexibility.

To take advantage, you’ll need a pair of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-06-apple-airpods-pro-review.html">AirPods Pro</a> or <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">AirPods Max</a>, as well as an iPhone or iPad with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-review-130053409.html">iOS 14</a> installed on the device. The toggle to enable the feature is located in the Control Center. As this is a slow rollout, you may not see the toggle even if you have the latest version of Netflix installed on your iPhone or iPad.</p><p>Spatial audio uses head-tracking to widen the soundstage of a movie or TV show and make it feel like the entire room you’re in is being filled with sound. The result is a more immersive experience. Netflix is a bit late to support spatial audio. Some of the more popular apps where you could use the feature before today include Disney+, HBO Max and Peacock. Still, there are just as many platforms where it’s not available. More notable examples include YouTube and Amazon Prime Video, making this a significant milestone for the feature all the same.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/netflix-spatial-audio-ios-14-230008619.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">37f8a657-780e-4a62-9ec2-cb5a60d06945</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 23:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629323898</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T21:58:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9810b5f0-006d-11ec-bfdf-d574d7747aa2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9810b5f0-006d-11ec-bfdf-d574d7747aa2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AirPods Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AirPods Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Twitter updates developer API to make Spaces easier to find]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twitter is working to make Spaces more discoverable.

PILLSID involves two separate parts. One component is an internal insulin dispenser that a doctor would surgically implant in your abdomen. The other is a magnetic capsule loaded with the hormone.</p><p>Anytime you need to refill the dispenser, you take one of the pills, and it travels down your digestive system until it reaches the point where the device is implanted near your small intestine. Using the power of magnets, the device rotates the capsule into position and then punctures it with a retractable needle and pumps the refill of insulin into a reservoir. The cool thing here is that the dispenser charges wirelessly, limiting the number of interventions a doctor needs to maintain the device. Once the capsule is empty, it continues its trip down your digestive system until you eventually poop it out. Good times.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the surface, the system may sound scary, but in a lot of ways, it’s preferable to many of the current tools you can use as a type 1 diabetes patient to regulate your blood sugar levels. Insulin pumps, for instance, involve a tube or needle that you need to self-administer. One jab might not be so bad, but some people need to get multiple injections per day. &quot;Maybe it&#39;s scary to think about a docking station inside the body, but it worked,&quot; Arianna Menciassi, one of the co-authors of the study, told <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/robot-operates-docking-station-inside-the-gut"><em><ins>IEEE Spectrum</ins></em></a>. Unintuitively, this is a much less intrusive system, and it has the potential to be useful for administering other life-saving drugs.</p><p>In a test involving three diabetic pigs, the research team found the system could successfully manage their insulin levels for several hours. In some instances, they found bodily fluids from the pigs would leak into the robot. So as a next step, the team is working on sealing the device better.</p><p>While it will likely be some time before PILLSID makes its way to hospitals, devices that attend to your medical needs from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-09-edible-robot-surgeons-cure-from-inside-out.html"><ins>inside your body</ins></a> are likely to become more and more common.

A New York-led coalition of 31 states and territories is <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-co-leads-bipartisan-coalition-calling-fda-regulate-e">pressuring</a> the Food and Drug Administration to regulate flavored e-cigarettes.

Since then, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-thom-browne-edition-teaser-173338204.html">every foldable Samsung has launched</a> has come in a special Thom Browne (TB) version. Just 3,500 units of these limited edition bundles are available each time, and according to Browne, “they <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-z-flip/thom-browne-edition/">sell out</a> supposedly in minutes.”</p><p>This year, Samsung is offering the Thom Browne bundles of the Fold 3 and Flip 3 <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-flip3-5g/thom-browne-edition/buy/galaxy-z-flip3-thom-browne-edition-sm-f711uzuyxaa/">for $3,449 and $2,349 respectively</a>. Each box comes with TB-themed versions of the foldable, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">Buds 2</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/galaxy-watch-4-hands-on-price-specs-availability-wear-os-tizen-body-composition-fat-scan-140031859.html">Galaxy Watch 4</a>, <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/web/express/cart/#/cart-info/?addItem%5B%5D=EP-P6300TWEGUS%2C1">wireless charger trio</a> and a selection of cases and straps. The regular Fold 3, Buds 2, Watch 4 and wireless charger cost $1,799, $150, $250 and $80 respectively, bringing the total to about $2,280, not including the cases and straps. So you’re paying about $1,000 more for the Thom Browne aesthetic.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The packaging for the special edition Fold 3 bundle is extravagant. Each device has its own labelled container and sits in slots carved out inside a giant box. Thankfully, most of the packaging is paper, so I didn’t feel too guilty about the environmental impact. A drawer beneath the devices holds all the accessories, like a pair of TB-themed straps for the watch, a case for the Fold 3 and covers for the Buds 2’s charging case. There’s also a special S Pen Pro in the Fold bundle that’s white with blue and red stripes on the inside.</p><div id="7f4db45d5f174cda85b5ee13f7c11c93"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yf8i1V5hEA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>All the devices have Thom Browne branding on them, and this year’s set features the designer’s signature stripes in red, white and blue. It’s a deliberate selection of colors meant to be an homage to American sportswear, but also acknowledge that it’s an Olympic year.</p><p>“The reference to the red, white and blue, and specifically the white with the red trim felt very reminiscent of old Olympics and old Olympics uniforms,” Browne told Engadget. “I love sports, I love athletes, I’ve been so inspired by athletes at that level,” he said. (He’s a swimmer, in case you were wondering. And while we’re in a parenthetical, I’m a thrower.)</p><p>But the stripe-centric design and familiar color scheme have always been a part of the Samsung bundles, which Browne said is “something that feels very signature to me.” He’s made sure to keep recognizable elements from his brand on them, because he felt people “would have been disappointed if it were to be approached any differently.”</p><p>Not only does the motif appear on the Galaxy devices’ externally, the Fold 3 and Watch 4 also have custom wallpapers in TB themes. The default background on the special edition Fold is covered in the designer’s signature gray-and-white vertical lines with a small postage stamp-esque square in the middle as the clock widget. At the top center of the screen is a small band of the red-white-and-blue pattern that’s reminiscent of a fabric bookmark. System icons and fonts match the overall theme as well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/82f26e40-005c-11ec-b9fe-325f7b8e0f6b" alt="Galaxy Z Fold 3 Thom Browne edition" data-uuid="ea69a566-7e50-31ea-8456-2c29e4053510"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Though there aren’t any differences in size between the TB edition devices and their standard counterparts, the shiny metal finish on the branded Fold and Watch make them feel sleeker somehow. I also vastly prefer the Thom Browne watch straps to Samsung’s boring, chunky versions. And though there isn’t much room on the buds for the company to add design flourishes, I love that it still managed to paint little strips of red-white-and-blue on each headphone. Though in that shape, they look like color-reversed French flags.</p><p>Now that the Thom Browne versions of these devices are in their third iteration, the designer is pretty familiar with the process of coming up with them. Each edition has taken about a year to create, and Browne said that the “most important thing for these collaborations is that you see the best from both parties.”</p><p>For Browne, the partnership has been a “really good, very supportive, mutually respectful relationship” that’s lasted over 15 years. Though the special edition foldables have only been around for about two years, Samsung has carried his collections in its stores in the past. But the opportunity to create a Thom Browne version of the original Z Flip was intriguing. Browne said the first phone he ever had was a flip phone, so “it was interesting to me, the idea of that iconic phone being reintroduced, yet, making it a very relevant device for today.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2512cb70-005d-11ec-bbf9-1d34a7f4acd2" style="height:475;width:633;" alt="Samsung Thom Browne edition bundle box" data-uuid="68baa02e-12ea-3b7c-a286-a2548619520b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Samsung</div></figure><p>Though Browne says Samsung has never put any limits on how he wanted to approach his designs for the devices, something he would make if anything was possible would be a phone made from pure gold. “That would be a challenge that I would like to give to Samsung.”</p><p>Perhaps because of how content he is with the partnership, Browne said he wouldn’t want to work with any other company in this field. He’s not thinking of making a Thom Browne smartwatch, though he’s open to considering other Samsung products.</p><p>Ultimately, the biggest benefit for him is probably visibility. “I hope, in a way, that the phone introduces a lot of new people to the world of Thom Browne.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-fold-flip-thom-browne-interview-pictures-200014649.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">62eb3061-7476-46f0-9763-813c66b268dd</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 20:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629316523</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T19:55:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c1068790-005a-11ec-b4e2-d20edb2d191b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c1068790-005a-11ec-b4e2-d20edb2d191b" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Galaxy Z Fold 3, S Pen Pro, Galaxy Watch 4 and Buds 2 in Thom Browne editions laid out on a wooden surface.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Thom Browne Galaxy bundle]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Senators urge FTC to investigate Tesla's Autopilot and self-driving claims]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/tesla"><ins>Tesla</ins></a> could face further federal scrutiny over its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/autopilot"><ins>Autopilot</ins></a> feature.

The agency is looking into a string of collisions between Tesla vehicles and parked emergency vehicles, one of which resulted in someone&#39;s death. The NHTSA said the Tesla vehicles in question all had Autopilot or Traffic Aware Cruise Control switched on when the crashes occurred.</p><p>Despite the name, FSD (for which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-raises-full-self-driving-price-132658526.html"><ins>Tesla charges $10,000</ins></a> when a car is purchased) doesn&#39;t yet make vehicles fully autonomous. FSD, which is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-expansion-8-3-171559184.html"><ins>in beta</ins></a>, is currently an advanced driver assistance feature that handles maneuvers such as automatic parking, lane changing and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-01-people-struggling-tesla-smart-summon-feature-safely.html"><ins>summoning the vehicle</ins></a> to a nearby location. It&#39;s a Level 2 autonomous driving system, whereas full self-driving capability with no human supervision required is Level 5. Tesla <a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/autopilot"><ins>notes</ins></a> on its website that &quot;Autopilot does not turn a Tesla into a self-driving car nor does it make a car autonomous.&quot;</p><p>Musk has made many claims over the years about Tesla being close to offering fully autonomous capabilities. In a January earnings call, Musk said he was &quot;highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year.&quot; However, a Tesla engineer later suggested the company was a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-dmv-memo-full-self-driving-171620124.html">long way off</a> from rolling out Level 5 functionality.</p><p>The National Transportation Safety Board previously accused Tesla of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ntsb-nhtsa-letter-tesla-210752970.html"><ins>overselling Autopilot&#39;s capabilities</ins></a>. In May, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/california-dmv-has-tesla-under-review-over-musks-fsd-claims-220447099.html"><ins>reports suggested</ins></a> the California Department of Motor Vehicles was looking into Musk&#39;s FSD claims.
