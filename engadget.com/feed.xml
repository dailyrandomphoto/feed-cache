For $49.99, they come with slip-resistant soles and plush inner lining that the company says will keep your feet “snug and warm during long gaming sessions. They’re also made from recycled materials. Before you dismiss the slippers as just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-manufacture-project-hazel-rgb-mask-120020874.html">another oddball product</a> from Razer, we’ll point out that there’s a cool story behind them.</p><div id="c5ac5292abdb46e4a338c77947d6f139"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H2T-fX227f4?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The slippers are part of Razer’s growing <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Sneki Snek lineup" href="https://fave.co/3z7i8Nu">Sneki Snek lineup</a>. It all started with a doodle one of the company’s designers drew for their newborn child. As these things usually go, Razer fans took to the mascot and started using it in memes. Some even got tattoos of Sneki Snek. It all eventually led to where we are today, with Razer releasing one Sneki Snek product after another.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Early in the process, the company decided to work with <a href="https://www.conservation.org/act/protect-an-acre">Conservation International</a> to donate part of the proceeds from each Sneki Snek sale towards saving forests. The company claims each purchase will help save 10 trees in countries like Costa Rica, Madagascar and China. Razer hopes to help save 1 million trees eventually. With each 100,000 milestone, the company has released a new Sneki Snek product. Previous releases include an adorable <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:plushie" href="https://fave.co/3ihhSVp">plushie</a> “optimized for cuddles” and a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:head pillow" href="https://fave.co/3klLdk6">head pillow</a> that “fits most gaming chairs.”</p><p>You can buy the Sneki Snek Slippers on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Razer&#x002019;s website" href="https://fave.co/3zjRilt">Razer’s website</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/razer-sneki-snek-slippers-162234774.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3ed5933c-689f-4019-981e-7b9ed6c63874</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 16:22:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626452892</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T16:28:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/88a4dc90-e650-11eb-bed4-c7cbdc986487" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/88a4dc90-e650-11eb-bed4-c7cbdc986487" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Razer]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Sneki Snek slippers]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Sneki Snek slippers]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[This week's best deals: $40 off Amazon's Fire 7 Kids Pro tablet and more]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon kicked off this week with a sale on its kids-focused tablets, speakers and other devices.

Canalys <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021?ctid=2143-0b9f92413ead631983febced55e12cd8">estimates</a> that the Chinese tech giant became the world&#39;s second-largest phone brand in the second quarter of 2021, surging 83 percent year-over-yer to claim 17 percent of the market. The company not only overtook Apple (14 percent) to claim the second spot, but blew past its BBK-owned Chinese rivals Oppo and Vivo, both of which held 10 percent. Samsung held on to its lead at 19 percent, but there&#39;s clearly not much of a gap.</p><p>The key, as you might guess, was price. Xiaomi&#39;s average selling prices are well below those of Samsung (40 percent) and Apple (75 percent), and even flagships like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-11-snapdragon-888-221003638.html">the Mi 11</a> are relatively affordable. That may have helped Xiaomi&#39;s strong international expansion, including a 300 percent jump in Latin America, a 150 percent spike in Africa and a 50 percent gain in Western Europe. And unlike its fallen competitor, Huawei, Xiaomi <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-removes-xiaomi-chinese-blocklist-094055806.html">doesn&#39;t have a US blacklisting</a> to cloud its future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not certain that Xiaomi will hold on to its position. The second quarter is historically weak for Apple as it reaches the tail end of a given iPhone&#39;s release cycle. Canalys also notes that Oppo and Vivo aren&#39;t staying still — they have their own dreams of world dominance. And if Xiaomi hopes to escape its low-cost reputation, it needs phones like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-price-launch-date-134516642.html">Mi 11 Ultra</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-price-launch-date-134516642.html">Mi Mix Fold</a> to resonate with the public.</p><p>Even a temporary second-place position would be notable, though. While Xiaomi has long had a major presence in its native China, the company has had a much tougher fight for international recognition. Now, it&#39;s large enough to battle with behemoths like Samsung and Apple — it&#39;s just a question of whether or not Xiaomi can become the frontrunner.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-second-largest-phone-brand-q2-2021-141814474.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c0a7c6c4-b0a4-4e8b-ba3d-44f4c84d7764</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 14:18:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626445097</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T14:18:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d02ca310-e63a-11eb-9dff-33015cba2899" width="5000" height="3343" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d02ca310-e63a-11eb-9dff-33015cba2899" width="5000" height="3343" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HONG KONG, CHINA - 2021/03/31: Pedestrians walk past the Xiaomi Mi 11 5G smartphone advertisement at its flagship store in Hong Kong.

goldfish]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last April, Facebook’s AI research lab (FAIR) announced and released as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-chatbot-ai-open-source-blender-150001320.html">open source its BlenderBot social chat app</a>. While the neophyte AI immediately proved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-23-microsofts-tay-ai-chat-bot.html">far less prone to racist outbursts</a> than previous attempts, BlenderBot was not without its shortcomings. For one, the system had the recollection capacity of a goldfish — any subject or data point the AI wasn’t initially trained simply didn’t exist in its online reality, as evidenced by the OG BB’s continued insistence that Tom Brady still plays for the New England Patriots. For another, due to its limited knowledge of current events, the system had a strong tendency to hallucinate knowledge, like a digital Dunning-Kruger effect. But the advancements <a href="https://parl.ai/projects/blenderbot2/">BlenderBot 2.0 displays</a>, which FAIR debuted on Friday, should make the AI far more sociable, knowledgeable, and capable.</p><p>While BlenderBot 1.0 could only maintain its memory for a single discussion, its successor can remember topics of conversation over the course of multiple talks that can take days, weeks or even months to complete thanks to the implementation of a long-term memory module. What’s more, the AI can actively update its knowledge base by searching the internet for the latest news and details on any subject that the user wishes to speak about.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“BlenderBot 2 queries the Bing API for search results based on a generated search query, and conditions its response on the top few results,” Kurt Shuster, Research Engineer at Facebook AI, told Engadget. “We rely on Bing to provide high quality search results.” As such, BlenderBot 2.0 is now capable of speaking coherently about breaking news and new media, not just the data it was trained upon.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ff16df40-e59c-11eb-8fbf-5a67dea986ff" alt="how blenderbot 2.0 works" data-uuid="e93943f0-a6fb-3611-8d83-f2c932c78604"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAIR</div></figure><p>“BlenderBot 2 is limited only by what a powerful search engine can provide,” Jason Weston, Research Scientist at Facebook AI, added. So for example, if you are more interested in learning about Tom Yewcic (the Patriot’s combo QB/Punter from the 1962 season) than you are about Tom Brady, BB 2.0 has you covered. It’s the same with more scholarly subjects, like photosynthesis or redox reactions, Weston continued. So long as the information is available on the web, “there is no reason BlenderBot 2 cannot discuss this.”</p><p>By actively searching the internet for information, BlenderBot 2.0 can also reduce the instances in which it hallucinates knowledge. “Providing the system with more commonsense reasoning will allow BlenderBot to make sure it does not confuse subtle concepts,” Weston explained, “such as a movie director versus a producer or a pitching coach versus a hitting coach.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e7dad7f0-e59c-11eb-bdff-3b3ec451d622" alt="the crown" data-uuid="c80ba4f5-4141-3abb-b112-a3df4148d87c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAIR</div></figure><p>The only wrinkle really occurs when discussing non-english based media, such as <a href="https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_Wiki"><em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em></a>. “It is reasonable to conclude Bing will surface information about it and BlenderBot 2 can use that information accordingly,” he said. “We currently focus on english-based search results, so non-english references may not be fully covered.” The system will, however, recognize that <em>Demon Slayer</em> is of interest to you and will be more likely to bring up manga-centric subjects in future discussions.</p><p>FAIR has taken multiple steps to ensure that BlenderBot does not become the next Tay. “BlenderBot 2 does not learn directly from user input, as Tay did,” Shuster said. “We have taken extensive safety steps to ensure that BlenderBot 2 can handle adversarial users. Specifically, we employ both baked-in and two-stage techniques. BlenderBot 2 can detect itself if the incoming context will result in an offensive response, and additional safety layers where a safety classifier can detect if either the user input or the bot&#39;s output is offensive. Each handles the response appropriately.”</p><p>And while the system is currently focused on chewing its way through the English language corpus, FAIR does see BlenderBot does eventually extend to other languages as well. “While not in our immediate plans, the goal of our team is to build a superhuman conversationalist,” Shuster said. “This kind of agent requires multilingual understanding.”</p><p>Recent internal benchmarking processes found that BlenderBot 2.0 outperformed its predecessor by 17 percent in its engagingness score and 55 percent in its use of previous conversation sessions according to human evaluators, per a Friday blog from FAIR. What’s more, BlenderBot&#39;s rate of knowledge hallucinations dropped from 9 percent (!) in BB 1.0 down to just 3 percent in the current iteration.</p><p>Looking ahead, “humans interacting with AI systems via discourse is the future of AI,” Weston asserted, “and ensuring that humans have an engaging, informative experience is critical to that future. BlenderBot 2 combines the engagingness of BlenderBot 1.0 with the knowledge capabilities of a system with access to the entire internet, so ostensibly we are on the right track.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebooks-open-source-chatbot-no-longer-has-the-mental-fortitude-of-a-goldfish-133039125.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ab7bbf8-97d3-4246-94d7-a37b5eca5009</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 13:30:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626379744</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T20:09:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9cfb8e90-e59d-11eb-abef-299d17b46332" width="5390" height="3498" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9cfb8e90-e59d-11eb-abef-299d17b46332" width="5390" height="3498" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Aubrey via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Goldfish in Fish Bowl]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Valve made a $399 handheld gaming PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve just surprised us all with a handheld console.

There is no shortage of control options either, with dual thumbsticks, two pretty large square trackpads, an old-school directional pad, four main face buttons, triggers and a quartet of grip buttons.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3679c50-e596-11eb-beb1-13c0fd5f32a1" style="height:859;width:1657;" alt="Valve Steam Deck" data-uuid="b29fa5ba-abaf-30c9-83bb-bc70ff0d8bb1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure></a><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it’s just shy of a foot long. Eesh. Valve has ensured there’s enough power inside to tempt PC gamers that already have an expansive Steam library. There’s an AMD 2.4-3.5GHz processor and a 1.0 to 1.6GHz GPU with eight RDNA 2 compute units.  There’s 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM inside, too. Valve promises a battery life of between two and eight hours on a single charge, depending on how much power you need for your games. Given the power many AAA PC games require, you can probably expect a lot of experiences to hover around the lower estimates.</p><p>While the Steam Deck might not be as powerful as your gaming PC, Valve is using Proton, a compatibility layer that lets games run without developers having to do any work porting titles across — you&#39;ll apparently have access to your full library of games. This price point makes it slightly more expensive than the Switch, and the same price as the digital-only PS5. Due to its Steam hooks, however, it’s a very different proposition. How well will PC games play on a seven-inch handheld?</p><p></p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-facecam-streaming-gaming-webcam-193052663.html">Elgato&#39;s first webcam has landed</a></h2><h3>It’s good hardware for streamers.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-facecam-streaming-gaming-webcam-193052663.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0e44b360-e41d-11eb-9ffb-6999313f1231" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Elgato FaceCam mounted on a monitor" data-uuid="69fa0608-41b8-3e32-8de2-2b018b10f74d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure></a><p>Elgato’s first $200 web camera isn’t all that unique.

Turns out, people liked the idea of ordering a weather report from a superstar, because Amazon is <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/alexa-introduce-me-to-melissa-and-shaq">adding</a> two more famous voices to Alexa&#39;s toolkit.

The new voice options don&#39;t come with an early discount, so you&#39;ll have to fork out $5 for each. But, the prospect of hearing Shaq rap and McCarthy tell jokes may seal the deal for some.

As part of that plan, the Department of Energy (DoE) has <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-department-energy-kicks-summer-solar-2021-tool-fast-tracks-solar-power-communities">announced</a> that it&#39;s rolling out a new tool that will make it much easier and faster to get a permit for a rooftop solar installation.&nbsp;</p><p>The cost of solar has plunged 90 percent over past decade, but permit-related costs can take up to a third of the price of a rooftop installation. On top of that, with solar permitting varying widely around the US, some customers must wait months to get approval, the DoE wrote.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Solar Automated Permit Processing (SolarAPP+) platform will supposedly solve those issues, becoming the standard portal for local governments to process permit applications.

The list includes charming candidates like a melting smiley face, a disco ball, beans and a pointing finger in various skin tones. Not every emoji you see below will make the cut.

The new experiment comes in response to the Oversight Board, which has said the social network should be more transparent with users about how their posts are removed.</p><p>The company revealed the new test in a <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/facebooks-first-quarterly-update-on-the-oversight-board/">new report</a> that provides updates on how Facebook is handling the Oversight Board’s policy recommendations. The test comes in response to one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-initial-judgments-141352775.html">first cases</a> the Oversight Board took up, which dealt with an Instagram post meant to raise awareness of breast cancer that the company removed under its nudity rules.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook restored the post, saying its automated systems had made a mistake, and updated Instagram’s rules to allow for “health-related nudity.” But the Oversight Board had also recommended that Facebook alert users in cases when a post was removed with automation rather than as a result of a human content reviewer. Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-responds-oversight-board-recommendations-210841361.html">previously said</a> it would test this change, which is now in effect.</p><p>“We’ve launched a test on Facebook to assess the impact of telling people more about whether automation was involved in enforcement,” facebook writes in its report. “People in the test now see whether technology or a Facebook content reviewer made the enforcement decision about their content. We will analyze the results to see if people had a clearer understanding of who removed their content, while also watching for a potential rise in recidivism and appeals rates.” The company added that it will provide an update on the test later this year.</p><p>The report also shed some additional insight into how the company is working with the Oversight Board. The report notes that between November 2020 and March 2021 it referred 26 cases to the board, though it’s only chosen to take up three — one of which was in response to its suspension of Donald Trump. (Notably, the latest report only covers the first quarter of 2021, so it doesn’t address the board’s recommendations in response to Trump’s suspension.)</p><p>Though the Oversight Board has only weighed in on a handful of cases, its decisions have resulted in a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-satire-exception-community-standards-oversight-board-212257406.html">policy</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-hate-speech-194501894.html">changes</a> by Facebook that could have a much broader effect. However, in some areas, the company has declined to follow up on its policy suggestions, such as one that Facebook study i<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html">ts own role</a> in enabling the events of January 6th. In a blog post, the company noted that “the size and scope of the board’s recommendations go beyond the policy guidance that we first anticipated when we set up the board, and several require multi-month or multi-year investments.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-notifying-some-users-whose-posts-were-removed-by-automation-212939760.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eef6f31a-662c-4e5a-bcc5-a2ce3f02cdf0</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 21:29:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626383698</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T21:15:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/f080ea20-147d-11eb-9f7f-8bd7d7c101e5" width="4396" height="2747" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/f080ea20-147d-11eb-9f7f-8bd7d7c101e5" width="4396" height="2747" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 07: Facebook logo is seen on a smartphone as Oversight Board at the background in Ankara, Turkey on May 07, 2020.

In a separate <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/anthony-bourdain-morgan-neville-roadrunner-documentary">interview with <em>GQ</em></a>, Neville said he contacted four different companies about the project before deciding on the best one. That company fed about a dozen hours of audio to an AI model.

The film, as far as we’re aware, doesn’t include a disclosure that AI was used to replicate Bourdain’s voice. “If you watch the film, other than that line you mentioned, you probably don’t know what the other lines are that were spoken by the AI, and you’re not going to know,” Neville told <em>The New Yorker</em>. “We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later.” In his interview with <em>GQ</em>, he said Bourdain’s family told him “Tony would have been cool with that,” adding, “I was just trying to make [the quotes] come alive.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anthony-bourdain-roadrunner-ai-voice-210643678.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4545b5b5-a9fa-4c66-a419-6337001cd889</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 21:06:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626447712</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T15:02:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/aff9d1e0-e5ad-11eb-bfdb-c92208e286e1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/aff9d1e0-e5ad-11eb-bfdb-c92208e286e1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CNN / Focus Features]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anthony Bourdain]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anthony Bourdain]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Candace Parker is NBA 2K's first female cover athlete]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twenty two years after the debut of <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/nba%202k"><ins>NBA 2K</ins></a>, the basketball sim series will feature a woman on the cover of the game <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/nbar-2k22-features-candace-parker-as-first-wnba-cover-athlete-in-exclusive-edition"><ins>for the first time</ins></a>.

The past half decade has seen the introduction of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-03-23-elgatos-control-pad-is-a-livestreaming-sidekick.html">Stream Deck</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-24-elgato-introduces-a-100-mini-version-of-its-livestream-controll.html">line</a> for easily initiating macros during a broadcast; different kinds of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-ring-light-130016714.html">lighting</a>; and, last year, the company’s first <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-wave-1-wave-3-usb-mic-180533989.html">gaming microphones</a>. The one thing missing in this list was a webcam — until today’s introduction of the Elgato FaceCam.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9152fdf0-e41a-11eb-9fef-b769a7c3e924" alt="Elgato FaceCam mounted on a monitor" data-uuid="15c721a4-696b-3560-8dc4-022955d0bc50"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>On its surface, the $200 camera is not that unique. It’s a chunky rectangular box that can be easily clipped on top of a monitor, or connected to Elgato’s multi mount system. It shoots 1080p at 60fps, with a Sony-made STARVIS CMOS sensor. It may not be 4K, but most streamers don’t need that kind of resolution right now. The FaceCam makes up for it with a robust suite of settings in its dedicated Camera Hub program. Yes, you’ll have to download another piece of software for this camera to run alongside Game Capture, Stream Deck, Wave Link (for the mics) and Control Center (for the lighting), which is a little annoying. Other companies bundle all their different drivers and settings into one tool, but I suppose keeping them separate probably makes sending out updates easier.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d4891b90-e41a-11eb-be87-513e555c8a2c" alt="It&#39;s a me on the screen" data-uuid="07af371b-5453-34d4-b3a7-0cdfc5f55f35"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>In the Camera Hub you’ll have easy access to things like contrast, exposure and white balance. (The latter two can be set to automatic so you have one less thing to fuss over.) The automatic white balance was a little warm for my taste, but it was easy enough to turn it off and knock the number down to a cooler 4000K. The software also comes with zoom options, but it’s nothing to write home about, as the camera is fixed focus. You’ll always be sharp as long as you always remain between 12 inches (30 cm) and 47 inches (120 cm) from the camera. That should take care of anyone working at a desk; anyone who moves further back would be better served with something a little more portable with advanced settings.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8b53ffc0-e41b-11eb-bf7f-1f13788d7e5a" alt="Elgato Camera Hub, close up to my chin" data-uuid="ed278b57-c136-3246-84da-d22b9a270e2e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>The biggest draw of the Camera Hub is the real-time ISO reading, which makes it a lot easier to detect and react to changes in your lighting. Maybe your lights are too bright, or maybe the natural light from outside vanished with an oncoming thunderstorm (which is exactly what’s happening as I type this). The exposure and white balance can adjust automatically, or you can tweak the settings yourself on the fly. There’s a Stream Deck plugin available, which should make it possible to adjust the settings with the touch of a button. Of course, that’s dependent on you having smart lighting in the first place, like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Elgato&#x002019;s Key Light" href="https://amzn.to/3wJcijR">Elgato’s Key Light</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Ring Light" href="https://amzn.to/3zgzFD5">Ring Light</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/29971830-e41b-11eb-9bfd-df9544fbfa61" alt="Exposure, ISO 426" data-uuid="99257739-9e87-3e8d-86e4-a15a2486746b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s a definite sense that you’re meant to go all-in on Elgato’s streaming lineup, probably best evidenced by the lack of a microphone in the FaceCam. The company says it didn’t bother since most gamers tend to use headsets anyway, but let’s face it: Elgato would rather you pick up one of its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wave:1" href="https://amzn.to/3e2F48h">Wave:1</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wave:3" href="https://amzn.to/2TY1DnP">Wave:3</a> mics. They do indeed sound great, but they’re not my preferred microphones thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-wave-3-microphone-hands-on-150021908.html">some issues I had</a> with getting the Wave:3 to work while I was wearing a headset — yes, even one made by Elgato’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-corsair-acquires-elgato-gaming.html">parent company</a> Corsair.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/27fb4d10-e41c-11eb-977f-553e0db2d59c" alt="Elgato Camera Hub, hey look it&#39;s me" data-uuid="31f9cc9f-c1fe-3c22-8108-cef3ca0be96d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>For the most part, the FaceCam has a lot fewer kinks. My biggest problem was plugging it in, as it must be plugged into your system directly and not via a hub. And that’s tough with many modern laptops, which may only have two USB-C ports. The FaceCam comes with a USB-C to USB-A cord, and the company recommends you use the included wire instead of providing your own. I was forced to search around for a converter dongle. While I commend companies for finally embracing USB-C in their gaming accessories, we need some solutions on the software side to ensure that they can actually be used with hubs. My Logitech C920 works with a hub and it comes with a built-in mic, so it’s likely to remain my default webcam for most purposes.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/00665b10-e41b-11eb-82b7-111b8417758f" alt="Elgato FaceCam mounted on top of a monitor" data-uuid="f1265b1e-9f7f-34d9-8335-0edd662d58e9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Still, the FaceCam is off to a promising start. The video quality is crisp and free of noise, and when it’s not there’s a built-in filter you can enable. I haven’t needed it to, though, as the camera has handled my Google Hangouts and Zoom calls with ease. The price is a bit steep, but still on par with Logitech’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Brio 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3hum19f">Brio 4K</a> and Razer’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kiyo Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3hSHB6i">Kiyo Pro</a>, both of which cost $200.

In a press release, the Surgeon General said that “health misinformation has already caused significant harm” and undermined vaccination efforts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The advisory includes a <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-misinformation-advisory.pdf">22-page report</a> on steps that individuals, health organizations, researchers and journalists can take to help mitigate the spread of misinformation. Notably, it also calls out social media companies, though it stops short of calling any of the platforms out by name. But the report echoes much of the criticism that platforms like Facebook and Twitter have faced during the pandemic.</p><p>“Product features built into technology platforms have contributed to the spread of misinformation, the report states. “For example, social media platforms incentivize people to share content to get likes, comments, and other positive signals of engagement. These features help connect and inform people but reward engagement rather than accuracy, allowing emotionally charged misinformation to spread more easily than emotionally neutral content.”</p><p>The report also highlights the problem of algorithmic amplification, which can make it difficult for companies like Facebook to prevent misinformation from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/viral-plandemic-conspiracy-theory-230626744.html">going viral</a>.</p><p>“Algorithms that determine what users see online often prioritize content based on its popularity or similarity to previously seen content,” the report says. “As a result, a user exposed to misinformation once could see more and more of it over time, further reinforcing one’s misunderstanding. Some websites also combine different kinds of information, such as news, ads, and posts from users, into a single feed, which can leave consumers confused about the underlying source of any given piece of content.”</p><p>The report also recommends that companies “prioritize early detection of misinformation ‘super-spreaders’ and repeat offenders.” A widely cited report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate found more than half of anti-vaccine misinformation online can be linked to just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anti-vaccine-misinformation-report-12-accounts-212245856.html">12 individuals</a>. On Thursday, White House Press Secretary <a href="https://twitter.com/Acyn/status/1415725645875740672">Jen Psaki</a> also referenced that same report, noting that many of these “super-spreaders” remain active on Facebook.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/us-surgeon-general-health-misinformation-advisory-191241209.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">160d42a2-ecc4-4e8e-aca3-9211d3d9a7c4</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 19:12:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626424338</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T08:32:31+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/069e7c70-e5a0-11eb-a7b7-3ab26e0c4301" width="3701" height="2354" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/069e7c70-e5a0-11eb-a7b7-3ab26e0c4301" width="3701" height="2354" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SAUL LOEB via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[US Surgeon General Dr. Vivek H.

At the center of the campaign was a group known as Tortiseshell. Facebook says the collective went after individuals and companies in the defense and aerospace industries. Its primary targets were in the US, but they also sought out people in the UK and parts of Europe.</p><p>“This activity had the hallmarks of a well-resourced and persistent operation, while relying on relatively strong operational security measures to hide who’s behind it,” Facebook said. &quot;Our platform was one of the elements of the much broader cross-platform cyber-espionage operation, and its activity on Facebook manifested primarily in social engineering and driving people off-platform (e.g., email, messaging and collaboration services and websites), rather than directly sharing of the malware itself.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What went down appears to be unprecedented for Tortoiseshell. In the past, the group has primarily targeted <a href="https://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/tortoiseshell-apt-supply-chain">IT companies throughout the Middle East</a>. The methods it employed were similar to those that China’s Evil Eye used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-evil-eye-uyghur-210523469.html">target the Uyghur community</a> earlier in the year.</p><p>Facebook says the group created “sophisticated online personas” to contact its targets and build trust with them before trying to convince them to click on malicious links. They had accounts across multiple social media platforms to make their ruse appear more credible. The group built fake recruiting websites and even went so far as to spoof a legitimate US Department of Labor job search tool.

The company has revealed the <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/">Steam Deck</a>, which will arrive in December in the US, Canada, the European Union and the UK, with availability expanding to more regions later. The system starts at $399.</p><p>Although the hardware isn’t final, according to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLtiRGTZvGM"><em>IGN</em></a>, the device currently looks like a mashup of a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/how-to-pre-order-nintendo-switch-oled-155417723.html">Switch</a>, a Sega Game Gear and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-27-valve-steam-controller-sale-discontinued.html">Steam Controller</a>. It has a seven-inch touchscreen, with a resolution of 1,280 x 800 at a 16:10 aspect ratio, 400 nits of brightness and a 60Hz refresh rate.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d7a71ac0-e596-11eb-87d4-c8ec38b02935" alt="Valve Steam Deck" data-uuid="d5b3420d-2c2c-3850-bd88-c7d7ed7e17a0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure><p>There are dual thumbsticks, two 32.5mm square trackpads, an analog directional pad, four main face buttons, triggers and a quartet of grip buttons, as well as gyro controls. The Steam Deck also has a headphone jack, stereo speakers, dual microphones and haptic feedback. It weighs around 669 grams and it&#39;s just under a foot wide.</p><p>Valve teamed up with AMD on the hardware. The Steam Deck&#39;s custom chipset features a 2.4-3.5GHz processor and a 1.0 to 1.6GHz GPU with eight RDNA 2 compute units. Valve claims it&#39;s a &quot;Zen 2 + RDNA 2 powerhouse&quot; that&#39;s capable of running the latest major games &quot;in a very efficient power envelope.&quot;</p><p>The handheld PC comes with 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM and up to 512GB of NVMe internal storage, which you can expand with a microSD card. Valve says the 40-watt-hour battery will power the device for between two and eight hours on a single charge. The battery life will depend on how resource intensive the games you play are. The Switch, meanwhile, runs for up to nine hours.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/da788a40-e596-11eb-8feb-978cb67dd0e5" alt="Valve Steam Deck" data-uuid="345bae6c-36c6-3317-8d1d-ea07c8d4486a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure><p>Steam Deck runs on a new version of SteamOS that&#39;s designed for handheld use. Valve says it uses Proton, a compatibility layer that lets games run without developers having do any porting work. You&#39;ll have access to your full library of games. You can expect to have access to many Steam features, including chat, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/steam-remote-play-together-account-invite-anyone-175017613.html">remote play</a> (so you can play games from your PC just about anywhere), cloud saves and, of course, the Steam storefront.</p><p>The device has a built-in quick suspend and resume feature. Pressing the power button will suspend your game and send the Steam Deck into sleep mode. You&#39;ll be able to continue where you left off when you hit the power button again.</p><p>Steam Deck will support a variety of Bluetooth and USB-C peripherals. You can plug in a powered USB-C hub and use multiple devices at once. You can connect the system to an external display and play games at up to 8K at 60Hz or 4K at 120Hz.</p><div id="0a77c1b8197447fdad07d327c028219b"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing Steam Deck: powerful, portable PC gaming starting at $399.

Even within the US federal bureaucracy, different agencies use different standards. What NASA mission control considers the edge of space is actually 26 miles farther out than where the NOAA and US Air Force demark the atmospheric boundary.

Well, we did find out who was pulling the strings behind the Time Variance Authority and why, but it really served as an introduction to a villain who’s scheduled to make his next appearance in <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>However, <em>Loki</em> never felt like an extended prequel to, well, anything. It’s been a show that’s stood largely on its own, one which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/loki-disney-plus-premiere-review-160028040.html">forged</a> a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-marvel-studios-loki-episode-two-180043690.html">unique identity</a> apart from everything else in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel%20cinematic%20universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>, including the Thor movies. After all, this isn’t the Loki we spent eight years watching on screen. This one was created in 2019 in the middle of <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, a variant that so far is walking a path free of Asgard and all that pesky Avengers business.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4cd225a0-e57f-11eb-b93f-dae57671e846" alt="Tom Hiddleston and Sophia Di Martino" data-uuid="3d46082e-1217-30fe-bd95-e8d433838974"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>And so <em>Loki</em> the show paved its own road as well, not really relying too much on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-star-wars-marvel-universe-canon-continuity-120159180.html">knowledge of the films</a> past the first and last Avengers movies. You could walk into the series knowing as much about Loki’s fate as the variant Loki and walk away after the first season knowing just as little. The finale was interesting because for the first time, I have no idea how a Marvel show fits into the greater scheme of things. And like He Who Remains, I find that a bit exciting.</p><p>One thing that has been true of all the Marvel shows has that we’ve always generally known where they’re supposed to slot into the bigger universe. <em>Agents of SHIELD</em> was originally intended to be a way for the side stories of the Marvel Cinematic Universe to thrive but for a while it was treated as a place to dump movie leftovers. <em>Daredevil</em>, <em>Luke Cage</em>, <em>Jessica Jones</em> and <em>Iron Fist </em>were originally aimed toward setting up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-03-marvel-the-defenders-netflix-full-trailer.html"><em>The Defenders</em></a> limited series. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/wandavision-disney-plus-binging-180519635.html"><em>WandaVision</em></a> was a prequel for <em>Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness</em>, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/falcon-and-winter-soldier-episode-six-captain-america-disney-plus-133033258.html"><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a> did character work for the next Captain America film.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eb411390-e57f-11eb-9bbb-8b779f94e35e" alt="Tara Strong as Miss Minutes and Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Renslayer" data-uuid="e13088d0-e2e0-31a0-bbf6-6589a71bb10f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>But <em>Loki</em>, aside from wrapping up a loose thread from <em>Endgame</em>, doesn’t actually tie into anything, especially any upcoming projects. They don’t even name the man behind the curtain, he’s just “He Who Remains.” And he’s killed by the end of the episode, which means any time we see him from this point forward, it’s technically a different person; another cosmic iteration of the same jerk. Fans of the comics know that he’s meant to be <a href="https://www.marvel.com/characters/kang">Kang the Conqueror</a>, but that big reveal is yet to come — because the man we met is not a conqueror. He was a cosmic bureaucrat.</p><p>The conqueror, though hinted at in the <em>Loki</em> finale, will make his first full appearance in early 2023. He won’t remember the events shown in the <a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/5bAzOD">Disney+</a> show since he wasn’t actually there, which means either the film will completely ignore all we learned here, or explain it to the audience anew. Prior knowledge of <em>Loki</em> shouldn’t and most likely won’t be necessary.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/4c361740-e580-11eb-9ffe-3f49ae979aab" alt="Sophia Di Martino and Tom Hiddleston" data-uuid="e6e3494a-b84c-381e-b748-b3256fd9d5a5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>Which leaves season two of <em>Loki</em> free to do almost anything it wants. The man who seems to now be in charge of the TVA is unlikely to be even close to the same man that Scott Lang and Hope Pym will have to tangle with, since we are dealing with a multiverse of possibilities. It does throw the next Doctor Strange movie into a bit of uncertainty, since in our original non-COVID timeline that was supposed to have premiered back in May. Were we supposed to see the debut of the multiverse before we saw its origin? Or will there be some other cosmic wrench to mess things up further for the MCU? A lot of things that seemed inevitable when all these projects were originally announced have now been thrown into uncertainty.</p><p>But for now, the key takeaway from the <em>Loki</em> finale is that the series is not beholden to anything else in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It didn’t have to load up a ton of character development or make sure everything is back in place plot wise before the next film. It’s free to take its small cast of characters and fully explore their possibilities, with no worries about how it will affect the other Marvel properties. What will happen to Loki, Sylvie, Mobius, Ravonna and the rest? We can focus on their individual stories instead of fussing over what can and can’t happen.</p><p>We can no longer make predictions based on future projects in the pipeline, or contractual obligations of actors. Theories can proliferate and almost nothing is off-limits. Every step Loki and the rest take just means another multiverse to explore in shows like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/what-if-disney-plus-august-11-183845530.html"><em>What If?</em></a>. The Sacred Timeline is dead, and so are the shackles of movie continuity.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/disney-plus-loki-finale-episode-six-163019038.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fafbe022-2725-48eb-93d6-55e95c1d85e2</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 16:30:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626384928</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T21:35:53+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f1a90cc0-e57e-11eb-9de1-1371558c12d9" width="3840" height="1608" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f1a90cc0-e57e-11eb-9de1-1371558c12d9" width="3840" height="1608" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Boastful Loki, Kid Loki, Alligator Loki and Classic Loki]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Council of Lokis]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
