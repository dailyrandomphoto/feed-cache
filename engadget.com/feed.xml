Leaker Alessandro Paluzzi has <a href="https://twitter.com/alex193a/status/1480645433739337754">discovered</a> that Instagram has been developing an &quot;edit grid&quot; feature that would let you reorder the posts in your profile. This could help musicians or stores using multi-post collages to plug their latest work, but it might also be helpful if you want to highlight an important post or prioritize your favorites.</p><p>We&#39;ve asked Instagram for comment. It&#39;s not clear if the social network plans to test or widely distribute the feature.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if the customizable profile grid became a mainstay, though. Instagram has spent more and more of its time <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-shop-ads-083632822.html">courting businesses and shops</a>, and the option to rearrange the grid might attract  companies wanting to fine-tune their public image.

The brand has <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nordictrack-from-ifit-unveils-voice-controlled-adjustable-dumbbells--the-first-to-offer-works-with-alexa-301457803.html?tc=eml_cleartime">introduced</a> iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells that can use an Alexa-capable third-party device to quickly adjust the weight from 5lbs to 50lbs (in 5lb increments) using a motorized selector.

There&#39;s even a tablet holder on the weight tray to let you use your own screen and service. This might make sense if space is at a premium, or if you&#39;d rather not hog the TV.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The NordicTrack dumbbells are available now through Amazon <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells" href="https://amzn.to/3qijzHn">for $429</a>. That&#39;s expensive compared to many conventional adjustable sets, but you might not mind if the speed of adjustments is more important than price. We&#39;d add that some adjustable sets don&#39;t offer this level of flexibility — the 5lb changes could help you ease into heavier weights over time.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nordictrack-iselect-adjustable-dumbbells-alexa-142942754.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ecfd3691-4b91-4c86-89ba-5e2ed5f401c6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:29:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641911384</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T14:29:52+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/58436570-72e2-11ec-b773-f87fa17e9b31" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/58436570-72e2-11ec-b773-f87fa17e9b31" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NordicTrack from iFit]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells with Alexa support]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NordicTrack iSelect Adjustable Dumbbells with Alexa support]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Nintendo Switch Online and microSD bundle is half off on Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hunkering down for the winter months can mean more time to play some new games while you stay inside. For Switch owners that want to play with friends remotely and get access to classic games, a Nintendo Switch Online membership is well worth the price. Now, Amazon has a deal on a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:bundle" href="https://amzn.to/3GgH6hl">bundle</a> that includes one year of the Switch Online family plan and a 128GB SanDisk microSD card for $35. Since both the membership and the card normally cost $35, you&#39;re essentially getting the extra storage for free.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3GgH6hl" id="5ec6345d4609451e93384b3044469560" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Switch Online Family Plan bundle at Amazon - $35</a><p>At its debut, the main selling point of the membership was online play, but Nintendo has added more perks to it over the years. It now includes online backups for gameplay data, access to the Switch Online mobile app that lets you voice chat with friends while you&#39;re playing together, and access to a library of more than 70 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-snes-switch-online-claymates-jelly-boy-bombuzal-150021227.html">NES and SNES</a> titles to play at any time. This particular bundle is best for those with large families, and possibly more than one Switch in the house, since up to eight users can take advantage of the membership&#39;s benefits.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the things we usually recommend <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-oled-accessories-150048703.html">new Switch owners</a> buy is a microSD card since it&#39;s easy to quickly fill up the console&#39;s built-in, 64GB of storage with games. The licensed 128GB SanDisk model included in this bundle is a solid one, with read speeds up to 100 MB/s and write speeds up to 90 MB/s. Even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll need the extra space, you probably will as you collect more titles, save files and screenshots over time.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-online-and-microsd-bundle-is-half-off-on-amazon-141140268.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">267a8846-43f4-444f-946f-5bd9752dc1c1</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 14:11:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641909782</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T14:03:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1261f690-72e5-11ec-ae4f-ba53ddf91562" width="1500" height="1124" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1261f690-72e5-11ec-ae4f-ba53ddf91562" width="1500" height="1124" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SanDisk]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SanDisk 128GB microSD card Nintendo Switch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[SanDisk 128GB microSD card Nintendo Switch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Firefox Focus for Android will offer another way to prevent cross-site tracking]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Android version of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mozilla-firefox-focus-mobile-updates-130514586.html">Firefox Focus browser</a> is getting another layer of privacy protection.

One of the latest organizations to jump into the craze is the Associated Press (AP), which will <a href="https://www.ap.org/press-releases/2022/ap-to-launch-nft-marketplace-built-by-xooa">start selling</a> its &quot;award-winning contemporary and historic photojournalism&quot; as non-fungible tokens on January 31st.

Each one will include the image&#39;s original metadata that shows the time and date it was taken, its location, and the equipment and settings the photographer used for the shot. They agency says the marketplace will allow people to buy, sell and trade the tokens, which can be purchased using credit cards and crypto wallets. The proceeds it will earn from the sales will then be used to fund its operations. One of the biggest controversies surrounding NFTs is that they have a huge <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/nfts-hot-effect-earth-climate/">environmental impact</a>. AP says its NFTs will be minted on the Polygon blockchain that was designed to consume less energy than its counterparts.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whether AP successfully sells its photos for the kind of money it&#39;s hoping to earn remains to be seen.

With rapid test kits in short supply, though, some retailers are making them unaffordable by gouging customers. Now, the Biden administration has announced that testing kits must be covered by private insurance, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/white-house-says-private-insurers-to-cover-rapid-covid-19-tests-starting-saturday-11641848589"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> has reported.&nbsp;</p><p>People covered by private health insurance can be reimbursed for up to eight tests a month per individual. To make things simpler, the White House is encouraging insurers to partner with retailers and pharmacies so people can pick up tests without paying up front or submitting a claim. The tests are available without deductibles, coinsurance or co-payment, so a family of four on the same health plan could be reimbursed for 32 tests a month, for instance. For such programs, reimbursement would be limited to $12 per test.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>Today’s action further removes financial barriers and expands access to Covid-19 tests for millions of people.</p></blockquote><p>The new policy doesn&#39;t apply to Medicare, which counts more than 60 million seniors at higher risk for COVID-19 complications. However, Medicaid for low income folks already covers at-home COVID-19 tests authorized by the FDA. The administration also plans to make tens of millions of free tests available to uninsured Americans at health clinics and other sites, according to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/us/politics/insurance-covid-tests.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Some insurers said that the administration is acting too late and that it didn&#39;t address the shortage of at-home tests. However, one national association of coverage providers said that the new plan &quot;takes steps to mitigate the real risks of price gouging, fraud and abuse.&quot;</p><p>Having enough diagnostic tests will be key to slowing down the Omicron wave that is starting to overwhelm health systems in the US and elsewhere. It can help get infected people isolated or into treatment more quickly, reducing potential transmission and hospital workloads.&nbsp;</p><p>That will become even more important given authorization for antiviral pills from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fda-pfizer-covid-antiviral-pill-paxlovid-205104688.html">Pfizer</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fda-merck-covid-19-antivirual-pill-molnupiravir-162951648.html">Merck</a> that can help high-risk patients with mild to moderate COVID symptoms — provided they&#39;re diagnosed in time. &quot;This policy will help millions of families afford COVID tests that allow them to be in school, visit family members and live their lives,&quot; Georgetown University&#39;s Sabrina Corlette told the <em>WSJ</em>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/covid-tests-will-soon-be-covered-100-percent-by-insurance-132011189.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d134014-caf5-440e-b057-86bd2a21deb8</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 13:20:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641906683</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T13:11:41+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ebcf4a30-6e81-11ec-beb7-475697e0b288" width="4896" height="3264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/ebcf4a30-6e81-11ec-beb7-475697e0b288" width="4896" height="3264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spencer Platt via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NEW YORK, NEW YORK - DECEMBER 22:  A take-home COVID-19 testing kit is displayed on the shelf of a Manhattan drugstore on December 22, 2021 in New York City.

Judging by the leaks and rumors, you can expect to see three different devices, too, with differing screen sizes, specs and prices. The top of the range Galaxy S22 Ultra may feature a Super Clear Lens on its camera array.

Honor’s Magic V is its first attempt at the foldable form factor, and like Samsung&#39;s Z Fold devices, it’s a dual-screen smartphone. On the outside, it has a 6.45-inch, 431 PPI external display with a resolution of 2,560 x 1,080, 120Hz refresh rate and 21:9 aspect ratio. Open it up, and you’ll unfold a 7.9-inch screen that has a 2,272 x 1,984 resolution and 90Hz refresh rate. In a bid to fight the issues of creases on these very expensive devices, Honor says its water-drop hinge helps avoid wrinkles.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-v-foldable-smartphone-153214121.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><p><strong>Sponsored by Verizon</strong></p><p><a href="https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N2998.4294324YAHOOADTECHLLC/B26980868.324488828;dc_trk_aid=517043007;dc_trk_cid=163975568;u=TV2_PAI~DC_IMI~_DSP~_BID~;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;ltd=">5G Ultra Wideband.

No? Well it doesn&#39;t really matter anyway, because the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1480602635">Uber Watch app</a> has effectively been discontinued, according to <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/01/10/you-cant-hail-an-uber-from-your-apple-watch-anymore?"><em>Apple Insider</em></a>. If you try to use it, a message pops up asking you to switch the mobile app instead. It further states &quot;we no longer [sic] supporting the Apple Watch app. Sorry for the inconvenience,&quot; with a crying emoji to drive the point home.&nbsp;</p><p>The app has yet to be pulled from the Watch App Store, but all you&#39;ll get is the error message if you try to use it.

More advanced functions like fare-splitting were reserved for the smartphone app.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The grammatically challenged message suggests that the app may have been pulled with some haste, though neither Uber or Apple have commented. The App Store listing (above) touts the app as a way you can leave home without your smartphone and still hail a ride, provided you had a cellular-enabled Watch. To be fair, Uber also pulled its WearOS app back in 2019, likely due to a lack of usage.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uber-has-dropped-hailing-support-on-the-apple-watch-114057975.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7aa51e6a-2663-4c92-9fd2-784acb44e8dd</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 11:40:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641907405</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T13:23:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dba4c1c0-72ce-11ec-83f3-c5e4f7746fb6" width="1023" height="658" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dba4c1c0-72ce-11ec-83f3-c5e4f7746fb6" width="1023" height="658" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Uber has dropped hailing support on the Apple Watch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Uber has dropped hailing support on the Apple Watch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple will allow third-party payments for apps in South Korea]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple will soon allow developers to use alternative payment systems for their apps in South Korea to comply with the country&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/south-korea-law-app-store-alternative-payments-114504007.html">new law</a>. According to <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20220111000624"><em>The Korea Herald</em></a>, the tech giant has turned in its plans on how its app store would support third-party payments to the Korea Communications Commission. It reportedly didn&#39;t include details on when the changes to its store will take effect and how much it will charge for its service fees exactly. However, the company did say that its cut for alternative payment transactions will be smaller than 30 percent.&nbsp;</p><p>South Korea passed a law — dubbed the &quot;anti-Google law&quot; — last year that requires major app stores like Google&#39;s and Apple&#39;s to allow third-party payment methods. It was a blow to the tech giants that typically keep a tight grip on their app stores. Both of them are even grappling with lawsuits challenging the commission they take from developers. Their most high-profile legal battle is perhaps the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-app-store-payment-changes-delay-epic-games-201026068.html">one with Epic</a>, which started after the video game developer tried to work around the companies&#39; 30 percent commission by offering discounts to users who purchase in-game currency directly from its portal.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new Korean law states that companies will face fines if they refuse to comply and force developers to use their payment systems only. Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-alternate-payment-south-korea-134255092.html">submitted</a> its initial compliance plans shortly after the law took effect in September, revealing that it will lower its commission by four percent for transactions that don&#39;t use its own payment system. As for Apple, we&#39;ll likely hear more information in the coming months. A spokesperson said in a statement:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We look forward to working with the KCC and our developer community on a solution that benefits our Korean users. Apple has a great deal of respect for Korea&#39;s laws and a strong history of collaboration with the country&#39;s talented app developers. Our work will always be guided by keeping the App Store a safe and trusted place for our users to download the apps they love.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-allow-third-party-payments-south-korea-105542247.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49d5e913-3cbe-455f-b738-db9d570a6eb0</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 10:55:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641898189</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T10:50:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/4f1fb860-3083-11eb-9cff-f671bf61fd0c" width="4000" height="2668" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/4f1fb860-3083-11eb-9cff-f671bf61fd0c" width="4000" height="2668" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - 2020/11/20: People entering the Apple store in Seoul, following the release of iPhone12 mini and iPhone12 Pro Max.

Volkswagen, BMW, Ford and Honda agreed to work with California on voluntary targets, but GM, along with Fiat Chrysler and Toyota, sided with the Trump administration.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;[GM] is committed to emissions reductions that are aligned with the California Air Resources Board&#39;s targets and... complying with California&#39;s regulations,&quot; GM VP Omar Vargas wrote in a letter to California governor Gavin Newsom.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of its past decision to side with the Trump administration, GM was <a href="https://thedriven.io/2019/11/20/california-blacklists-gm-toyota-and-other-car-makers-opposing-clean-car-rules/">banned by California</a> in 2019 for government fleet purchases. &quot;Carmakers that have chosen to be on the wrong side of history will be on the losing end of California’s buying power,&quot; Newsom said at the time. Now, the state will allow GM to become a supplier, with Newsom <a href="https://eu.detroitnews.com/story/business/autos/general-motors/2022/01/09/gm-recognizes-calif-emission-standards-opening-door-fleet-sales/9153355002/">welcoming</a> the company to its &quot;clean vehicle revolution.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>After defeating Trump, President Joe Biden announced a plan to accelerate a transition to EVs in order to combat global warming. GM followed those political winds, renouncing the earlier lawsuit and accelerating its own EV plans. The company now says it will stop selling ICE vehicles by 2040 and will spend <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-self-driving-ev-investment-35-billion-035316455.html">$35 billion</a> to develop EVs and self-driving cars by 2025.

The jump puts the country further behind meeting the reduction targets put forward by the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-rejoin-paris-agreement-official-190909769.html">Paris climate agreement</a>. Under the deal, the US has pledged to reduce its greenhouse emissions between 50 percent and 52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. As of last year, they were 17.4 percent below that benchmark. That’s a step back from the 22.2 percent reduction the country had achieved the year prior.</p><p>Behind the increase in overall emissions were corresponding jumps in pollution generated by the country’s transportation and power sectors. Compared to 2021, those sectors generated an additional 10 percent and 6.6 percent of greenhouse emissions. Driving those increases was a 17 percent increase in reliance on coal-generated power and more people driving after a pandemic-related downturn.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The report underscores how important is it is for the US to clean up its power grid and transportation sector.

The Canakkale region of Turkey hosts more than 1000 operating wind turbines. In November, Turkey's installed wind power capacity reached 10,585 megawatts making it the second-largest renewable capacity after hydropower. In October, Turkey ratified the Paris Climate Agreement, becoming the last country in the G-20 group to do so and setting an aim for net-zero emissions by 2053 and a focus on new climate initiatives. However, gas and coal continue to be the primary fuel sources in the energy sector, forcing the government to shift towards renewables, such as geothermal, hydropower, wind and solar energy. Over recent years, Turkey has increased installed capacity of renewable sources of energy as it endeavors to cut its near total dependence on imported petroleum products. Oil and gas imports, much of which are used to generate electricity, have become a significant strain on foreign exchange reserves especially as the country deals with a dire economic crisis with the Turkish lira losing more than 40 percent of its value against the U.S dollar this year. However according to Turkey's Energy and Natural Resources Minister Fatih Donmez, Turkey’s power capacity in renewable energy reached approximately 53,000 megawatts at the end of October, and, on November 11, electricity production from wind power hit a historic daily record, generating 20.1 percent of total power. Turkey’s renewable energy capacity is predicted to grow by 50 percent from 2021 through 2026, according to a recent report by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Would it?</p><p>Very clearly, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:VideoMic Go II" href="https://fave.co/3zMxjgm">VideoMic Go II</a> was designed to sit atop a camera. That’s just a fact, but with USB and 3.5mm outputs and compatibility with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rode-connect-podcasting-app-000034018.html">Rode Connect</a> – the company’s USB-friendly podcasting app – it turns out this lightweight, $99 mic could be more versatile than it first seems.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>If you <em>are</em> looking for a mic for your DSLR, know that the VideoMic Go II has a cold shoe mount, the aforementioned 3.5mm out (which can also be used for monitoring) and it comes bundled with a Rycote shock mount and a windscreen in the box. There’s no secondary/safety/stereo recording here or on-mic gain control, but that’s normal for something in this price range.</p><p>Performance-wise, the sound is surprisingly rich for a mic of this size without sounding too “dead.” There’s no notable difference between the audio you get out of the USB port compared to the 3.5mm port bar a little variation in gain. When comparing it against Rode’s VideoMic Me and VideoMic NTG, the VideoMic Go II might well be my favorite of the bunch. It’s natural, focused with just the right amount of ambiance/sense of space.</p><p>Where the VideoMic Go II gets more interesting is how it performs in <em>other</em> use cases. When plugged into a computer and placed on a desk the VideoMic Go II sounds just as robust as far more expensive dynamic microphones. So much so it threw me for a moment.</p><p>Perhaps the best illustration of this is when I tested it against the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$400" href="https://amzn.to/3FhXugn">$400</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/advanced-podcast-buyers-guide-part-1-143053492.html">Shure SM7B</a> and Rode’s own $99 <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:NT USB Mini" href="https://amzn.to/3Fj0cC9">NT USB Mini</a>. Given that both of the Rodes in this test are condenser microphones and cost about the same, you might think those two would be the nearer match, but it turns out that the VideoMic Go II sounded <em>much</em> closer to the SM7B. This isn’t to say it’s as good as the SM7B (there’s a little more depth in the Shure and a touch more dynamic range perhaps) but given the disparity in price, it definitely wasn’t expected.</p><p>This similarity is further compounded when you consider that the different type of capsule – Rode’s condenser versus Shure’s dynamic – alone would typically give them a very different sound. You can hear all three microphones in the sample below. It starts with the Shure, then the VideoMic Go II and then the NT Mini. The transition between the first two is subtle, yet the last one is obvious. Oh, and the VideoMic Go II was about two inches further away from my mouth than the SM7B was.</p><div id="3a616b0aa8e14bbeb2a3a29b0803f3b3"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/0FsbAY7" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Of course, this is just one test, in one scenario in one specific room. But for a quick comparison of what a $400 mic can do off the cuff compared to a $99 one, it’s a good starting point. Despite the lack of on-device controls, there are some configurable options via Rode Central. When connected to the app (mobile or desktop) you’ll have the option to tweak the gain level, apply a high pass filter / high-frequency boost and adjust the monitoring volume. It’s less convenient than physical on-mic controls, but still allows you some control over how it sounds or responds to different inputs. (If you&#39;re wondering, the audio above starts with the SM7B and switches to the VideoMic Go II at &quot;two condenser microphones&quot;).</p><p>Given that Rode added compatibility for Connect, and the USB option makes it phone and tablet-friendly, suddenly the VideoMic Go II could very well be a good all-rounder for the price. A mic that has video chops but can also do double duty as a podcast mic (and, therefore an all-purpose computer mic) there appears to be a lot of bang for the veritable buck.</p><p>Of course, if you really do need something that records a safety channel, has physical variable gain controls or if XLR connectivity is a must, this isn’t the one to go for. But for most general creator uses? It finally might not entirely “depend on what you’re recording.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/rode-video-mic-go-ii-230059221.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c854d539-d36a-4adc-9d4f-cb7a68e3f8bc</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 23:00:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641911053</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T14:24:20+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/949e6580-720e-11ec-bbff-a73905ec9d03" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/949e6580-720e-11ec-bbff-a73905ec9d03" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Rode VideoMic Go II - a new versatile shotgun microphone.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Rode VideoMic Go II]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surgeons successfully transplant genetically modified pig heart into human patient]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a desperate effort to save the life of a 57-year-old man, doctors at the University of Maryland School of Medicine have accomplished a medical first. Per <a href="https://apnews.com/article/pig-heart-transplant-6651614cb9d73bada8eea2ecb6449aef?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter"><em><ins>The</ins></em><ins>&nbsp;</ins><em><ins>Associated Press</ins></em></a>, this past Friday, surgeons successfully transplanted a pig heart into a patient as part of an experimental procedure.</p><p>In doing so, they showed a genetically modified animal organ could survive and function within the human body without immediate rejection. Three days after the procedure, David Bennett, the individual who underwent the surgery, is alive and “doing well,” according to the hospital.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Food and Drug Administration authorized the procedure on compassionate grounds. Bennett was ineligible for a traditional heart transplant and had run out of other options. “It was either die or do this transplant. I want to live. I know it’s a shot in the dark, but it’s my last choice,” he said in a statement before doctors operated on him.</p><p>Scientists have tried to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-25-transplant-organs-from-human-pig-hybrids.html">save humans with animal organs</a> for decades. One of the most notable attempts occurred in 1984 when doctors grafted a baboon heart into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby_Fae"><ins>Stephanie Fae Beauclair</ins></a>, an infant born with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. The congenital disorder left her body incapable of circulating blood properly. Baby Fae, as she was better known, survived for 21 days before her body eventually rejected the transplanted organ.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/10/health/heart-transplant-pig-bennett.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, what makes this latest procedure different is doctors used a heart that had been genetically modified to remove four genes that encode a molecule that causes the body to reject the orphan organ. They also inserted six human genes to make the immune system more tolerable of the foreign tissue. Whether the experiment represents a breakthrough will depend on what happens next. Bennett’s body could still reject the pig heart. For the moment, however, he’s alive, and doctors are understandably excited about what this could mean for patients.</p><p>“If this works, there will be an endless supply of these organs for patients who are suffering,” Dr. Muhammad Mohiuddin, scientific director of the University of Maryland School of Medicine’s xenotransplantation program, told <em>The Associated Press</em>. That would be a dramatic change from the status quo. According to the <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/organ-donation-statistics"><ins>Health Resources and Services Administration</ins></a>, more than 100,000 people are on the national transplant waiting list, and 17 individuals die every day waiting for an organ transplant.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pig-heart-transplant-successful-224645097.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5d986fd5-07f6-4b25-b6e9-3af10ae57eef</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 22:46:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641854809</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T22:46:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tests & Procedures]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/740d3a10-7265-11ec-bdd6-7a20f2bea132" width="5040" height="3346" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/740d3a10-7265-11ec-bdd6-7a20f2bea132" width="5040" height="3346" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Thierry Dosogne via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Surgeons team operating heart]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[surgeons]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer reneges on its claim the Zephyr mask uses 'N95-grade' filters]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Razer has removed any mention of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/project-hazel-razer-zephyr-201208975.html">Zephyr</a> and recently announced <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-zephyr-pro-announcement-180037042.html">Zephyr Pro</a> smart face masks including “N95-grade” filters from its website and other marketing materials. “The wearable by itself is not a medical device nor certified as an N95 mask,” a Razer spokesperson told Engadget. “To avoid any confusion, we are in the process of removing all references to ‘N95 Grade Filter’ from our marketing material.”</p><div id="ff06b3d3ced04acd9224c9fcf3c658c3"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve taken feedback and guidance from regulatory agencies to establish our testing protocols for the Razer Zephyr and Razer Zephyr Pro.

The 3D-printed attachment snaps onto the left thumbstick. When it&#39;s placed on a surface (or one&#39;s thigh), physically moving the entire controller will move the thumbstick.

You can <a href="https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/110609-one-handed-dualsense">download the files </a>and print attachments for personal use.</p><p>The adapter could also prove useful for gamers who don&#39;t typically have issues using the DualSense with both hands. In a video, Kuumeri demonstrates the ability to play <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ea-originals-hazelight-it-takes-two-hands-on-160009642.html"><em>It Takes Two</em></a>, a co-op-only game, solo by using attachments on two controllers.

He was thinking about the original show when he drove an underpass and inspiration hit. &quot;I knew I had a story to tell,&quot; he said at the time.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Peacock" href="https://fave.co/3GfSbzg">Peacock</a> will release the first three episodes of Bel-Air on Super Bowl Sunday, with subsequent episodes to follow weekly.

It has a 6.45-inch, 431 PPI external display with a resolution of 2560 x 1080, 120Hz refresh rate and 21:9 aspect ratio. Open it up, and users can access a 7.9-inch, 381 PPI display, which has a 2272 x 1984 resolution, 90Hz refresh rate and 10:9 aspect ratio.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both OLED screens are a little larger than the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">Galaxy Z Fold 3&#39;s</a> respective displays and support a 100% DCI-P3 color gamut. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/honor/">Honor</a> claims the Magic V is the first foldable smartphone with IMAX Enhanced certification.</p><p>The company says its water-drop hinge helps make the display appear &quot;creaseless.&quot; Oppo uses a similar style of hinge in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oppo-find-n-foldable-phone-china-101211924.html">recently announced Find N foldable</a>.</p><div id="0f82d096d1cc46c481da3ab59020f066"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2wbmWxjbBPY?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The Magic V is 72.7mm wide and 14.3mm thick when folded, and when opened, those dimensions shift to 141.1mm wide and 6.7mm thick. Its 160.4mm tall case houses a 4,750mAh battery that supports 66W charging. Honor says you can fully charge the battery in 40 minutes or to 50 percent of its capacity in just 15 minutes.</p><p>The phone has five cameras in total. The rear three-camera array has a wide camera, ultra wide camera and what Honor calls a &quot;spectrum enhanced camera.&quot; All three are 50MP sensors. There&#39;s a 42MP selfie camera for each screen too.</p><p>The Magic V runs on Qualcomm&#39;s new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-8-gen-1-announcement-230024192.html">Snapdragon 8 Gen 1</a> chipset, which has a 5G modem and Adreno 730 GPU built in. The Magic V has 12GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, dual-SIM support and stereo speakers. It uses Honor’s new Magic UI 6.0, which is based on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/honor-smartphones-google-apps-50-series-huawei-171758485.html">Android 12</a>. There&#39;s also an independent security chip, which stores passwords and biometric data such as fingerprints.</p><p>The device has three color options: black, space silver and burnt orange. At 293g, the silver and black models weigh slightly more than the 288g orange variant. The Magic V will only be available in China at the outset. The 256GB model costs ¥9,999 (approximately $1,568) while the 512GB version is ¥10,999 (around $1,725). The Magic V will go on sale on January 18th.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/honor-magic-v-foldable-smartphone-153214121.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2edaca1a-5999-4657-9019-555c96559da9</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 15:32:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641829919</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T15:52:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e9d5d9c0-7227-11ec-beb7-6ed522d6a1e6" width="704" height="407" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e9d5d9c0-7227-11ec-beb7-6ed522d6a1e6" width="704" height="407" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Honor]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Honor's Magic V foldable smartphone in silver, orange and black variants.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Honor's Magic V foldable smartphone in silver, orange and black variants]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirTags are cheaper than usual in Woot's latest one-day sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>AirTags are some of the most affordable Apple gadgets you can get, which is probably why deep discounts on them are hard to come by. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtag-is-the-cheapest-its-ever-been-at-amazon-153819504.html">Last week</a>, we saw one of the trackers drop to $24 and a four-pack fall to $96 on <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3qdSW6p">Amazon</a>, but Woot&#39;s latest flash sale makes the bundle even cheaper. Today only, you can get a four-pack of AirTags for $94, which is five percent off its normal price.

When you do misplace something, you can force the AirTag to emit a chime or, if you have an ultra-wideband supporting iPhone, the Precision Finding feature can lead you directly to your missing stuff using directions on your phone&#39;s screen. And if you&#39;re not the in vicinity of your belongings anymore, you can check out the AirTag&#39;s last location in the Find My app and even turn on Lost Mode, which will ping you when the AirTag gets detected by the network again.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Keep in mind that you&#39;ll have to be an iPhone user to get the most out of AirTags.

The 13-inch laptop with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is $150 off right now, bringing it down to $1,150. Only the space gray model has this discount right now, but the silver version is $100 off and down to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$1,199" href="https://amzn.to/3qbWTZi">$1,199</a>.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/334Nk5A" id="a1e8c4797c0445f386e120220cb18bf0" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Pro M1 at Amazon - $1,150</a><p>Keep in mind that this is the 2020 model — not the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:2021 MacBook Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3zHNPyd">2021 MacBook Pro</a>, which features an updated design with more ports and Apple&#39;s higher-end M1 Pro or M1 Max chipsets. That&#39;s not to say the 2020 model doesn&#39;t have its merits. In fact, it earned a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/macbook-pro-m1-review-163011742.html">score of 84</a> from us when we first reviewed it thanks to its speedy performance, fast GPU, lovely display, comfortable keyboard and trackpad plus its long, 16.5-hour battery life. And since the Pro is unlike the Air and has a fan inside, it can handle sustained workloads like video encoding better.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There are a few downsides to the Pro M1, namely its support for only one external display and lack of external GPU support all together. And, when compared to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-book-pro-14-16-inch-review-2021-apple-mighty-macs-130011975.html">2021 models</a>, the port selection is lacking. The 2020 laptop only has four Thunderbolt ports, whereas you&#39;ll get connectors like an HDMI port, an SD card slot and more on the newer machine. However, those updated MacBook Pros start at $1,999, so this sale on the 2020 MacBook Pro is a good option for those who have a tighter budget but still want an upgraded laptop and feel comfortable skipping the extra ports.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-2020-macbook-pro-m1-is-150-off-at-amazon-134059747.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">174574bc-1977-47e1-a66b-41e87d0c3b8a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:40:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641822060</ingested><modified>2022-01-10T13:41:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d37e0460-3eeb-11eb-b7f9-449e864b9135" width="1957" height="1213" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d37e0460-3eeb-11eb-b7f9-449e864b9135" width="1957" height="1213" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple's latest MacBook Pro with an M1 chip.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[MacBook Pro M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Take-Two is acquiring mobile game giant Zynga for $12.7 billion]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>PC gaming Giant Take-Two has <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220110005389/en/Take-Two-and-Zynga-to-Combine-Bringing-Together-Best-in-Class-Intellectual-Properties-and-a-Market-Leading-Diversified-Mobile-Publishing-Platform-to-Enhance-Positioning-as-a-Global-Leader-in-Interactive-Entertainment">announced</a> that it&#39;s making a big move into mobile gaming with the acquisition of Zynga for a total price of approximately $12.7 billion. Take-Two already owns Rockstar Games and 2K, producing games like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/grand-theft-auto-trilogy-re-release-gta-3-vice-vity-san-andreas-rockstar-games-155826052.html"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a>, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, <em>Bioshock</em> and others.

The deal will also help Take-Two save about $100 million annually after two years.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zynga itself was on an acquisition streak of late, having acquired the studio behind <em>Torchlight 3</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/zynga-echtra-games-185252730.html">early last year</a>. Zynga has sometimes relied on acquisitions to find the hottest games in the notoriously fickle mobile gaming market. Still, Take-Two said that the mobile industry booked $136 billion 2021 and is currently growing at over 8 percent, so the money is there to be had. Mobile will now account for half of its net bookings (net amount of products and services sold digitally or sold-in physically), the company said.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/take-two-is-acquiring-mobile-game-giant-zynga-131758269.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a891ca4-ce25-4c66-a824-d8237a713b6f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2022 13:17:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641898666</ingested><modified>2022-01-11T10:57:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/c3b7aa50-b4a8-11e9-bffe-a8e72b416ecc" width="3500" height="2299" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/c3b7aa50-b4a8-11e9-bffe-a8e72b416ecc" width="3500" height="2299" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Robert Galbraith / Reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Zynga logo is pictured at the company's headquarters in San Francisco, California April 23, 2014.

We last saw the iPhone SE in 2020, running on the A13 Bionic.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-se-5g-spring-2022-event-151352071.html%20https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><p><strong>Sponsored by Verizon</strong></p><p><a href="https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N2998.4294324YAHOOADTECHLLC/B26980868.324488828;dc_trk_aid=517043007;dc_trk_cid=163975568;u=TV2_PAI~DC_IMI~_DSP~_BID~;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=;ltd=">5G Ultra Wideband.

It’s affecting Honda and Acura models with GPS navigation systems manufactured between 2004 and 2012, with reports of people encountering the problem in the US, UK and Canada. What’s more, there doesn’t appear to be a fix at the moment. Each time someone starts their car, the clock resets — even if they manually set it beforehand.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/honda-2002-gps-bug-190248626.html%20https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ikea-symfonisk-second-generation-speaker-193506498.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">IKEA and Sonos refresh their Symfonisk bookshelf speakers</a></h2><h3>Faster processors, updated button layout and longer power cables.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonos-ikea-symfonisk-second-generation-speaker-193506498.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f216ad40-7208-11ec-bb9e-c5311af7a566" alt="TMA" data-uuid="0196cfa4-a309-3d0a-b233-7d1aafdd966a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure></a><p>IKEA and Sonos have released a second-generation version of their Symfonisk bookshelf speaker.
