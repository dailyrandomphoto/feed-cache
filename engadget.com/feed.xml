Some players feel the detachable controllers are a bit small for their hands. Many players miss having a regular D-pad. Whatever your reasons for wanting to upgrade your Switch controller situation, know that there are alternatives — it’s just a matter of picking the one that fits your needs. We tested out a bunch of Switch controllers to see which are worth your money.</p><h2>For casual gaming: Joy-Cons</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/fedbf520-b70c-11ea-b5f7-4b676ea0ed7d" alt="Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>Honestly, there’s a lot to like about the included Joy-Cons. They come right in the box and can be separated from the system so two people can play. The system also includes a special gamepad grip so you can hold them in your hand like any standard controller. So if you are in fact, happy with your Joy-Cons, there’s no need to switch them out. Just tweak them a little depending on your needs. Find them a tad too small? <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:FastSnail&#x002019;s matte rubber shells" href="https://amzn.to/3AWdCSX">FastSnail’s matte rubber shells</a> can make them a little easier for large hands to hold, and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hori&#x002019;s Analog Caps" href="https://amzn.to/3szOFcT">Hori’s Analog Caps</a> can make the thumb sticks grippier.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3AWdCSX" id="165bb9e542ee46e4929cbbc34f0817f5" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy FastSnail grips at Amazon - $14</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3szOFcT" id="24d8076612314c338cd949aeddf836b1" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Hori analog caps at Amazon - $9</a><p>There’s really no good way to replace the Joy-Cons entirely with a third-party copy. Some Joy-Con-like controllers won’t connect wirelessly, while others lack key features like vibration or an NFC reader. But there are some tradeoffs that are worth it. For example, if you like to play a lot of 2D platformers in handheld mode, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Hori&#x002019;s D-pad controller" href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-D-Pad-Controller-Mario-Officially-Licensed/dp/B01AI0GLJK?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=cctbuyersguide21-20&amp;linkId=2a04ce4ebec72336c640709fe326be7d&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl">Hori’s D-pad controller</a> will restore the beloved cross-shaped directional button to your gameplay. If you’re looking for something that’s also more comfortable in your hand, the company’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$50 Split Pad Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3ARNI2G">$50 Split Pad Pro</a> is also worth a look. It has a D-pad on the left side and a more ergonomic grip than your standard set of Joy-Cons. But it also makes the entire assembled Switch a lot chunkier.</p><p>If you like to play your Switch with groups (or you’ve experienced the dreaded “drift” issue), chances are you’ve picked up one or two extra pairs of Joy-Cons. Which means you’re going to need a place to charge the spares. PowerA makes an excellent <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$25 charging station" href="https://amzn.to/3suORtL">$25 charging station</a> that can be plugged into your Switch dock (or any device with a USB port) and handles four Joy-Con-like controllers at once — that includes third-party gamepads as well as Nintendo’s own Switch-compatible NES controllers (see below).</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/HORI-D-Pad-Controller-Mario-Officially-Licensed/dp/B01AI0GLJK?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=cctbuyersguide21-20&amp;linkId=2a04ce4ebec72336c640709fe326be7d&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" id="7cf77477e01b453b9ec620fb662eb490" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Hori D-pad controller at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3ARNI2G" id="20f5a4b1ad6448d490f769dfe9d3f059" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Split Pad Pro at Amazon - $88</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3suORtL" id="552ad00a8dc84228bda55be515981e06" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PowerA charging dock at Amazon - $25</a><h2>For action-packed games: Pro-level controllers</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/824ed110-b70e-11ea-a930-d4e643dbdacb" alt="Nintendo Switch Pro Controller" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>Sometimes you just want a standard controller to play your favorite action titles — and standard in 2020 means something like you’d get packed in with an Xbox, with grips for the heels of your hands, shoulder buttons and triggers, two thumb sticks, a set of four buttons on the right and a D-pad on the left. Nintendo knows that, which is why it created the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Pro Controller" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAWKYZ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=buyersguide2021-20&amp;language=en_US">Pro Controller</a>. This first-party gamepad pairs easily with the Switch and features a D-pad on the left, while still maintaining features like the infrared sensor and vibration that might go missing on third-party alternatives. The only downside is the $70 price, but avid players of games like <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> will appreciate the refined controls and increased comfort.</p><p>While you can plug your Pro Controller directly into your Switch dock to charge, it’s not the most elegant solution. PowerA also makes an attractive <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$25 dock" href="https://amzn.to/3xXI90w">$25 dock</a> that accommodates both Joy-Cons and the Pro Controller, which should keep your gaming area nice and tidy.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAWKYZ0/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=buyersguide2021-20&amp;language=en_US" id="902971f09c77412e84713a600659796b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Pro Controller at Amazon - $70</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xXI90w" id="c53ee8e68e7643a8b0c42bad30e8d84d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PowerA dock at Amazon - $25</a><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/a5dcfd50-b70e-11ea-beff-f17a637298b5" alt="PowerA Nintendo Switch Pro Controller" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>When the price of the Pro Controller is a bit rich for your blood or out of stock, PowerA makes its own version with the same arrangement of buttons. The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Enhanced Wireless Controller" href="https://amzn.to/3xVTJt9">Enhanced Wireless Controller</a> skips the rechargeable battery in favor of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:AAs" href="https://amzn.to/2YvqfUq">AAs</a>, which has its downsides, but at least when it runs low on juice you can just pop in a new pair of batteries and get right back to gaming. Unfortunately, there’s no USB-C port to connect with so you’ll have to pair the device wirelessly — which can be finicky and may take a few tries before your Switch recognizes the controller. It also lacks vibration, so you won’t get tactile feedback in games where it’s helpful. And the plus and minus buttons are placed a bit closer to the center, so those with smaller hands will have to reach a bit further to press them.</p><p>If you’d prefer not to have to recharge — or buy batteries for — your gamepad, PowerA also makes a <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:wired version" href="https://amzn.to/3meLoyG">wired version</a> of the same controller that connects via USB. It’s got the same look and feel, but you won’t have to struggle as much with getting your console to recognize it, and there’s no potential for wireless lag, making it ideal for fast-paced shooters and fighting games. The included cord is 10 feet long so it should reach most couches just fine.</p><p>While most third-party controllers tend to mimic the Xbox style of gamepad, anyone more familiar with the PlayStation’s distinctive DualShock design will probably prefer the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$50 Pro 2 from 8BitDo" href="https://amzn.to/3xSTrmJ">$50 Pro 2 from 8BitDo</a>. The retro-styled controller has the same general layout as the classic SNES gamepad, but adds twin thumb sticks, palm grips, back buttons, control remapping and even sensitivity adjustments. It’s truly the Swiss Army knife of Switch controllers.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xVTJt9" id="6d26d9c3bce64d42ab3b8b72a9ba8a85" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Enhanced Wireless controller at Amazon - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3meLoyG" id="fb8cbc19a5b34dc7a9df0e0c2d97183a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy PowerA wired controller at Amazon - $23</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3xSTrmJ" id="64f0cd38ccb140dbacb3ebfe31fe788d" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 8bitdo Pro 2 at Amazon - $50</a><h2>For old school gaming: Niche and retro controllers</h2><figure><img src="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-06/1064ad40-b70e-11ea-a37f-e099d7f62310" alt="PowerA GameCube-style controller for Switch" data-uuid=""><figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figcaption></figure><p>Twenty years later and the preferred controller layout for Super Smash Bros. players is still the one made for the GameCube, which is why today it’s still possible to buy new gamepads straight from Nintendo.

Ultimate Edition GameCube Controller</a> is identical in layout and design to the original gamepads, though now it connects via USB so it can be used with the Switch. The only downside to the reissue is that it doesn’t come in a bold shade of purple anymore.</p><p>However, if you’re still sporting a classic GameCube controller with its proprietary connector, you can also pick up an adapter that will let your Switch accommodate up to four old-school gamepads. Nintendo sells one on its store, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Y Team controller adapter" href="https://amzn.to/3AOJBnS">Y Team controller adapter</a> is also a good alternative that costs less and can be bought at Amazon.</p><p>But you might not want to be tethered to your console — especially if you have fond memories of kicking back on your couch with a Wavebird in hand to play GameCube games like <em>Super Smash Bros.

If you’re subscribed to Nintendo Online, you have access to over 100 classic titles, so you might want a more “authentic” controller to use with them. Nintendo Online subscribers can buy retro-style wireless gamepads directly from the company, though the <a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-entertainment-system-controllers.html">$60 set of two small</a>, rectangular NES controllers will remind you why we’ve moved on from that design. The dog-bone shape of the <a href="https://store.nintendo.com/super-nintendo-entertainment-system-controller.html">$30 SNES model</a> is more hand friendly and can still be used with the NES games, so it’s a better use of your funds should you decide you want to recreate your childhood gaming experiences.</p><p>If you don’t need an exact copy of your beloved childhood gamepads it’s worth looking at 8BitDo instead: It makes a variety of classic-styled controllers that add just enough modern features to make them useful for a wider variety of games. Its models are almost all wireless, and there are some design changes to make the controllers more comfortable and easier to use. We’ve already recommended the DualShock-like Pro 2, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$45 SN30 Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3k3QHhJ">$45 SN30 Pro</a> also offers features like dual thumb sticks and vibration in the dog-bone controller style.</p><p>If you’re looking for something more portable, however, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$25 8BitDo Lite" href="https://amzn.to/2XGUw4Z">$25 8BitDo Lite</a> is smaller and swaps out the thumb sticks for two D-pads, keeping the four button arrangement on each side. It’s great for 2D games and it even matches the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-8bitdos-latest-switch-controller-ditches-thumbsticks-for-dual-d.html">color scheme</a> of the Switch Lite.&nbsp;</p><p>Before you try any of the controllers listed in this guide, remember to update your Switch to the latest firmware — the 8BitDo controllers will run on any version, but the PowerA gamepads need your system to run at least version 6.0.0.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/2VXl4yn" id="284687668bd1482e8b7e8a616f5e6f40" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Nintendo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy NES controller pack at Nintendo - $60</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/2UqUywk" id="db9b92a9b1144a82ae6eaf32a423786f" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Nintendo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy SNES controller at Nintendo - $30</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3k3QHhJ" id="4b2445b09cdd4cc1ac927ad4ad74c257" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy SN30 Pro at Amazon - $45</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/2XGUw4Z" id="7c823c795f2b4a8cb0b8433f53749841" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 8bitdo Lite at Amazon - $25</a><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/best-nintendo-switch-controllers-160034389.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">061a64f7-f700-3ab7-bd52-51c3b52edbcd</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 14:00:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629295368</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T14:03:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[gaming]]></category><category><![CDATA[nintendo]]></category><category><![CDATA[8bitdo]]></category><category><![CDATA[thebuyersguide]]></category><category><![CDATA[nintendoswitch]]></category><category><![CDATA[gamepads]]></category><category><![CDATA[commerce]]></category><category><![CDATA[sn30]]></category><category><![CDATA[powera]]></category><category><![CDATA[hori]]></category><category><![CDATA[switch]]></category><category><![CDATA[splitpadpro]]></category><category><![CDATA[procontroller]]></category><category><![CDATA[feature]]></category><category><![CDATA[controllers]]></category><category><![CDATA[joy-cons]]></category><category><![CDATA[sn30pro+]]></category><category><![CDATA[gear]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e81da260-002c-11ec-86a7-3261231674cc" width="1600" height="899" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e81da260-002c-11ec-86a7-3261231674cc" width="1600" height="899" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The best Switch controllers for every player level]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Laser-powered fusion energy inches closer to reality]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scientists have just edged closer to a fusion energy system that doesn&#39;t lean on magnetic field-based <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kstar-fusion-device-sets-record-210817623.html">tokamak reactors</a> or twisty <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-04-stellarator-fusion-reactor-online.html">stellarators</a>. <em>Science</em><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/explosive-new-result-laser-powered-fusion-effort-nears-ignition">reports</a> that a team at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has <a href="https://www.llnl.gov/news/national-ignition-facility-experiment-puts-researchers-threshold-fusion-ignition">achieved</a> a breakthrough in laser-powered fusion energy by coming much closer to &quot;ignition,&quot; or a blast that produces an excess of energy.</p><p>The researchers sparked the event with a 20-nanosecond burst from 192 laser beams aimed at a tiny sphere full of the hydrogen isotopes deuterium and tritium, itself housed in a small gold cylinder. The laser shot vaporizes the gold, producing x-rays that implode the capsule and create fusion. The experiment produced 70 percent ignition, or 1.35 megajoules of the 1.9MJ from the laser. That&#39;s well short of what you&#39;d need from a fusion energy source, but eight times more powerful than the lab had managed before.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It will take a while for the research unit to further refine the process and achieve full ignition.

If there&#39;s further progress, the technique could produce effectively &#39;unlimited&#39; energy that could solve the electrical grid&#39;s capacity issues while remaining clean and safe.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/laser-powered-fusion-energy-breakthrough-134058739.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b23d0ea8-6bdd-4263-9228-d8240623b8f1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:40:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629293111</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T13:25:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/09b80b60-0021-11ec-973a-5b55e45fdf64" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/09b80b60-0021-11ec-973a-5b55e45fdf64" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Laser beams produce x-rays that implode to create fusion]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Laser beams produce x-rays that implode to create fusion]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Holoride’s in-car VR gaming system leaves the track for the real world]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="e5d3dcd837024cfbbe3d277e5427e3f7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WWVmkAICPYw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Holoride’s VR gaming system for passengers caught our attention <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-07-audi-backseat-vr-disney-marvel.html">a few years back at CES</a> when we were given a ride in an Audi on a track and had the game react to the movement of the vehicle while we played. Well, the company is back and this time they demoed two games and threw off the shackles of the track for the real world.</p><p>We took a ride in an Audi with the Holoride system and again enjoyed video games while someone else drove. The company is currently courting developers to build games via their recently announced SDK and are partnering with automakers to make sure that the data they need from the car to make their games a reality is available.

The visual discovery website has introduced hair pattern search, it said, with BIPOC users in mind. This new feature uses computer vision-powered object detection to enable users to refine their searches by six different hair patterns: protective, coily, curly, wavy, straight and shaved/bald.</p><p>Now, after users search for broader terms like &quot;summer hairstyles,&quot; &quot;glam hair&quot; or &quot;short hair,&quot; they&#39;ll find new hair pattern buttons that will narrow down the results. The feature is now live in the US, UK, Ireland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand on desktop, as well as on iOS and Android. It will roll out to more locations over the coming months.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yes, there are different types of curls, not to mention different hair textures and porosities, and Pinterest said its technology detected hair patterns in over 500 million images on its platform. Being able to refine results could help POC users find styling inspiration more easily instead of having to wade through pages and pages of hair images that wouldn&#39;t work for their hair types. That said, it remains to be seen how accurate the feature is and if it&#39;s truly effective in sifting through images on the website.</p><p>According to the company, this feature builds on its first inclusive product that allows users to search for images based on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-skin-tone-search-updates-161657313.html">subjects&#39; skin tones</a>. It worked with BIPOC creators and popular Pinners like <a href="https://www.pinterest.ph/NaeemahLaFond/">Naeemah LaFond</a> to design the product.</p><p>Pinterest&#39;s Head of Inclusive Product Annie Ta said in a statement:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Our mission on the Inclusive Product team is to help everyone feel like Pinterest is a place for them. As a visual discovery platform, we have an opportunity and responsibility to do a better job of increasing representation in the products we build. That&#39;s why we built hair pattern search using computer vision technology to help identify hair patterns in images. By doing this, we hope we&#39;re able to use technology for good and make it easier for people, no matter who they are, to find hair inspiration for them on Pinterest.&quot;</p></blockquote><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b4a75e60-001a-11ec-bfef-cb4e28508bdc" style="height:1000;width:750;" alt="Pinterest" data-uuid="25f15e7a-8cea-3a1b-843a-9fc7417350f9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Pinterest</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/pinterest-hair-pattern-search-130002097.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c2ac252-b8c3-48bd-85d3-1d9820f5bbe5</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:00:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629288275</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T12:04:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Hair Care]]></category><category><![CDATA[Beauty]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e0f86b0-0016-11ec-9fbf-49df31c82b48" width="1600" height="1064" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7e0f86b0-0016-11ec-9fbf-49df31c82b48" width="1600" height="1064" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Pinterest]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Pinterest]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Pinterest]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Jabra's latest earbuds are for people with mild-to-moderate hearing loss]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A number of companies make <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-14-assistive-hearing-wireless-earbuds-bragi-nuheara.html">&quot;hearing enhancement&quot; devices</a> that look more like a set of earbuds than a piece of clinical tech. Nuheara has been a staple at CES with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-nuheara-iqbuds2-max.html">IQbuds line</a> and companies like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aids-152746656.html">Bose</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-01-08-bragi-project-ears-hearing-aids-tinnitus.html">Bragi</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-05-olive-union-smart-ear-hands-on.html">Olive</a> and others have offered <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-15-upgrade-your-hearing-with-technology.html">a mix of tech and hardware</a> to assist with hearing loss. Even Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-features-ios-15-180549807.html">plans to introduce a &quot;Converstaion Boost&quot;</a> for its AirPods Pro. Since the FDA allows companies to sell directly to consumers with mild-to-moderate hearing loss without the need for a prescription, the list of options is constantly growing. Another company that&#39;s specifically equipped to blur the line between hearing aid and true wireless earbuds is Jabra, thanks to the auditory assistance expertise of its parent company GN.&nbsp;</p><p>With the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Jabra Enhance Plus" href="https://fave.co/2W6Pn53">Jabra Enhance Plus</a>, the company offers a more approachable device for people who may not need what all-day hearing aids offer just yet. Jabra describes these earbuds as &quot;a miniaturized true wireless form factor&quot; that&#39;s 50 percent smaller than its stellar <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-23-jabra-elite-75t-review-specs-features.html">Elite 75t</a> model. Those are already some of the smallest buds I&#39;ve tested, so reducing the size even further makes the Enhance Plus more comfortable and more discreet. Plus, a design that resembles earbuds rather than a traditional hearing aid helps reduce the stigma around wearing something that helps your hear better.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Inside, four separate sound processing features work to improve audio quality. The Enhance Plus analyzes sound to keep things as natural as possible while also reducing noise for speech clarity. The earbuds also ensure feedback doesn&#39;t hinder amplification and they isolate sounds coming from in front of you.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/505c8fb0-ffbc-11eb-9bfd-ec1ab9582668" alt="Jabra Enhance Plus" data-uuid="82a97309-19eb-3a9c-bf58-193ba002e456"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Jabra</div></figure><p>In addition to providing hearing enhancement, the Jabra Enhance Plus can work just like a set of true wireless earbuds to play music and take calls. Similar to other earbuds, the Enhance Plus comes with multiple sizes of ear tips to help you find the best fit, on-board controls and water/dust resistance (IP52). Jabra says they&#39;ll last 10 hours on a charge with 30 hours total when you factor in the charging case. An app assists with setup and offers a degree of customization.&nbsp;</p><p>Jabra plans to launch the Enhance Plus at &quot;select hearing care clinics&quot; in the US &quot;towards the end of the year.&quot; A licensed professional will conduct a hearing test to make sure these earbuds are appropriate. There&#39;s no word on pricing just yet, but the company says it&#39;s applying for approval under the FDA&#39;s self-fitting category. If you&#39;re looking for more of a true hearing aid rather than these &quot;enhancers,&quot; Jabra also offers the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Enhance Pro" href="https://fave.co/37Vvvoc">Enhance Pro</a>. It carries the more traditional behind-the-ear hearing aid design along with a charging case. It&#39;s also pricey, starting at $1,800.&nbsp;</p><p>If that&#39;s what you&#39;re after, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bose-soundcontrol-hearing-aids-152746656.html">Bose SoundControl hearing aids</a> went on sale in May in a handful of states. That device puts the company&#39;s audio expertise to use to help you hear better, and Bose said it was the first FDA-cleared hearing aids that could be sold directly to consumers. What&#39;s more, they&#39;re more affordable at $850, but they run on the typical zinc-air batteries for hearing aids rather than being rechargeable.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-enhance-plus-earbuds-130001782.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47866dfa-cf8e-43e3-bc2f-ea7ce82bf125</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 13:00:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629295575</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T14:10:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Disease & Medical Conditions]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7dba3930-ffb2-11eb-bdab-ad9c957ba6c1" width="1600" height="1068" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/7dba3930-ffb2-11eb-bdab-ad9c957ba6c1" width="1600" height="1068" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jabra]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Enhance Plus]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Enhance Plus]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Roku devices are back on sale at Amazon, including the Streambar for $99]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, we saw a number of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roku-streambar-99-deal-amazon-roku-streaming-devices-sale-134034742.html">Roku streaming devices</a> receive big discounts on Amazon — including the Roku Streambar, which went down to $99.

It also works as a Bluetooth speaker as well, but we found the device sounded better when watching action movies than when playing our favorite pop playlists.</p><p>The other discounted Roku products are best for those aren&#39;t as interested in an audio upgrade as they are in streaming power that comes in a small package. The Streaming Stick+ has ended up in many of our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-budget-home-entertainment-streaming-devices-cheap-tvs-for-students-123020749.html">home entertainment guides</a> thanks to its affordability and relatively comprehensive feature set.

The Express 4K+ is very similar, but it supports smooth wireless connectivity instead of long-range.

The Play-Fi Home Theater system connects TVs to external speakers over WiFi. The first compatible TVs should arrive in the third quarter of 2021 (in other words, by the end of October).</p><p>The company says Play-Fi Home Theater won&#39;t require manufacturers or customers to add any additional hardware to their TVs. If you&#39;d rather not use the TV&#39;s built-in speakers, you can still wirelessly output the center channel audio to a compatible soundbar or front speakers. The system can automatically adapt to the number of speakers you connect to the TV, and you can build out your setup with more speakers later.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The system, which builds on DTS&#39; long-standing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Play-Fi"><ins>Play-Fi protocol</ins></a>, can connect several other speakers, including up to two subwoofers, for surround sound. You can also play audio from your TV elsewhere in your home if you have a <a href="https://play-fi.com/news/dts-play-fi-arrives-on-tvs"><ins>multiroom setup</ins></a>. In addition, you can listen to audio from your TV through headphones via an app.&nbsp;</p><p>The Play-Fi Home Theater approach isn&#39;t entirely new. Sony has enabled customers to use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-ht-a9-home-theater-system-140038379.html"><ins>compatible TVs&#39; built-in speakers</ins></a> as their surround sound setup&#39;s center channel for a while.

Apparently, some older versions of QNX have a BadAlloc vulnerability, which gives bad actors a way to attack systems remotely. The infiltrators could then execute a denial-of-service attack or execute arbitrary code. BlackBerry, the FDA and US Homeland Security&#39;s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (<a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-229a?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">CISA</a>) have issued advisories about the flaw. According to <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/17/blackberry-qnx-vulnerability-hackers-505649"><em>Politico</em></a>, though, BlackBerry originally didn&#39;t want to go public about it and kept it a secret for months.</p><p>The company reportedly told CISA that it didn&#39;t believe its OS was affected by BadAlloc, which is a group of memory allocation vulnerabilities Microsoft <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/04/29/badalloc-memory-allocation-vulnerabilities-could-affect-wide-range-of-iot-and-ot-devices-in-industrial-medical-and-enterprise-networks/">found</a> in April affecting a wide range of industrial, medical and enterprise networks. A number of companies publicly revealed being affected by the flaw shortly after Microsoft&#39;s report came out, but BlackBerry wasn&#39;t one of them. <em>Politico</em> says it was CISA that confirmed that some older QNX versions are indeed affected by BadAlloc, and it was the agency that eventually convinced the company to go public.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apparently, the agency was worried that most QNX users wouldn&#39;t even know their systems are affected, because BlackBerry licenses the OS to manufacturers. The company originally wanted to privately reach out to those customers about the issue, but that means end users won&#39;t find out unless manufacturers tell them, as well. In the end, CISA was able to convince BlackBerry that a public announcement is the best course of action.</p><p>In its <a href="https://support.blackberry.com/kb/articleDetail?articleNumber=000082334">notice</a>, BlackBerry said it&#39;s &quot;not aware of any exploitation of this vulnerability.&quot; Both the company and CISA are advising organizations using QNX for their products to roll out updates that will patch the flaw regardless. The FDA also <a href="https://www.mddionline.com/regulatory-quality/blackberrys-cybersecurity-flaw-may-affect-your-medical-device">issued a warning</a> specifically for medical devices running the OS, though it said it wasn&#39;t aware of any confirmed events related to BadAlloc.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blackberry-qnx-cars-medical-devices-vulnerable-110746229.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">491e0991-835f-46ca-89ca-637f629a287c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 18 Aug 2021 11:07:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629283689</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T10:48:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/549cd1d0-0006-11ec-babc-7166331d09b9" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/549cd1d0-0006-11ec-babc-7166331d09b9" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Megias via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[CPU vulnerability. 3D render. hacked processor concept]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[CPU vulnerability. 3D render. hacked processor concept]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile confirms data breach affects over 47 million people]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of its ongoing data breach <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-confirms-data-breach-203719462.html">investigation</a>, T-Mobile has confirmed the enormity of the stolen information. Roughly 47.8 million current and former or prospective customers have been affected by the cyberattack on its systems, the carrier confirmed on Wednesday. Of that number, about 7.8 million are current T-Mobile postpaid accounts and the rest are prior or potential users who had applied for credit, the company added in a <a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Shares-Additional-Information-Regarding-Ongoing-Cyberattack-Investigation/default.aspx">press release</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Worryingly, the data includes some personal information including the first and last names, date of birth, SSN, and driver’s license/ID information for a &quot;subset of customers.&quot; So far, T-Mobile said it does not have any indication that the stolen files contain phone numbers, account numbers, passwords or financial information.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>What&#39;s more, the company said about 850,000 active T-Mobile prepaid customers also had their names, phone numbers and account PINs exposed. The affected users do not include Metro by T-Mobile, former Sprint prepaid, or Boost users and T-Mobile said it has reset the PINs on these accounts. In addition, it claimed that &quot;some additional information&quot; from inactive prepaid accounts was accessed through prepaid billing files.</p><p>The findings from the carrier&#39;s preliminary analysis come just days after it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-data-breach-investigation-202913474.html">notified</a> of a data breach. Initially, it was reported that a member of an underground forum claimed to have obtained the data for over 100 million T-Mobile customers. The culprit was reportedly selling information of about 30 million T-Mobile customers for about $270,000 in Bitcoin.&nbsp;</p><p>As part of its compensation and mitigation efforts, T-Mobile is offering affected customers two years of McAfee’s ID Theft Protection Service; recommending all postpaid users change their PIN; and setting up an online resource page.

Elliot Carter, a recreational mapmaker, contacted law enforcement after his site about Washington, D.C.&#39;s underground infrastructure witnessed a spike in activity from suspicious websites. His warning eventually made it to the highest ranks of the Capitol Police, according to a new investigation by <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/investigations/dc-tunnel-history-site-flagged-suspicious-activity-before-capitol-insurrection/2775341/"><em>News4 I</em></a>.</p><p>Normally a mecca for local history buffs, the <a href="https://www.washingtontunnels.com/">Washington Tunnels</a> website Carter oversees was flooded with nationwide visitors in the days before the insurrection. A deeper review of the traffic analytics revealed that many of the clicks were coming from hyperlinks shared on anonymous message boards, sites and forums named after militias or firearms, or using Donald Trump’s name. Though the initial interest originated from the deepest and darkest recesses of the web, it eventually transitioned onto popular social media sites, including Twitter.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Washington Tunnels website itself was a labor of love.

When a dead body is found, everyone who’s still alive convenes to voice their suspicions and vote who they believe committed the crime.

It was never a truly mainstream product, though, and ASI VP Kent Tibbils told <em>CRN</em> that there were few customers buying RealSense cameras in any significant quantities.

CEO Pat Gelsinger wants Intel to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-foundry-7nm-plan-analysis-141532580.html">reclaim the chipmaking crown</a>, and that means concentrating its resources on design and manufacturing capabilities.

The company has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628702/google-pixel-6-charger-not-included">confirmed</a> to <em>The Verge</em> that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">Pixel 6</a> won&#39;t include a charger in the box. Like its peers, Google claims there&#39;s just no need — most people already have USB-C chargers, the company says.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html">Pixel 5a</a> should be Google&#39;s last phone with an in-box power brick. We&#39;ve asked Google if it can comment on the subject.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While Google didn&#39;t touch on this directly, companies have historically justified removing the charger as an eco-friendly move. Apple, Samsung and others can not only produce fewer chargers overall and reduce e-waste, but ship phones in smaller boxes that allow for more devices per shipment (and thus fewer trips).</p><p>As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVPM6D-3aZo">critics</a> have observed, though, that advantage is debatable — if you do need to buy a charger, you may create more waste by ordering a charger from another company. Others have speculated that it&#39;s a cost-cutting move. Companies can hide (or at least mitigate) rising phone costs by removing a sometimes-redundant accessory.</p><p>Either way, your options for included chargers are shrinking. You may have to turn to brands like Xiaomi (which offers a &#39;free&#39; charger for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-11-snapdragon-888-221003638.html">the Mi 11</a>) if you&#39;re determined to get a brick at no extra charge. Otherwise, you&#39;ll likely have to resign yourself to buying at least one separate charger to keep your phone topped up.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-will-not-include-charger-200203294.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3c6fe0bf-d733-4c2b-b1dd-d104c0ebf40f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 20:02:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629230525</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T20:34:23+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/50fe6e70-ff8f-11eb-ba7f-37ef7ae7cec5" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/50fe6e70-ff8f-11eb-ba7f-37ef7ae7cec5" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro in multiple colors]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro in multiple colors]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Snapchat Trends is an overview of the most popular keywords in use in Stories]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Snap is introducing a new tool called <a href="http://trends.snapchat.com/?_gl=1*10dtsrf*_ga*NDIyMTczMzgxLjE2MjkyMjQwNjc.*_ga_MVLHFV2K4K*MTYyOTIyNDA2Ni4xLjAuMTYyOTIyNDA2Ni42MA.."><ins>Snapchat Trends</ins></a> that provides a public overview of the most popular keywords currently in use on the app. Accessible via the <a href="http://trends.snapchat.com/?_gl=1*1qqk79s*_ga*NDIyMTczMzgxLjE2MjkyMjQwNjc.*_ga_MVLHFV2K4K*MTYyOTIyNDA2Ni4xLjAuMTYyOTIyNDA2Ni42MA.."><ins>company’s website</ins></a>, you can use the feature to get a sense of the topics that Snapchat users are referencing in Stories they share with the public and their friends.

Apple has warned that SharePlay won&#39;t be available in the launch versions of iOS 15, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-os-15-public-beta-preview-191514417.html">iPadOS 15</a>, tvOS 15 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html">macOS Monterey</a>. You&#39;ll get that shared viewing experience through software updates arriving this fall, but the new beta 6 <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/">releases</a> (public and private) don&#39;t include it.</p><p>Apple told Engadget it would continue to give developers access to SharePlay in order to incorporate the feature into their apps. To that end, the company has released a SharePlay profile for app makers who don&#39;t want to disrupt their work.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It may still be worth installing iOS 15 beta 6, though. Apple has further <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fix-safari-tab-bar-design-third-ios-15-mac-os-monterey-beta-180648751.html">fixed Safari</a> by introducing a redesigned tab bar — no more having to access common features through an overflow menu. You can also move the address bar back to the top if you&#39;re a traditionalist. It&#39;s not quite a reversion to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ios-14-review-130053409.html">iOS 14</a> way of doing things, but it is an acknowledgment that many weren&#39;t fans of the original iOS 15 approach.</p><p>This wouldn&#39;t be the first time Apple reserved a feature for a post-launch update.  The company didn&#39;t even release <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-28-ios-13-1-review.html">iOS 13</a> for the iPod touch and HomePod until 13.1 was available. Still, it&#39;s worth noting if you play to upgrade to iOS 15 quickly — Apple is more interested in polishing iOS 15 than trying to fulfill all of its promises on day one.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-delays-ios-15-shareplay-184450766.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">79b2f5d5-382a-4f0a-ba09-a02aca02e8f1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 18:44:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629225893</ingested><modified>2021-08-18T00:36:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f21ed3b0-ff82-11eb-bcf5-db7b17ce6029" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f21ed3b0-ff82-11eb-bcf5-db7b17ce6029" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iOS 15 beta on iPhone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iOS 15 beta on iPhone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[California watchdog alleges T-Mobile misled regulators to obtain Sprint merger approval]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>T-Mobile misled state regulators about its planned CDMA network shutdown to gain approval for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-t-mobile-completes-sprint-merger.html">2020 merger</a> with Sprint, according to a <a href="https://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M398/K955/398955746.PDF">ruling</a> from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC). As first reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/t-mobile-apparently-lied-to-government-to-get-sprint-merger-approval-ruling-says/"><em>Ars Technic</em>a</a>, the watchdog ordered the carrier on Friday &quot;to show cause why it should not be sanctioned by the commission&quot; over providing &quot;false, misleading, or omitted statements.&quot;</p><p>One of the main ways T-Mobile won regulatory approval for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-t-mobile-completes-sprint-merger.html">$26 billion acquisition</a> of Sprint was by agreeing to sell Boost Mobile to a competitor. In 2020, Dish paid <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dish-acquires-boost-mobile-wireless-carrier-171217646.html">$1.4 billion</a> to acquire the Sprint prepaid brand from the carrier. As part of the deal, T-Mobile agreed to provide 4G LTE and 3G CDMA service to Boost customers while Dish worked on moving them over to a 5G network it was building on its own. Initially, T-Mobile said it would support those customers until 2023, but the carrier&#39;s current CDMA plan will see it shut down that part of its network on January 1st, 2022. That&#39;s in 137 days as of the writing of this article.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The CPUC lists five contradicting claims from T-Mobile, one of which involves a statement the carrier made that Dish would have up to three years to migrate Boost Mobile customers. The watchdog can fine T-Mobile up to $100,000 per offense. While that&#39;s unlikely to hurt the carrier, it could lead to additional scrutiny from the CPUC. &quot;The discrepancy between information in T-Mobile&#39;s testimony and information provided in its response is so serious that it warrants further investigation by this commission,&quot; the watchdog said. T-Mobile will have a chance to answer the CPUC&#39;s allegations during a hearing on September 20th.</p><p>T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert responded to the ruling in a <a href="https://www.t-mobile.com/news/un-carrier/for-t-mobile-5g-connectivity-means-that-no-one-is-left-behind">lengthy blog post</a> the carrier published last week. &quot;Listen, this is a manufactured crisis, orchestrated by Dish, and it is about money, not customers,&quot; he said. &quot;If Dish was really concerned for customers, they would simply take real action and get their customers new phones on time, before the network upgrade happens, just as T-Mobile is doing for affected Sprint customers.&quot;</p><p>To that point, Dish has said the number of customers involved, in combination with the ongoing global chip shortage, makes it impossible to migrate them all to a 5G device before T-Mobile shuts down its CDMA network early next year. &quot;A forced migration of this scale under this accelerated time frame is simply not possible and will leave potentially millions of Boost subscribers disenfranchised and without cell service come January 1st, 2022,&quot; the company said in a letter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dish-fcc-letter-t-mobile-212911598.html">to the Federal Communications Commission back in April</a>.</p><p>We&#39;ve reached out to both T-Mobile and Dish for additional comment.</p><p>The CPUC ruling follows a recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-09/u-s-doj-has-grave-concerns-about-t-mobile-network-shutdown">July 9th letter</a> the Department of Justice sent to T-Mobile and Dish. The agency said it had &quot;grave concerns&quot; over the impending shutdown and the possibility that a significant number of Boost Mobile customers would be left without service on January 1st, 2022. The DoJ said it expected both companies &quot;to take all available steps&quot; to remedy the situation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-california-public-utilities-commission-ruling-175759982.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">2ef83af3-5b0e-4ec7-a9c8-8b5c18ee6b1b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 17 Aug 2021 17:57:59 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629223083</ingested><modified>2021-08-17T19:43:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Utility Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/19b011a0-ff83-11eb-babb-df24c0f29ea7" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/19b011a0-ff83-11eb-babb-df24c0f29ea7" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terroa via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Berlin, Germany - November 27, 2014: T Mobile Sign at building in Berlin.
