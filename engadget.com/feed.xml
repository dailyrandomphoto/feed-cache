As with its past releases, the startup plans to first sell the food to restaurants, with supermarket availability to follow later. But before all that, it will debut them at a trade show next week.</p><p>One thing that will distinguish the nuggets from Impossible’s past products is the absence of <a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/ca/heme"><ins>heme</ins></a>, a molecule the company says is what makes “meat taste like meat.” But the problem with Impossible’s heme is that the company makes it with <a href="https://impossiblefoods.com/ca/blog/how-gmos-can-save-civilization-and-probably-already-have"><ins>genetically engineered yeast</ins></a>. That’s something that has prevented Impossible from selling its burgers and sausages in China and throughout Europe. But when it comes to real chicken, there isn’t a lot of heme in the white meat of the animal. “We found in a nugget format, which is breaded and has some seasoning, it really wasn’t that necessary.” Laura Kilman, a flavor scientist with Impossible, told <em>Bloomberg</em>. The formula the company eventually settled on mostly makes use of soy protein and sunflower oil.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-27-kfc-beyond-fried-chicken-popular.html"><ins>Compared to Beyond Meat</ins></a>, Impossible Foods is late to offer a chicken alternative. “We’ve been busy with other things,” Dennis Woodside, the company’s president, told <em>Bloomberg</em>. To that point, Impossible introduced a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-impossible-pork-taste-test.html"><ins>pork substitute at CES 2020</ins></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>All the same, that might not matter much. Earlier in the week, Popeyes announced it was <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/popeyes-adds-chicken-nuggets-to-its-menu-after-wildly-successful-sandwich-180022434.html"><ins>adding chicken nuggets to its menu</ins></a> in hopes of replicating the success of its chicken sandwich. The latter sparked a “war” between fast food chains as demand for chicken increased in the US and throughout the world. That&#39;s something that could help Impossible when its plant-based chicken starts making its way to consumers.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/impossible-foods-chicken-nuggets-190923352.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f11e52bb-dcfa-44f4-a77e-3b45df795d41</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 19:09:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626462566</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T19:09:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Food & Cooking]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44a148e0-e668-11eb-bfbd-fd6583f9cd21" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44a148e0-e668-11eb-bfbd-fd6583f9cd21" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Impossible Foods]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Impossible Foods chicken nuggets]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Impossible Foods chicken nuggets]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's AirPods Max hit record low of $449 at Adorama]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There&#39;s a lot to love about Apple&#39;s AirPods Max, but their high price tag isn&#39;t one of them. At $550, they&#39;re more expensive than even competitors from Bose and Sony, but you can get the cans for $100 less right now at Adorama. The online retailer is having a sale on all available colors of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:AirPods Max" href="https://fave.co/3BdDjiM">AirPods Max</a>, dropping them to $449. That&#39;s the best price we&#39;ve seen on these headphones and $30 less than the sale going on at <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3xYLy0d">Amazon</a> right now.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Buy AirPods Max at Adorama - $449" href="https://fave.co/3BdDjiM">Buy AirPods Max at Adorama - $449</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Despite how expensive they are, AirPods Max earned a spot on our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-headphones-150030794.html">favorite headphones</a> list thanks to their excellent sound quality, comfortable fit and good active noise-cancellation, among other things. They have an eye-catching design, but it doesn&#39;t impede their comfort — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-max-review-143019326.html">we liked</a> their breathable mesh fabric and large ear cups. They also have a rotating crown of sorts for onboard controls, and while that may be unfamiliar to some, it&#39;s quite reliable and easy to use.</p><p>AirPods Max sound more natural than other headphones we&#39;ve tested, and they have bass that&#39;s prominent but not overpowering. While we prefer the ANC quality of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM4" href="https://amzn.to/3Bb9OxQ">Sony&#39;s WH-1000XM4</a>, AirPods Max can hold their own, blocking out most environmental noise. And just like other AirPods, the Max have Transparency Mode so you can easily join conversations when you need to and quickly go back to jamming out at your desk with no distractions. While these headphones won&#39;t support Apple&#39;s lossless audio, they do support Dolby Atmos-powered spatial audio on iPhones, iPads, Macs and soon, Apple TV as well.</p><p>The kicker for most people when it comes to AirPods of any kind is the H1 chip, which allows them to quickly pair with and switch between Apple devices. The Max has this chip, so you&#39;ll be able to use them to go from taking a call on your iPhone to listening to music from your Mac without any hiccups. While the sale price remains high in comparison to competing headphones, a $100 discount is nothing to scoff at. This sale is a good opportunity to grab the AirPods Max at a much friendlier price if you&#39;ve had your eye on them since launch.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-max-sale-100-off-adorama-184943075.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">60453195-080c-427c-855f-e7537804e2db</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 18:49:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626461388</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T18:50:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Hobbies & Personal Activities]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/dd1abe50-cab9-11eb-8cff-bd62f32bad9b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/dd1abe50-cab9-11eb-8cff-bd62f32bad9b" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Max]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods Max]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rivian delays its electric R1T pickup and R1S SUV to September]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Rivian was supposed to start deliveries of its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-cold-weather-testing-171527674.html"><ins>R1T</ins></a> Launch Edition electric pickup truck <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-r1s-suv-delivery-dates-151911858.html"><ins>this month</ins></a>, but that won’t be the case.

Google has <a href="https://blog.google/products/android/emoji-day-redesign-easier-sharing/">previewed</a> updates to &quot;hundreds&quot; of characters for the new OS that will also make them more accessible across apps and platforms.

The bikini emoji doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s being worn. Food emoji like the croissant and shrimp look like they&#39;ve been cooked properly. The camping tent emoji cleverly reflects day or night depending on your OS theme. And the mask emoji no longer looks like a sick person — it&#39;s a pandemic-era acknowledgment that wearing a mask shows kindness and respect.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You&#39;ll also see emoji that are more functional and easier to read, such as a more realistic motorway character and larger vehicles.</p><p>You&#39;ll have an easier time using the new emoji, too. From Android 12 onward, apps that support Google&#39;s Appcompat will always support the latest emoji without requiring separate updates. Better emoji functionality is also coming to many of Google&#39;s platforms, including consistent support in Gmail this July, a new emoji picker in Chrome OS the same month and improved functionality in YouTube chats later in 2021. All told, you won&#39;t have to worry so much about missing emoji or other challenges expressing yourself.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-12-emoji-update-170038659.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c3e3e339-2425-4a85-bedb-b4e396ce4d55</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:00:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626441800</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T13:23:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b5720080-e633-11eb-b7df-308f113e1711" width="1920" height="1083" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b5720080-e633-11eb-b7df-308f113e1711" width="1920" height="1083" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android 12 emoji selection]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Android 12 emoji selection]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Facebook’s betting $1 billion on creators]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last month, Instagram held its first-ever Creator Week, a virtual event the company described as “a life-changing three days with new feature news and celeb drop-ins.” One of those drop-ins was CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who made a brief appearance to share a message with creators.</p><p>“I think that any good vision of the future has to involve a lot more people being able to make a living by expressing their creativity and by doing things they want to do, rather than things they have to — and having the tools and the economy around them to support their work is critical,” he said. “Our goal is to be the best platform for creators like you to make a living.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This week, Zuckerberg went even farther, announcing that Facebook plans to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-billion-dollars-creators-instagram-live-streams-gaming-172537889.html">invest $1 billion</a> in creators by the end of 2022. The investment will fund bonus programs, creator funds and other monetization programs to boost all stripes of creators on its platform.</p><div id="97a3043e74eb4e0397818008f98a9e66"><iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fzuck%2Fposts%2F10113607549897721&amp;width=650&amp;show_text=true&amp;appId=205102269555384&amp;height=206" width="650" height="206" style="border:none;overflow:hidden;" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></div><p>That Facebook is funneling so much money and resources toward creators is indicative of not just the opportunity the company sees, but how much ground it has to make up.</p><p>For years, Facebook simply didn’t do much for creators. While Instagram has long had its own influencer community, the company has at times tried to limit their reach. Instagram’s founders were reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-no-filter-review-183023352.html">uncomfortable</a> with the rise of influencers, and introduced an algorithmic feed to ensure users would see more posts from friends and family than brands and businesses.</p><p>While YouTube has offered monetization features for more than a decade, Instagram didn’t offer any kind of revenue sharing feature until last year. And many creators often felt at odds with Instagram. The company’s ever-changing algorithm fueled suspicions that it “shadowbans” or otherwise penalizes users who post too much or about the “wrong” topics.</p><p>“Facebook has been late to the game in terms of supporting the creative community in a meaningful way,” says Qianna Smith Bruneteau, founder of the American Influencer Council, a trade group representing the creator industry.</p><p>But Facebook is now trying to reverse those perceptions. For the past year, the company has been steadily churning out new tools for creators to make money. Since last May alone, the company has introduced a dizzying number of money-making features.</p><p>On Instagram, creators can now make money from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-igtv-commercials-monetization-150000000.html">commercials</a> in IGTV or open their <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creators-challenges-affiliate-commission-193917455.html">own shops</a>. They can sell badges and products in live streams. On Facebook, they can host paid virtual events, promote fan subscriptions, or sell in-app gifts in live streams or audio rooms. Soon, they’ll be able to start paid newsletters, earn affiliate commission from products their followers buy and participate in a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creator-shops-content-marketplace-190211314.html">branded content marketplace</a>. The company is also launching several new <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/investing-1-billion-dollars-in-creators/">bonus programs</a> that will pay creators for signing up for IGTV ads, creating Reels or meeting live-streaming milestones.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/a9defc20-e64f-11eb-b4fc-3b94e6d814e9" alt="Creators can earn bonuses for meeting certain goals." data-uuid="b223570d-f426-33c3-83f3-fbe8e61f8301"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>Zuckerberg and other top executives now regularly speak about creators and the opportunity they represent. The company is so eager to win over the creator community it’s promised it won’t take a cut of their earnings until 2023.</p><p>Li Jin, founder of Atelier Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in the creator economy, says surging interest in creators is because the industry has gotten so big it’s no longer something platforms can afford to ignore.</p><p>“I think for a long time there was no need to separately think of creators as a distinct segment that was in need of specialized features or funds,” Jin says. “I think what changed is the realization that … these creators’ content is driving a disproportionate amount of activity and engagement on the platforms.”</p><p>That Facebook is late to the creator economy also means the company is facing an incredible amount of competition. TikTok, which has a reputation for a creator-friendly algorithm, just passed 3 billion downloads, the first non-Facebook owned app to do so, according to analytics company <a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/tiktok-downloads-3-billion">Sensor Tower</a>. Users of TikTok, and its Chinese counterpart Duoyin, together spent more than a half billion dollars in the app during the second quarter of 2021, alone. In the United States in 2020, TikTok was significantly ahead of Facebook and Instagram in user engagement, according to App Annie.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e4818370-e64f-11eb-9ffb-532e71b982f4" alt="TikTok is outpacing Facebook in time spent per user." data-uuid="ab8a8909-ad87-3039-b993-6ffb7ea3aae2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">App Annie</div></figure><p>Meanwhile Twitter, Snapchat, Pinterest and other platforms are also pouring money into new initiatives for creators. “There&#39;s a limited number of creators and everyone is in competition for them,” Jin says.</p><p>Facebook has offered various explanations for its sudden interest in creators. Zuckerberg has said he wants to help more people “make a living” off Facebook’s services. Instagram chief Adam Mosseri recently said the company was responding to “the shift in power from institutions to individuals across industries.”</p><p>It’s also a major opportunity to shift Facebook’s business away from ads. Though Facebook has promised it won’t take a cut of creators’ earnings for more than a year, that will eventually change (the company hasn’t said what its cut will be, only that it will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-creators-earnings-cut-2023-paid-events-newsletters-164341439.html">be “less”</a> than Apple’s 30-percent commission).</p><p>Creators could also provide a massive boost to the company’s push into shopping. Commerce has also been a major focus for the social network, which has already crammed shopping features into nearly every corner of Instagram, and Zuckerberg has said he intends to create “a full-featured commerce platform” across Facebook’s services.</p><p>What’s less clear is just how much creators will be willing to buy-in to Facebook’s vision. While a $1 billion investment will almost certainly fuel more interest in the platform, it’s not clear if it will prompt the kind of content Facebook might be hoping for. Instagram’s Reels, for example, was meant to be the company’s chief TikTok competitor. Yet the company has at times had to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-no-longer-a-photo-sharing-153127352.html">push creators</a> to post original content there.</p><p>And concerns about Facebook’s algorithms remain, says Bruneteau. “The algorithm should be favorable to creators like it is on TikTok,” she says. “You have these instant influencers on TikTok, who have been able to grow million-plus followings in less than a year. However those same instant influencers who have those accounts have a tendency to have less followers on Instagram.”</p><p>There are signs that Facebook might be willing to address these concerns. Mosseri recently raised eyebrows when he said that Instagram is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-no-longer-a-photo-sharing-153127352.html">no longer</a> a photo-sharing app, and that the company was working one ways to insert more recommended content in users’ feeds in order to compete with TikTok.</p><p>But even with a kinder <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/shedding-more-light-on-how-instagram-works">algorithm</a>, both Bruneteau and Jin caution that creators should be cautious in throwing too many resources into Facebook or any one platform.</p><p>“When creators are building their processes on top of these like centralized platforms, they&#39;re actually creating more value for the underlying platform than they&#39;re able to create for themselves,” Jin says. “At the end of the day you&#39;re strengthening Facebook&#39;s dominance because the more content you put there, the more it attracts consumer users and the more that translates into Facebook revenue and Facebook&#39;s network effects.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/why-facebook-is-betting-1-billion-on-creators-170006159.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3f345e92-36e4-4358-92f0-4dc4fcdefde7</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 17:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626454580</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T16:56:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/2a7fbe50-a28f-11eb-9bfd-fa2ef8df286c" width="3012" height="2008" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/2a7fbe50-a28f-11eb-9bfd-fa2ef8df286c" width="3012" height="2008" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Feb 16, 2020 Menlo Park / CA / USA - Girl posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign, located at the entrance to the company's main headquarters, Silicon Valley]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Girl posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[QuakeCon returns as an online-only event on August 19th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The 2021 edition of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/quakecon"><ins>QuakeCon</ins></a> will take place from August 19th-21st.

Canalys <a href="https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/global-smartphone-market-q2-2021?ctid=2143-0b9f92413ead631983febced55e12cd8">estimates</a> that the Chinese tech giant became the world&#39;s second-largest phone brand in the second quarter of 2021, surging 83 percent year-over-yer to claim 17 percent of the market. The company not only overtook Apple (14 percent) to claim the second spot, but blew past its BBK-owned Chinese rivals Oppo and Vivo, both of which held 10 percent. Samsung held on to its lead at 19 percent, but there&#39;s clearly not much of a gap.</p><p>The key, as you might guess, was price. Xiaomi&#39;s average selling prices are well below those of Samsung (40 percent) and Apple (75 percent), and even flagships like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-11-snapdragon-888-221003638.html">the Mi 11</a> are relatively affordable. That may have helped Xiaomi&#39;s strong international expansion, including a 300 percent jump in Latin America, a 150 percent spike in Africa and a 50 percent gain in Western Europe. And unlike its fallen competitor, Huawei, Xiaomi <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-removes-xiaomi-chinese-blocklist-094055806.html">doesn&#39;t have a US blacklisting</a> to cloud its future.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not certain that Xiaomi will hold on to its position. The second quarter is historically weak for Apple as it reaches the tail end of a given iPhone&#39;s release cycle. Canalys also notes that Oppo and Vivo aren&#39;t staying still — they have their own dreams of world dominance. And if Xiaomi hopes to escape its low-cost reputation, it needs phones like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-price-launch-date-134516642.html">Mi 11 Ultra</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-mi-11-ultra-price-launch-date-134516642.html">Mi Mix Fold</a> to resonate with the public.</p><p>Even a temporary second-place position would be notable, though. While Xiaomi has long had a major presence in its native China, the company has had a much tougher fight for international recognition. Now, it&#39;s large enough to battle with behemoths like Samsung and Apple — it&#39;s just a question of whether or not Xiaomi can become the frontrunner.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/xiaomi-second-largest-phone-brand-q2-2021-141814474.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c0a7c6c4-b0a4-4e8b-ba3d-44f4c84d7764</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 14:18:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626445097</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T14:18:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d02ca310-e63a-11eb-9dff-33015cba2899" width="5000" height="3343" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d02ca310-e63a-11eb-9dff-33015cba2899" width="5000" height="3343" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[HONG KONG, CHINA - 2021/03/31: Pedestrians walk past the Xiaomi Mi 11 5G smartphone advertisement at its flagship store in Hong Kong.

goldfish]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last April, Facebook’s AI research lab (FAIR) announced and released as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-chatbot-ai-open-source-blender-150001320.html">open source its BlenderBot social chat app</a>. While the neophyte AI immediately proved <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-03-23-microsofts-tay-ai-chat-bot.html">far less prone to racist outbursts</a> than previous attempts, BlenderBot was not without its shortcomings. For one, the system had the recollection capacity of a goldfish — any subject or data point the AI wasn’t initially trained simply didn’t exist in its online reality, as evidenced by the OG BB’s continued insistence that Tom Brady still plays for the New England Patriots. For another, due to its limited knowledge of current events, the system had a strong tendency to hallucinate knowledge, like a digital Dunning-Kruger effect. But the advancements <a href="https://parl.ai/projects/blenderbot2/">BlenderBot 2.0 displays</a>, which FAIR debuted on Friday, should make the AI far more sociable, knowledgeable, and capable.</p><p>While BlenderBot 1.0 could only maintain its memory for a single discussion, its successor can remember topics of conversation over the course of multiple talks that can take days, weeks or even months to complete thanks to the implementation of a long-term memory module. What’s more, the AI can actively update its knowledge base by searching the internet for the latest news and details on any subject that the user wishes to speak about.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“BlenderBot 2 queries the Bing API for search results based on a generated search query, and conditions its response on the top few results,” Kurt Shuster, Research Engineer at Facebook AI, told Engadget. “We rely on Bing to provide high quality search results.” As such, BlenderBot 2.0 is now capable of speaking coherently about breaking news and new media, not just the data it was trained upon.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ff16df40-e59c-11eb-8fbf-5a67dea986ff" alt="how blenderbot 2.0 works" data-uuid="e93943f0-a6fb-3611-8d83-f2c932c78604"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAIR</div></figure><p>“BlenderBot 2 is limited only by what a powerful search engine can provide,” Jason Weston, Research Scientist at Facebook AI, added. So for example, if you are more interested in learning about Tom Yewcic (the Patriot’s combo QB/Punter from the 1962 season) than you are about Tom Brady, BB 2.0 has you covered. It’s the same with more scholarly subjects, like photosynthesis or redox reactions, Weston continued. So long as the information is available on the web, “there is no reason BlenderBot 2 cannot discuss this.”</p><p>By actively searching the internet for information, BlenderBot 2.0 can also reduce the instances in which it hallucinates knowledge. “Providing the system with more commonsense reasoning will allow BlenderBot to make sure it does not confuse subtle concepts,” Weston explained, “such as a movie director versus a producer or a pitching coach versus a hitting coach.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e7dad7f0-e59c-11eb-bdff-3b3ec451d622" alt="the crown" data-uuid="c80ba4f5-4141-3abb-b112-a3df4148d87c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">FAIR</div></figure><p>The only wrinkle really occurs when discussing non-english based media, such as <a href="https://kimetsu-no-yaiba.fandom.com/wiki/Kimetsu_no_Yaiba_Wiki"><em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em></a>. “It is reasonable to conclude Bing will surface information about it and BlenderBot 2 can use that information accordingly,” he said. “We currently focus on english-based search results, so non-english references may not be fully covered.” The system will, however, recognize that <em>Demon Slayer</em> is of interest to you and will be more likely to bring up manga-centric subjects in future discussions.</p><p>FAIR has taken multiple steps to ensure that BlenderBot does not become the next Tay. “BlenderBot 2 does not learn directly from user input, as Tay did,” Shuster said. “We have taken extensive safety steps to ensure that BlenderBot 2 can handle adversarial users. Specifically, we employ both baked-in and two-stage techniques. BlenderBot 2 can detect itself if the incoming context will result in an offensive response, and additional safety layers where a safety classifier can detect if either the user input or the bot&#39;s output is offensive. Each handles the response appropriately.”</p><p>And while the system is currently focused on chewing its way through the English language corpus, FAIR does see BlenderBot does eventually extend to other languages as well. “While not in our immediate plans, the goal of our team is to build a superhuman conversationalist,” Shuster said. “This kind of agent requires multilingual understanding.”</p><p>Recent internal benchmarking processes found that BlenderBot 2.0 outperformed its predecessor by 17 percent in its engagingness score and 55 percent in its use of previous conversation sessions according to human evaluators, per a Friday blog from FAIR. What’s more, BlenderBot&#39;s rate of knowledge hallucinations dropped from 9 percent (!) in BB 1.0 down to just 3 percent in the current iteration.</p><p>Looking ahead, “humans interacting with AI systems via discourse is the future of AI,” Weston asserted, “and ensuring that humans have an engaging, informative experience is critical to that future. BlenderBot 2 combines the engagingness of BlenderBot 1.0 with the knowledge capabilities of a system with access to the entire internet, so ostensibly we are on the right track.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebooks-open-source-chatbot-no-longer-has-the-mental-fortitude-of-a-goldfish-133039125.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5ab7bbf8-97d3-4246-94d7-a37b5eca5009</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jul 2021 13:30:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626379744</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T20:09:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9cfb8e90-e59d-11eb-abef-299d17b46332" width="5390" height="3498" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9cfb8e90-e59d-11eb-abef-299d17b46332" width="5390" height="3498" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Aubrey via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Goldfish in Fish Bowl]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Valve made a $399 handheld gaming PC]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Valve just surprised us all with a handheld console. The $399 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html"><ins>Steam Deck</ins></a> will arrive in December, with availability expanding to more regions later.</p><p>Looking like some unholy alliance of Sega’s Game Gear and the Nintendo Switch, the hardware includes a seven-inch touchscreen at 1,280 x 800 resolution at 60Hz refresh rate. There is no shortage of control options either, with dual thumbsticks, two pretty large square trackpads, an old-school directional pad, four main face buttons, triggers and a quartet of grip buttons.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-181222143.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d3679c50-e596-11eb-beb1-13c0fd5f32a1" style="height:859;width:1657;" alt="Valve Steam Deck" data-uuid="b29fa5ba-abaf-30c9-83bb-bc70ff0d8bb1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Valve</div></figure></a><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it’s just shy of a foot long. Eesh. Valve has ensured there’s enough power inside to tempt PC gamers that already have an expansive Steam library. There’s an AMD 2.4-3.5GHz processor and a 1.0 to 1.6GHz GPU with eight RDNA 2 compute units.  There’s 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM inside, too. Valve promises a battery life of between two and eight hours on a single charge, depending on how much power you need for your games. Given the power many AAA PC games require, you can probably expect a lot of experiences to hover around the lower estimates.</p><p>While the Steam Deck might not be as powerful as your gaming PC, Valve is using Proton, a compatibility layer that lets games run without developers having to do any work porting titles across — you&#39;ll apparently have access to your full library of games. This price point makes it slightly more expensive than the Switch, and the same price as the digital-only PS5. Due to its Steam hooks, however, it’s a very different proposition. How well will PC games play on a seven-inch handheld?</p><p></p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-facecam-streaming-gaming-webcam-193052663.html">Elgato&#39;s first webcam has landed</a></h2><h3>It’s good hardware for streamers.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-facecam-streaming-gaming-webcam-193052663.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/0e44b360-e41d-11eb-9ffb-6999313f1231" style="height:1067;width:1600;" alt="Elgato FaceCam mounted on a monitor" data-uuid="69fa0608-41b8-3e32-8de2-2b018b10f74d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure></a><p>Elgato’s first $200 web camera isn’t all that unique.

The test comes in response to one of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-initial-judgments-141352775.html">first cases</a> the Oversight Board took up, which dealt with an Instagram post meant to raise awareness of breast cancer that the company removed under its nudity rules.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Facebook restored the post, saying its automated systems had made a mistake, and updated Instagram’s rules to allow for “health-related nudity.” But the Oversight Board had also recommended that Facebook alert users in cases when a post was removed with automation rather than as a result of a human content reviewer. Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-responds-oversight-board-recommendations-210841361.html">previously said</a> it would test this change, which is now in effect.</p><p>“We’ve launched a test on Facebook to assess the impact of telling people more about whether automation was involved in enforcement,” facebook writes in its report. “People in the test now see whether technology or a Facebook content reviewer made the enforcement decision about their content. We will analyze the results to see if people had a clearer understanding of who removed their content, while also watching for a potential rise in recidivism and appeals rates.” The company added that it will provide an update on the test later this year.</p><p>The report also shed some additional insight into how the company is working with the Oversight Board. The report notes that between November 2020 and March 2021 it referred 26 cases to the board, though it’s only chosen to take up three — one of which was in response to its suspension of Donald Trump. (Notably, the latest report only covers the first quarter of 2021, so it doesn’t address the board’s recommendations in response to Trump’s suspension.)</p><p>Though the Oversight Board has only weighed in on a handful of cases, its decisions have resulted in a few <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-satire-exception-community-standards-oversight-board-212257406.html">policy</a><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-hate-speech-194501894.html">changes</a> by Facebook that could have a much broader effect.

In a blog post, the company noted that “the size and scope of the board’s recommendations go beyond the policy guidance that we first anticipated when we set up the board, and several require multi-month or multi-year investments.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-notifying-some-users-whose-posts-were-removed-by-automation-212939760.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eef6f31a-662c-4e5a-bcc5-a2ce3f02cdf0</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 21:29:39 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626383698</ingested><modified>2021-07-15T21:15:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/f080ea20-147d-11eb-9f7f-8bd7d7c101e5" width="4396" height="2747" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/f080ea20-147d-11eb-9f7f-8bd7d7c101e5" width="4396" height="2747" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ANKARA, TURKEY - MAY 07: Facebook logo is seen on a smartphone as Oversight Board at the background in Ankara, Turkey on May 07, 2020.

Like many documentaries, the film pieces together archival footage, including interviews and show outtakes, to attempt to tell the story of its subject in their own words. It also includes words Bourdain never spoke to a camera before his death by suicide in 2018, and yet you’ll hear his voice saying them.</p><div id="39fe59c6d5294d6aa367c9a75824f2ef"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihEEjwRlghQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/annals-of-gastronomy/the-haunting-afterlife-of-anthony-bourdain"><em>The New Yorker</em></a>, the film’s director, Morgan Neville, said there were three quotes he wanted Bourdain to narrate where there were no recordings, and so he recreated them with software instead. “I created an AI model of his voice,” he told the magazine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It appears that was no easy feat either. In a separate <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/anthony-bourdain-morgan-neville-roadrunner-documentary">interview with <em>GQ</em></a>, Neville said he contacted four different companies about the project before deciding on the best one. That company fed about a dozen hours of audio to an AI model. A lot of the work involved deciding the exact tone of Bourdain’s voice Neville wanted the software to replicate since the way the author and travel host narrated his writing changed so much over the years he was on TV.</p><p>Compared to some of the other ways we’ve seen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-24-facebook-fact-check-nancy-pelosi-video.html">AI</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/netherlands-deepfake-video-chat-navalny-212606049.html">deepfakes</a> used to trick people, this isn&#39;t the worst example, but the ethics of it are still questionable. The film, as far as we’re aware, doesn’t include a disclosure that AI was used to replicate Bourdain’s voice. “If you watch the film, other than that line you mentioned, you probably don’t know what the other lines are that were spoken by the AI, and you’re not going to know,” Neville told <em>The New Yorker</em>. “We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later.”&nbsp;</p><p>In his interview with <em>GQ</em>, Neville said Bourdain’s family and literary executor told him “Tony would have been cool with that,” a fact Ottavia Bourdain, his widow, disputes. &quot;I certainly was NOT the one who said Tony would have been cool with that,&quot; she <a href="https://twitter.com/OttaviaBourdain/status/1415889455005716485?s=20">said on Twitter on Friday afternoon</a>. In a separate tweet, Bourdain told one of her followers her involvement in the documentary was limited to an interview and sharing some footage. After news of the film&#39;s use of AI started to spread online, Neville shared a follow-up statement with <a href="https://variety.com/2021/artisans/news/anthony-bourdain-fake-voice-roadrunner-documentary-backlash-1235020878/"><em>Variety</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“There were a few sentences that Tony wrote that he never spoke aloud,” he said. “With the blessing of his estate and literary agent we used AI technology. It was a modern storytelling technique that I used in a few places where I thought it was important to make Tony’s words come alive.” Representatives for the project claim the AI technology is used for less than 60 seconds throughout the film.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 07/16/21 1:25PM ET</strong>: Added comment from Ottavia Bourdain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/anthony-bourdain-roadrunner-ai-voice-210643678.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4545b5b5-a9fa-4c66-a419-6337001cd889</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jul 2021 21:06:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626457377</ingested><modified>2021-07-16T17:43:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Movies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/aff9d1e0-e5ad-11eb-bfdb-c92208e286e1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/aff9d1e0-e5ad-11eb-bfdb-c92208e286e1" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[CNN / Focus Features]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Anthony Bourdain]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Anthony Bourdain]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Candace Parker is NBA 2K's first female cover athlete]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Twenty two years after the debut of <a href="http://engadget.com/tag/nba%202k"><ins>NBA 2K</ins></a>, the basketball sim series will feature a woman on the cover of the game <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/nbar-2k22-features-candace-parker-as-first-wnba-cover-athlete-in-exclusive-edition"><ins>for the first time</ins></a>.

The one thing missing in this list was a webcam — until today’s introduction of the Elgato FaceCam.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/9152fdf0-e41a-11eb-9fef-b769a7c3e924" alt="Elgato FaceCam mounted on a monitor" data-uuid="15c721a4-696b-3560-8dc4-022955d0bc50"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>On its surface, the $200 camera is not that unique. It’s a chunky rectangular box that can be easily clipped on top of a monitor, or connected to Elgato’s multi mount system. It shoots 1080p at 60fps, with a Sony-made STARVIS CMOS sensor. It may not be 4K, but most streamers don’t need that kind of resolution right now. The FaceCam makes up for it with a robust suite of settings in its dedicated Camera Hub program. Yes, you’ll have to download another piece of software for this camera to run alongside Game Capture, Stream Deck, Wave Link (for the mics) and Control Center (for the lighting), which is a little annoying. Other companies bundle all their different drivers and settings into one tool, but I suppose keeping them separate probably makes sending out updates easier.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d4891b90-e41a-11eb-be87-513e555c8a2c" alt="It&#39;s a me on the screen" data-uuid="07af371b-5453-34d4-b3a7-0cdfc5f55f35"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>In the Camera Hub you’ll have easy access to things like contrast, exposure and white balance. (The latter two can be set to automatic so you have one less thing to fuss over.) The automatic white balance was a little warm for my taste, but it was easy enough to turn it off and knock the number down to a cooler 4000K. The software also comes with zoom options, but it’s nothing to write home about, as the camera is fixed focus. You’ll always be sharp as long as you always remain between 12 inches (30 cm) and 47 inches (120 cm) from the camera. That should take care of anyone working at a desk; anyone who moves further back would be better served with something a little more portable with advanced settings.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/8b53ffc0-e41b-11eb-bf7f-1f13788d7e5a" alt="Elgato Camera Hub, close up to my chin" data-uuid="ed278b57-c136-3246-84da-d22b9a270e2e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>The biggest draw of the Camera Hub is the real-time ISO reading, which makes it a lot easier to detect and react to changes in your lighting. Maybe your lights are too bright, or maybe the natural light from outside vanished with an oncoming thunderstorm (which is exactly what’s happening as I type this). The exposure and white balance can adjust automatically, or you can tweak the settings yourself on the fly. There’s a Stream Deck plugin available, which should make it possible to adjust the settings with the touch of a button. Of course, that’s dependent on you having smart lighting in the first place, like <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Elgato&#x002019;s Key Light" href="https://amzn.to/3wJcijR">Elgato’s Key Light</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Ring Light" href="https://amzn.to/3zgzFD5">Ring Light</a>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/29971830-e41b-11eb-9bfd-df9544fbfa61" alt="Exposure, ISO 426" data-uuid="99257739-9e87-3e8d-86e4-a15a2486746b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>There’s a definite sense that you’re meant to go all-in on Elgato’s streaming lineup, probably best evidenced by the lack of a microphone in the FaceCam. The company says it didn’t bother since most gamers tend to use headsets anyway, but let’s face it: Elgato would rather you pick up one of its <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wave:1" href="https://amzn.to/3e2F48h">Wave:1</a> or <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Wave:3" href="https://amzn.to/2TY1DnP">Wave:3</a> mics. They do indeed sound great, but they’re not my preferred microphones thanks to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elgato-wave-3-microphone-hands-on-150021908.html">some issues I had</a> with getting the Wave:3 to work while I was wearing a headset — yes, even one made by Elgato’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-27-corsair-acquires-elgato-gaming.html">parent company</a> Corsair.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/27fb4d10-e41c-11eb-977f-553e0db2d59c" alt="Elgato Camera Hub, hey look it&#39;s me" data-uuid="31f9cc9f-c1fe-3c22-8108-cef3ca0be96d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>For the most part, the FaceCam has a lot fewer kinks. My biggest problem was plugging it in, as it must be plugged into your system directly and not via a hub. And that’s tough with many modern laptops, which may only have two USB-C ports. The FaceCam comes with a USB-C to USB-A cord, and the company recommends you use the included wire instead of providing your own. I was forced to search around for a converter dongle. While I commend companies for finally embracing USB-C in their gaming accessories, we need some solutions on the software side to ensure that they can actually be used with hubs. My Logitech C920 works with a hub and it comes with a built-in mic, so it’s likely to remain my default webcam for most purposes.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/00665b10-e41b-11eb-82b7-111b8417758f" alt="Elgato FaceCam mounted on top of a monitor" data-uuid="f1265b1e-9f7f-34d9-8335-0edd662d58e9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Kris Naudus / Engadget</div></figure><p>Still, the FaceCam is off to a promising start. The video quality is crisp and free of noise, and when it’s not there’s a built-in filter you can enable. I haven’t needed it to, though, as the camera has handled my Google Hangouts and Zoom calls with ease. The price is a bit steep, but still on par with Logitech’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Brio 4K" href="https://amzn.to/3hum19f">Brio 4K</a> and Razer’s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Kiyo Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3hSHB6i">Kiyo Pro</a>, both of which cost $200.
