If you’re the type of person who’s prone to misplacing their belongings, accessory maker Spigen might have something that could help. As spotted by <a href="https://gizmodo.com/spigen-s-airpods-pro-case-straps-an-apple-airtag-tracke-1847570223"><em><ins>Gizmodo</ins></em></a>, the company has released the <a href="https://fave.co/3Bhz2d9"><ins>Tag Armor Duo</ins></a>, a $34.99 case that protects your AirPods Pro case while including a slot for an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-29-each-find-my-item-tracker-comning-april-30-171736127.html">AirTag</a>.</p><p>Spigen isn’t the first accessory maker to make something like this, but the company’s solution has a certain elegance to it. Not only is there a built-in slot for Apple’s lost item tracker, but it also comes with a handy carabiner on the side and a cutout on the bottom to leave the Lightning port unobstructed. You also don’t have to take the case off to charge your AirPods Pro wirelessly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At $64 for both the case and a single AirTag, Spigen’s Tag Armor Duo isn’t exactly a cheap option. It’s also worth pointing out <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ios-15-code-leak-airpods-apple-id-114508704.html"><ins>iOS 15</ins></a> will include a feature that will allow the AirPods Pro to connect to Apple’s Find My network over Bluetooth. Still, if you want the most peace of mind possible, you could do worse than the Tag Armor Duo. With an AirTag attached to your AirPods Pro case, you can use the U1 chip on a recent iPhone to find the case using an ultra-wideband connection. That allows you to take advantage of Apple’s Precision Finding feature to make locating it easier. The tag also includes a speaker so it can ring to let you know where it is.&nbsp;</p><p>You can buy the Tag Armor Duo from Spigen&#39;s website and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon" href="https://amzn.to/3BhSlDo">Amazon</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/spigen-tag-armor-duo-airpods-pro-case-153429195.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">30001400-c6ce-4016-baad-84e2b448cd73</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 15:34:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630078472</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T15:34:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab0eb3f0-0748-11ec-9fa6-2a7ff13685d4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ab0eb3f0-0748-11ec-9fa6-2a7ff13685d4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spigen]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Spigen Tag Armor Duo]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Spigen Tag Armor Duo]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Latest ‘Metroid Dread’ gameplay trailer shows off new moves and a new enemy]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-metroid-dread-release-date-163036346.html">surprise-announced <em>Metroid Dread</em></a><em>, </em>the fifth mainline game in the series, at E3 this year. Part of the surprise was that it was arriving this year, October 8th to be precise. Now, with just over a month before it arrives, Nintendo has released a new trailer for <em>Metroid Dread, </em>which might be our last look at the game before launch. Of course, this trailer isn&#39;t as detailed as the 20 minutes of gameplay Nintendo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-preview-e3-130020326.html">showed off at E3</a>, but it still shows off a lot of what to expect when <em>Metroid Dread</em> arrives on the Switch.&nbsp;</p><div id="8e7f577737664dfd966b5b7ab72ccb2e"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_XnbTayTH4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>The video mixes more cinematic shots of Samus Aran battling some pretty huge and intimidating baddies with the 2D gameplay footage that originally defined the series before the first-person <em>Metroid Prime</em> games. The game looks immediately familiar to people who&#39;ve been waiting for a new 2D Metroid game, but Samus Aran has more abilities to navigate the terrain and battle enemies than ever before. The trailer moves fast, but there&#39;s lots of aerial dashing, underwater action, multiple different arm cannon weapons, wall jumping and more.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Given that this is the first all-new, side-scrolling Metroid game since 2002&#39;s <em>Metroid Fusion </em>for the Game Boy Advance (!), <em>Dread</em> has a lot to live up to. But at least from what we&#39;ve seen so far, Nintendo may have pulled off the feat of bringing one of its oldest franchises into the modern era of gaming. We&#39;ll find out in just over a month.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-switch-gameplay-trailer-145519457.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">079b84ad-edd6-4c63-9111-7838f3ef9639</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 14:55:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630076123</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T14:55:37+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/032033f0-0746-11ec-b7de-d982f8e89fec" width="1750" height="1054" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/032033f0-0746-11ec-b7de-d982f8e89fec" width="1750" height="1054" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nintendo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Metroid Dread gameplay]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Metroid Dread]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tesla applies to become an energy supplier in Texas]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Tesla began building a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-battery-farm-angelton-texas-204329254.html">secretive 100-megawatt energy storage project</a> in Angleton, Texas, a town some 40 miles south of Houston, there were questions about what the company planned to do with the facility.

But lately I’ve wanted to change it up and do some writing that flexes different parts of my brain: things like short stories, essays or even a longer fiction piece.</p><p>But since I’m a tech nerd at heart, I couldn’t help but start thinking about new software or gadgets I could use to optimize my pursuit. I started using my favorite writing app, Bear, on the iPad Pro. I had read that minimizing distractions while writing can be crucial to making headway – and though my job means I’m almost always multitasking while writing, the luxury of my new hobby is that I can take the time to truly focus. But all those notifications and distracting apps lurk right beneath the surface, testing my resolve to actually sit down and get into the zone.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>At the same time, I caught wind of a new product from a company called Astrohaus, the “Hemingwrite,” a <a href="https://hemingwrite.com/">limited-edition version</a> of a device that Astrohaus <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-23-freewrite-smart-typewriter-launch.html">has sold for about five years</a>. <a href="https://getfreewrite.com/products/freewrite-smart-typewriter">The Freewrite</a> (and the Hemingwrite edition, which is already sold out) combines an excellent mechanical keyboard with an e-ink display and is meant purely for drafting text. There aren’t even arrow keys, so editing anything more than a few words back is a non-starter. It has WiFi, so you can sync your drafts to Dropbox, Google Drive or Evernote, but that’s about the only concession it makes to the internet age.</p><p>My colleague Kris Naudus tried the Freewrite Traveler last year. As the name implies, it’s a portable version of the Freewrite with a clamshell, laptop-like design and a standard laptop-style keyboard. She <a href="https://www.engadget.com/astrohaus-freewrite-traveler-eink-typewriter-review-130000032.html">did not love it</a>, mostly because of the refresh rate on the e-ink screen.</p><p>The Traveler held  little appeal to me, but the full-size Freewrite wormed its way into my mind. It’s expensive at $600, but it’s a beautiful machine with an aesthetic that spoke to me. I imagined starting my day with a large cup of coffee and the Freewrite, banging out my thoughts for an hour every morning before starting my work day. With my phone silenced, good music on my headphones and a blank page in front of me, I’d surely get into the writing flow.</p><div id="ce87b14a1c6841dfa200bce6c2f051f7"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wlLULToutEk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>By the beginning of August, I had decided to try the Freewrite for a month and see if it was a useful tool for me. My first impression of the Freewrite hardware was that it looked just as striking in person as it does online. The main chassis is a dark gray aluminum, while the underside is a bright white soft-touch plastic that matches the white keycaps. The e-ink screen is a little under five inches wide and a bit over two and a half inches tall. There’s also a smaller thin strip of a screen below that displays things like word count, a clock, a timer or the sync status of your drafts.</p><p>Flanking that screen are two pleasantly chunky physical switches: one for controlling WiFi settings and another to move between three different folders that drafts are saved in. The last button wakes up the Freewrite when you’re ready to go. Like the two switches, this button just feels great to press. At a time when so many of our devices try to do so many things, there’s something pleasant about a beautiful piece of hardware designed to do one thing well.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4a098c00-073a-11ec-bbf7-7b3868ac997f" alt="Astrohaus Freewrite" data-uuid="07d8c2a6-572c-3b08-a4db-c15fa69bbbb8"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>Right away, I noticed the learning curve. For me, it was a combination of the mechanical keyboard and e-ink screen. Those are both two of the main selling points for the device, and they’re each very different from what I’m used to. After years of using thin laptop keyboards, the mechanical keyboard tripped me up a bit; my accuracy and speed were not the finest. Given the lack of a cursor and arrow keys, I tried to train myself to blast past small typos rather than delete words to go back and fix them.</p><p>This is just what the Freewrite’s creators intended. This isn’t a device for editing your thoughts, just for getting them out as quickly and efficiently as possible. Fine-tuning can happen later, on a laptop. It took some time to get used to this approach, and I still often find myself stopping to go back and fix small mistakes, but I can definitely appreciate the benefit of moving forward with whatever I’m writing rather than getting hung up on the details.</p><p>The e-ink screen presents its own challenges and benefits. I was originally worried about its size, but that turned out not to be an issue. You can adjust the text size, but the default setting let me see plenty of my draft. I’d occasionally have to page up a bit to refresh my memory on what I was working on, but it honestly never felt too cramped.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c109b820-073a-11ec-b5f6-27581732db28" alt="Astrohaus Freewrite" data-uuid="cfcd262b-86f9-33c8-a00e-4de88b49eda9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Nathan Ingraham / Engadget</div></figure><p>It’s sharp, clear and looks great with or without the light activated. I tried to train myself to write by natural light, and most of the time I found the built-in front-light (again similar to the Kindle) unnecessary. It’s still good to have you prefer working in darker conditions, but I try to do most of my work in a well-lit room.</p><p>If you’ve ever used a Kindle, you know the big downside of e-ink screens: the refresh rate. It’s not as big an issue on a Kindle, where you flip the page every 30 seconds or so, but on a typing device the screen is updating constantly. It’s far different than the instant feedback you get when typing on a traditional computer, and I can absolutely see how it would be off-putting to some people.</p><p>It’s worth taking the time to get used to, though. Most experienced typists probably don’t need to watch every single character appear; I just tried to type and get into a flow and only really pay attention to the screen when I wanted to go back and read something. In my mind, I think the trade-off between a traditional LCD screen here is worth it. We have more than enough blue-light screens in our lives.</p><p>Another benefit of the e-ink display is that it means the battery life is measured in weeks, not hours (yup, like the Kindle). I’ve been using the Freewrite pretty heavily over the last month and I think I’ve given it a full charge twice. Astrohaus says it’s rated to run for four weeks with 30 minutes of daily usage. My sessions were usually longer but less frequent; I definitely didn’t hit four weeks between charges, though. Regardless, unless you use the device for multiple hours every day, you shouldn’t have to worry about running out of juice.</p><p>Overall, I’d say the hardware delivers what Astrohaus promises. But I’m not trying to review this like an iPad or other modern gadgets. For me, the question has been whether this thing will help me become a more disciplined writer, and if it is better suited to that task than other tools at my disposal.</p><div id="aaf3cce57aff4349838eb4cfc5dce3e1"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Trying something a little different lately.

Aside from this story and one other, everything else I’ve created on the Freewrite has been words I would not have written if I wasn’t trying to write creatively.</p><p>Of course, that’s not to say I couldn’t have done the same thing with my iPad, a laptop, or various other gadgets. From that perspective, it’s hard to spend $600 on a Freewrite, as it doesn’t offer any truly new features compared to a laptop.</p><p>But, in the same way that a Kindle, Nintendo Switch or a high-end digital camera are better for specific purposes than a smartphone or iPad, the Freewrite is optimized for its singular purpose better than other options. Because the hardware is so gorgeous and easy to use, I found myself wanting to pull it out – it has been a positive reinforcement tool that has helped me build my habit.</p><p>That said, I still have to have the discipline to use it and block out potential distractions. If I set up with a laptop on my desk while trying to write with the Freewrite, I’m just screwing myself.</p><p>That’s why the Freewrite hasn’t been an essential tool for my work. Even on days when I need to get writing done, I’m often multitasking, keeping an eye on our Slack channel and the news in a broader sense. I realize this doesn’t make for an optimal writing environment, but it’s the reality of being an online journalist.</p><p>Practically speaking, I’m often flipping between my writing and a browser for research or another document with notes on my piece. There simply aren&#39;t a lot of stories that I work where I can just sit down and write uninterrupted. This story is one of them, though, and a workflow where I do my drafting on the Freewrite while also having my iPad handy for research, notes and an occasional Slack check has worked pretty well thus far.</p><p>There’s no way to quantify how much of this is due to the Freewrite and how much of it is simply me finding the willpower to start developing a new habit. People are creatures of habit, and I, too, enjoy a good ritual. I haven’t fully transformed my life where I can write uninterrupted every morning like I imagined, but I have found myself making more time for my new hobby. The other night, I had a few hours free after work, and instead of blowing them on video games, I worked on a story I’ve been writing – a small victory over my lowest impulses, but I still think it counts.</p><p>Lately, I find myself waking up thinking about when I can squeeze in 30 minutes or an hour of writing time without the distractions of news and work, and the Freewrite is my first choice for that. It’s a joy to type on, and it’s a prime example of hardware that just gets out of your way and lets you focus on the task at hand. There’s no doubt that it’s an expensive device, and one that is more limited than a comparably priced laptop. It’s a luxury, but for a specific type of person, it might also end up being an invaluable tool for your work. For me, it&#39;s been a great help in fostering a new hobby. It&#39;s not an essential tool, but it&#39;s something that makes me want to write more when I&#39;m not, and something that makes me want to keep writing when I am using it.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/astrohaus-freewrite-one-month-writing-test-140008132.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d9ee2bdb-d55b-4207-8b98-b192c073be7c</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 14:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630073454</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T14:11:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" width="2000" height="1234" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6a8dc4e0-0740-11ec-bed7-09a47f112b8e" width="2000" height="1234" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nathan Ingraham / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Freewrite standalone word processor with keyboard sits on an office desktop.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Freewrite]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's MacBook Air M1 drops back down to $850 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We rarely see the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3DnXCLq">MacBook Air M1</a> drop below $900, but that&#39;s the case today on Amazon. Apple&#39;s thin-and-light laptop is on sale for $850 right now, or $150 off its normal price. The base model has been hovering at $900 on Amazon for the past few months, likely to stay competitive with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-student-discounts-140038070.html">Apple&#39;s education pricing</a> during the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/back-to-school-gift-guide-2021/">back-to-school</a> season, but this is the first time since a brief moment at the end of July that we&#39;ve seen the Air M1 this low. At the time of writing this, only the gold model is in stock — both silver and space gray have sold out.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3DnXCLq" id="f4ec40e804504237ab07f209c011ac06" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy MacBook Air M1 at Amazon - $850</a><p>This is far and away the best Apple laptop for most people thanks to its slender body, lack of fan noise and killer performance. We gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">score of 94</a> in part for those attributes, plus we also like its lovely Retina display, comfortable keyboard and trackpad and excellent 16-hour battery life.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The star of the show here is Apple&#39;s M1 chipset, which makes the Air run incredibly fast. The notebook wakes almost instantly when you open the lid, native apps run super smoothly and the machine as a whole is impressively responsive. You&#39;re also able to run iOS apps with the M1 chip, which is a fun feature to have. Graphics performance is noteworthy, too: MacBook Airs have not been gaming machines in the past, and we probably still wouldn&#39;t use it to run intense titles, but it performed well while playing Apple Arcade games and even <em>Fortnite</em>. And since the laptop doesn&#39;t have a fan inside, it&#39;ll be much quieter than most previous Apple laptops you may have had.</p><p>Our biggest complaints about the MacBook Air M1 are its paltry 720p webcam and its limit of two USB-C ports. While living the dongle life can get frustrating, it&#39;s a small price to pay for an otherwise stellar laptop that can handle most things you&#39;ll through at it.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-sale-150-off-amazon-131724416.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d17084bb-0130-4860-8445-f6ac1e48db57</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 13:17:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630070274</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T13:17:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple MacBook Air M1]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Keychron's Q1 keyboard is its most customizable yet]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The humble computer keyboard might feel utilitarian, but given it’s the part of your setup you interact with the most, it’s kinda wild that we don&#39;t often give it thought. Fortunately, there’s a vibrant scene of small (and not so small) companies that understand everyone’s needs are different and that getting the right size, shape and ergonomic layout can upgrade your working or gaming life in significant ways. Keychron is one such company.</p><p>Keychron has earned a reputation for making affordable yet feature-rich <a href="https://www.engadget.com/favorite-gadgets-2020-irl-170055096.html">mechanical keyboards</a>, and <a href="https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-q1">the Q1</a> (starting at $169) is the latest member of the family. The Q is a nod to <a href="https://qmk.fm/">QMK</a>, a popular open-source firmware that lets you customize compatible keyboards to your liking. It’s Keychron’s most ambitious deck yet, and a direct competitor to something like the <a href="https://www.pcgamingrace.com/products/glorious-gmmk-pro-75-barebone-black">GMMK Pro</a> or the <a href="https://kbdfans.com/collections/bella/products/bella?variant=34248579121291">KBDFans Bella</a>, both of which cost north of $250 depending on your preferred configuration.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Q1 is a 75-percent keyboard, which means there’s no number pad and the home cluster and arrow keys are placed a little more tightly compared to a tenkeyless deck (that gives those keys a little more space of their own). The Q1 is Mac- and Windows compatible and comes with an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Connector-USB-Mini-Mechanical-Keyboards/dp/B087PMN84K/ref=pd_sbs_1/133-9064674-5838700?pd_rd_w=8r8OV&amp;pf_rd_p=3676f086-9496-4fd7-8490-77cf7f43f846&amp;pf_rd_r=12SZFYEKC6CPH8H1W0K5&amp;pd_rd_r=5b785581-4f8c-4ec1-937d-fc4cf27136fd&amp;pd_rd_wg=JHWQ1&amp;pd_rd_i=B087PMN84K&amp;psc=1">Aviator style USB-C</a> cable so that people know you really mean business. Alas, there’s no Bluetooth option here if that’s something you wanted.</p><p>As customization is the key here (no pun intended), it’s no surprise that the switches are hot-swappable. Keychron already offers a decent <a href="https://www.keychron.com/collections/keychron-keycap-collection-1">range of keycaps</a>, though you can of course grab your own if you have a preferred set already. If you already own switches you like, you can order the barebone deck and save $20. You can also choose from three aluminum case colors: black, navy and space gray. Both ANSI and ISO layouts are available depending on your preference (or, more likely, location).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6c08f540-0666-11ec-b97e-9411ce8b9690" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="3a5db443-b6f8-3573-9633-afa91ede38c2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>One thing I love about all Keychron keyboards is that they not only come with a keycap puller tool and a switch remover tool (where applicable), but you’ll also get the keycaps for both Windows and MacOS layouts. This makes it easy for the company just to stock one SKU and possibly helps keep costs down. If, like me, you use both operating systems — you can then repurpose any of their keyboards without having to buy new caps later. Or worse, live with a CMD key when you want a Windows key or vice versa.</p><p>A fancy keyboard isn’t anything without RGB lighting, of course, and naturally, that’s included here too. Keychron opted for a more subtle “south-facing” integration, which pretty much means what you think: The lights are only visible from below. I don’t need or use RGB, so I tend to turn it off. The implementation here is subtle yet bright enough to still remain useful if it’s something you want.</p><p>For the more hardcore enthusiast, inside there’s a gasket-based design with a noise-reducing foam deck between that and the PCB. For those who really like to get into details, know that the stabilizers here are screw-in (rather than plate), which usually means the larger keys are steadier. There’s also the option for a customized metal “badge” where the Insert key would be. If you send Keychron a design, it’ll etch it onto that badge for you to make it truly personalized. There will also be an option to add a rotary dial here (much like on the GMMK Pro), or you can just switch it back to the Insert key if none of that tickles your fancy.</p><p>For all its changeable parts, arguably the most useful way to customize the Q1 is with the <a href="https://caniusevia.com/">Via app</a>, or with the aforementioned QMK. (Via is basically a graphical interface for the latter.) With Via you can reassign any key to pretty much anything else as well as design and assign macros to the function layer (i.e., press Fn and a target key to trigger more complex key combinations). More on this later.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cfd81b00-0666-11ec-b5f7-4c05c07fad59" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="28ee6b48-f727-36a1-8350-c3beac9f48ae"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>With all this talk about gaskets and stabilizers, it might seem that the Q1 is designed for advanced users. And it certainly will appeal to those with specific requirements. But Keychron’s popularity, in my opinion, is born out of making the geeky and exotic accessible to the normies out there. The Q1, then, is perhaps marketed toward those who have dabbled with mechanical keyboards and want to dip a toe into deeper waters, while still offering enough for the avid keyboard tinkerers.</p><p>That said, the first thing you’ll want to do with the Q1 when you take it out of the box is… put it down. At 3.5 pounds (1.6kg) it’s definitely on the chunky side. For context, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Keychron-Bluetooth-Mechanical-Keyboard-Wireless-Keyboard/dp/B07QBPCGY2/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=keychron+k2&amp;qid=1629893215&amp;sr=8-3">Keychron’s K2</a> wireless keyboard has a  similar footprint but is a svelte 1.5 pounds (663g) — less than half the weight. The Q1 isn’t really designed for portability, though, so that extra heft just glues it to your desk and makes you feel more confident that this isn’t going to rattle itself apart as you bash out fanfic/code/school essays on it. The weight is also pretty standard for this category.</p><p>The model I was able to test came pre-installed with Gateron brown switches. Before then I had been using Gateron reds but I’m an instant convert. Of course, the very point of the Q1 is that you can put in whatever switches you like. Keychron also included a set of blue switches, which I used to test out how easy it was to swap ‘em out. Not only was that process pretty easy (once you get used to the very firm pull required to get them out), but I found myself fond enough of the blues for certain keys that I left them in. They’re generally a little too loud for my taste to have across the board, but being able to mix things up that way is the very spirit of customizable keyboards like these.</p><p>On that theme of noise… for me that was one of the bigger turn-offs for mechanical keyboards. Until I experimented myself, my main exposure to them was hearing someone across the office frantically clacking their way through an email. This is why I gravitated toward red switches at first. On the Q1, though, even something clicky like a blue switch isn’t too audible thanks to the gasket design and the foam insert on the Q1. Even the noisier switch flavors won’t alert your neighbors to your frantic typing during the small hours. If, like my former officemate, you are unencumbered by such worries, know that the same design makes for a keyboard with comfortable flex, giving it a much smoother action than plate-based designs.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/85c39120-0666-11ec-bfd7-6d15c7bb7329" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="7d5d0010-f16e-3e96-8c62-3e03ec6b6dca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>As alluded to earlier, though, perhaps one of the more exciting features here for those looking to take their keyboard customization to the next level is the support for VIA/QMK firmware noodling. If you get tired of doing the same convoluted keyboard shortcuts for regular tasks (like Windows’ Ctrl+Win+Arrow combo to switch between desktops), this is for you.</p><p>I already mentioned you can pretty much map any key to another. So if you wanted to swap Z and X around… you could. More usefully, you can also change which keys control media etcetera. Out of the box, the Q1 uses the standard “Fn+F10” combo to mute audio. My stubby fingers found this a little unnatural, so I used Via to remap it to Fn+Left Arrow. Much more manageable for my typing style.</p><p>Taking things a bit further, you can also enter much more complicated key combinations with macros. An explanation of this is beyond the scope of this article, but as an example, I was able to set up a simple key combo to launch one of my favorite chat apps. This was more of an experiment for someone who hasn’t done anything remotely like programming in a number of years. You’ll need to do some reading up to figure out how to tell a macro what to do, but once you have (and it’s really not that hard), you’ll find yourself thinking of evermore clever ideas.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fec336c0-0666-11ec-8efa-fa48fb8d4993" alt="Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard." data-uuid="9ebde6c5-c863-37d7-98b9-1508def46dba"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">James Trew / Engadget</div></figure><p>Some keyboards, like the GMMK Pro, offer their own software for customization. You can generally expect these apps to be a little more tightly integrated with the makers’ products, but VIA is easy enough to use that you can get most things done without much hassle.</p><p>Support for VIA/QMK is far from unique to the Q1: The GMMK Pro and KDBFans Bella both offer it too, along with many other customizable keyboards. But considering the price of the Q1, it rounds out an impressive spec sheet making it both a very accessible yet technically capable choice.</p><p>Some potential buyers might lament the lack of wireless connectivity, or the fact you can’t adjust its height (it measures just shy of two inches/45mm at the back). But both of these things are fairly standard for barebones and customizable keyboards. The fact that you can configure pretty much anything else to your liking makes this a great entry into the world of barebones keyboards at a price that’s very competitive.</p><p>The Q1 is available now directly from Keychron starting at $169. The rotary dial add-on will come in the following weeks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/keychron-q-1-fully-customizable-keyboard-130015959.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b0f96be6-d9a9-4bee-a9f7-c4fcb0d234c2</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 13:00:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630076618</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T15:03:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/196541e0-0666-11ec-be5e-e314ca333cd9" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/196541e0-0666-11ec-be5e-e314ca333cd9" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[James Trew / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Keychron Q1 customizable keyboard]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Razer's Blade 15 Advanced is $900 off in Amazon's one-day sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is ushering in the weekend with a one-day-only sale on a bunch of Razer laptops and gaming accessories.

The tech giant has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-microsoft-warns-thousands-cloud-customers-exposed-databases-emails-2021-08-26/">warned</a> its clients of the flaw in its flagship database service Cosmos DB after it was discovered and reported by security company Wiz. In the <a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/chaosdb-how-we-hacked-thousands-of-azure-customers-databases">blog post</a> Wiz has published, it said it was able to use the vulnerability, which it has named &quot;ChaosDB,&quot; to gain &quot;complete unrestricted access to the accounts and databases&quot; of thousands of Azure clients.</p><p>Azure customers, including Fortune 500 companies such as Coca-Cola and Exxon-Mobil, use Cosmos DB to manage the massive amounts of data they get in real time. The company explained that it found a series of flaws in the Cosmos DB feature called Jupyter Notebook that gives customers a way to visualize their data. That feature has been around since 2019, but it was switched on for all Cosmos DB customers just this past February. Wiz said that a series of misconfigurations in the notebook created a loophole, which allows any user &quot;to download, delete or manipulate a massive collection of commercial databases, as well as read/write access to the underlying architecture of Cosmos DB.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While the security company praised Microsoft for disabling the notebook within 48 hours after it was alerted about the issue and for notifying around 30 percent of its customers, it warned that more clients may be at risk. Microsoft only notified the customers that were affected during Wiz&#39;s week-long research period this early August. However, the security firm believes the vulnerability has been exploitable for months, possibly even years. It&#39;s now advising Azure customers to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/secure-access-to-data?tabs=using-primary-key#primary-keys">rotate and regenerate</a> their access keys even if they didn&#39;t get an email from Microsoft. That said, the tech giant said it found no evidence that the flaw has been exploited. It told the customers it emailed that there&#39;s no &quot;indication that external entities outside the researcher (Wiz) had access to the primary read-write key</p><p>As <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-microsoft-warns-thousands-cloud-customers-exposed-databases-emails-2021-08-26/"><em>Reuters</em></a> notes, this is the latest in a series of bad security news for Microsoft over the past year. In February, the tech giant has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/solarwinds-hackers-microsoft-source-code-3-products-063418253.html">revealed</a> that the SolarWinds hackers accessed and downloaded source code for Azure, its cloud-based management solution Intune and its mail and calendar server Exchange. The Chinese Hafnium hacking group also exploited a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-releases-a-one-click-patch-for-its-critical-exchange-vulnerability-090242055.html">vulnerability in Exchange</a> to infiltrate at least 30,000 organizations around the world, including police departments, hospitals and banks.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-azure-flaw-cloud-customers-data-vulnerable-114027306.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d8286e34-3cb5-4ee0-8920-afa959f2faa9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 11:40:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630062122</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T11:02:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/46b840c0-a798-11eb-bfad-ddeeded166e8" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/46b840c0-a798-11eb-bfad-ddeeded166e8" width="6000" height="3375" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HJBC via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ISSY LES MOULINEAUX, FRANCE - OCTOBER 9, 2020: French headquarters of Microsoft, American multinational company which develops, manufactures, licenses and sells computer software and electronics]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[French headquarters of Microsoft, Issy-les-Moulineaux, France]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Explaining Apple’s $100 million App Store settlement]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following the class-action lawsuit between Apple and app developers, the company has agreed to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-change-app-store-rules-class-action-lawsuit-010727976.html">change several App Store rules</a>, including allowing developers to email users “about payment methods outside of their iOS app” — think Netflix and Spotify offering subscription setups through the internet browser, all without Apple taking a cut.

The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-27-logitech-streamlabs.html">Logitech-owned</a> company has launched a monthly tipping service called <a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-unveils-new-way-for-viewers-to-subscribe-to-live-streamers">Streamlabs Creator Subscription</a>, which (as you can probably guess from its name) gives streamers a way to set up a subscription service for viewers. Streamlabs says creators will get 100 percent of the tips fans give them after PayPal takes its usual processing fees.&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643160/streamlabs-monthly-tipping-subscription-twitch-zero-fees"><em>The Verge</em></a> notes, that makes Streamlabs Creator Subscription a more appealing option than Twitch&#39;s built-in service, which takes a 50 percent cut from the subscription fees streamers get. Especially since Streamlabs&#39; new tipping tool can be directly integrated into its popular OBS software suite anyway. The OBS software can be used to stream not just on Twitch, but also on YouTube, Facebook and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tiktok-streamlabs-live-streaming-integration-165006138.html">TikTok</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Streamlabs will let creators decide on what kind of subscription service they want to offer their fans, and they can also set specific price points. If they choose, however, they can allow viewers to choose how much to contribute every month. Fans will get &quot;redeemable alerts&quot; in exchange for their contributions, and they can use those if they want their favorite streamer to thank them on screen. Streamlabs will also be adding leaderboards and badges in the coming weeks to encourage fans to support their favorite creators.</p><p>Ashray Urs, Head of Product at Streamlabs, said in a statement:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&quot;As the live streaming industry has grown, so has the need for a sustainable revenue model. Currently, most major streaming platforms provide viewers with a way to subscribe to a channel; however, they usually split the revenue from the subscription in half between the creators and platform. In addition, platforms require a creator to meet certain qualifications before they can unlock the ability for viewers to subscribe. Streamlabs Creator Subscription is open for anyone with a Streamlabs tip page, regardless of size or how often they stream.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/streamlabs-creator-subscription-095053962.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49cddcfc-c663-4967-97ee-b4bdedf305b0</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 09:50:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630055685</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T09:14:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Employment & Career]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cdfb0740-070e-11ec-b5e2-71b80c067d2c" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cdfb0740-070e-11ec-b5e2-71b80c067d2c" width="6048" height="4024" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[fpphotobank via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cute young asian girl enthusiastically plays on her smartphone in a computer club, while her friends play online games with each other.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cute young asian girl enthusiastically plays on her smartphone in a computer club, while her friends play online games with each other]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Puma is releasing official 'Animal Crossing' sneakers and clothing]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nintendo&#39;s colorful, character-filled island life sim <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>lends itself to merchandise collabs.

Apple says it will release an “annual transparency report” that will “share meaningful statistics about the app review process, including the number of apps rejected for different reasons, the number of customer and developer accounts deactivated, objective data regarding search queries and results, and the number of apps removed from the App Store.”</p><p>There are other changes that are meant to give developers more flexibility in setting their prices. Apple says it will increase the number of price points available to app makers from “fewer than 100 to more than 500.” Those changes are expected by the end of next year, according to <a href="https://www.hbsslaw.com/press/apple-ios-app-developers/us-ios-developers-to-benefit-from-100-million-apple-small-developer-assistance-fund-and-changes-to-app-store-policies-in-developer-antitrust-class-action-settlement">a statement</a> from attorneys representing the developers. Additionally, Apple agreed as part of the settlement to keep in place the changes it originally said were in response to COVID-19 that reduced commissions to 15 percent for developers making less than $1 million a year. That change will now be in effect for “at least the next three years.”</p><p>The changes are in response to a class action lawsuit that dates back to 2019. Developers making less than $1 million may also be able to receive payments as part of the settlement, though <a href="http://www.smallappdeveloperassistance.com/"><ins>the website</ins></a> with details on the arrangements hasn’t yet been published.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-change-app-store-rules-class-action-lawsuit-010727976.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">11597e9d-a170-45c5-8431-6c2f621e1e10</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 27 Aug 2021 01:07:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630027985</ingested><modified>2021-08-27T01:33:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/d70cfaa0-e7cf-11ea-aeff-64fdfeebef06" width="5079" height="3386" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-08/d70cfaa0-e7cf-11ea-aeff-64fdfeebef06" width="5079" height="3386" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Lam / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A group of young developers stand for a group photo on stage during the Apple World Wide Developers Conference in San Francisco, California, U.S., June 13, 2016.

Starting today, you can buy the machine, without any additional extras like cycling shoes, for $1,495. That’s nearly a 20 percent discount from the $1,895 price the company has sold the bike for since September of last year. Peloton is also dropping prices in Australia, Canada, Germany and the UK. At the same time, it&#39;s reducing how much it costs to finance the machine in the US by $10 to $39 per month.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, what isn’t changing with today’s announcement is the cost of the company’s Pelton Membership, which will still set you back $39 per month. You need that subscription to get the most out of the bike.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The announcement comes on the same day the company announced a Q4 <a href="https://investor.onepeloton.com/static-files/4836b73e-6e63-4517-a3cd-86c45ea98e68"><ins>net loss of $313.2 million</ins></a>.

Clearly, Peloton hopes a price cut can help it recapture some of the growth it experienced previously, and entice new customers to its subscription offerings.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/peloton-bike-price-cut-230347867.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4d159954-15a4-4915-abb4-6ec9116ce5dd</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 23:03:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630015260</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T22:01:12+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a1529080-06b6-11ec-bedd-6a95d843b171" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a1529080-06b6-11ec-bedd-6a95d843b171" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Peloton]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Peloton Bike]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Peloton Bike]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[T-Mobile hacker says the carrier's security is 'awful']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-data-breach-affected-people-103104868.html">T-Mobile customer data breach</a> might not have been a sophisticated data breach — in fact, it might have been relatively trivial. The hacker claiming to be responsible for the attack, John Binns, told the <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-mobile-hacker-who-stole-data-on-50-million-customers-their-security-is-awful-11629985105?mod=latest_headlines">discussion</a> that T-Mobile&#39;s security was &quot;awful.&quot; Binns reportedly broke through by using a readily available tool to find an exposed router, and took a week to delve through customer data stored in a data center near East Wenatchee, Washington.</p><p>Binns, who provided apparent evidence to back up his claims of involvement, said he breached T-Mobile and stole the data to create &quot;noise&quot; that drew attention to him. He came forward to highlight his claims he had been kidnapped in Germany and placed into a fake mental hospital. There wasn&#39;t any evidence to support that allegation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>T-Mobile declined to comment on Binns&#39; claims in response to the <em>Journal</em>. It previously stated that it was &quot;confident&quot; it had closed the security holes used in the breach, which compromised sensitive info for more than 54 million active and former customers.</p><p>The incident is the third breach in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-data-breach-security-phone-number-hack-2020-172117333.html">two years</a>, and suggests that T-Mobile is still struggling to offer security that matches its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-01-t-mobile-completes-sprint-merger.html">rapidly growing</a> customer base. It only hired a new security leader earlier in 2021, for instance. If Binns&#39; claims are accurate, though, the ease of the attack is also frightening — it only took a casual hack to put tens of millions of people at risk of fraud and other data crimes. The company may need to scramble if it&#39;s going to reassure customers that breaches will be rare going forward.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-hacker-says-carrier-security-weak-212819523.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b727ad46-4698-433d-9f52-c15dd7c309b6</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 21:28:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630013302</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T21:28:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/00a273e0-01ce-11ec-93bb-3f4f8012b9e4" width="5324" height="3549" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/00a273e0-01ce-11ec-93bb-3f4f8012b9e4" width="5324" height="3549" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ARLINGTON, VA - AUGUST 18:  People walk past the front of a T-Mobile retail store on August 18, 2021 in Arlington, Virginia.

What it won’t do is ban communities that “challenge the consensus views on the pandemic.”</p><p>“Dissent is a part of Reddit and the foundation of democracy. Reddit is a place for open and authentic discussion and debate,” Huffman said in a thread that is locked, preventing Reddit users from replying to him directly. “This includes conversations that question or disagree with popular consensus.

This includes protests that criticize or object to our decisions on which communities to ban from the platform.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Huffman’s statement doesn’t reference a specific community or incident, but as <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgx3gw/reddit-responds-to-calls-from-moderators-to-fight-disinformation"><em>Vice</em> points out</a>, what likely prompted him to say anything at all was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vaxxhappened/comments/pbe8nj/we_call_upon_reddit_to_take_action_against_the/">thread from r/vaxxhappened</a>, a subreddit where people share memes about anti-vaxxers. “We call upon Reddit to take action against the rampant Coronavirus misinformation on their website,” says the title of the post, which accuses Reddit of doing &quot;nothing of substance&quot; to tackle the problem of misinformation on the platform. As of the writing of this article, it has nearly 170,000 upvotes, with various other communities crossposting the thread to their subreddits.</p><p>“We could have been better off months ago, but disinformation and lies have been allowed to spread readily through inaction and malice, and have dragged this on at the cost of lives,” the post says. “There can be no room for leniency when people are dying as a result of misinformation on this platform. Reddit as a global platform needs to take responsibility here.”</p><p>While Reddit often isn’t mentioned in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">same breath as Facebook and Twitter</a>, the platform is a source of misinformation.

The updates include more prominent placement of the “scan” feature — now located directly under the camera’s shutter button — and new capabilities that will suggest lenses and music based on your surroundings.</p><p>Snap has been experimenting with visual search, called “scan” since 2019. The feature allows Snapchat users to identify plants and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-13-theres-shazam-in-my-snapchat.html"><ins>music</ins></a>, solve math problems, and scan <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-scan-food-and-wine-labels-130019011.html"><ins>food and wine</ins></a> labels with the in-app camera. But up until now, much of this functionality was easily overlooked as it required a few extra taps to access. With the update now rolling out, “scan” visible whenever the camera is open.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Snapchat’s also adding a few new features it previewed earlier this year, like the ability to <a href="https://newsroom.snap.com/new-ar-tools-and-camera-experiences-for-snapchatters-creators-and-businesses"><ins>shop for outfits </ins></a>by pointing the camera at articles of clothing. It’s also adding Camera Shortcuts, which will suggest a combination of augmented reality lenses and music based on your surroundings. For example, pointing the camera at your pet may suggest AR lenses meant to work with dogs and music to go with your clip.</p><p>Though Snap has been working on its “scan” capabilities for some time, the fact that it’s now making the feature much more prominent underscores how big a priority it is for the company. Snap has also integrated scanning abilities into its latest <a href="https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-spectacles-augmented-reality-180101040.html"><ins>AR Spectacles,</ins></a> which can similarly suggest lenses based on what’s around you (unlike previous versions of Spectacles, the newest ones aren’t for sale just yet). Visual search also help Snap compete for creative talent with rivals like TikTok and Instagram (which also happens to be working on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-visual-search-instagram-shopping-190323553.html"><ins>its own</ins></a> visual search feature). The company told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642017/snapchat-scan-feature-ar-camera-visual-search?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"><em><ins>The Verge</ins></em></a> that it’s working on adding camera shortcuts to Spotlight to make it easier for people to riff on other users’ clips.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/snapchat-scan-features-visual-search-192454428.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">93138589-a9e4-4335-a47d-6b6db99eb8fe</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 19:24:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630005895</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T19:25:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6bd543d0-06a2-11ec-8bea-7e715e4b2511" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6bd543d0-06a2-11ec-8bea-7e715e4b2511" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Snap]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Snapchat is adding new "Camera Shortcuts" to scan.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[snapchat scan]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[YouTube will finally roll out picture-in-picture mode to all iOS users]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>YouTube is making good on its promise to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/youtube-app-ios-picture-in-picture-190533676.html">bring picture-in-picture viewing to iOS users</a>. <em>TechCrunch</em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/26/youtube-to-roll-out-picture-in-picture-viewing-for-all-u-s-ios-users-starting-with-premium-subscribers/">reports</a> that YouTube is promising PiP viewing to all iPhone and iPad users in the US, starting with volunteers using Premium.
