Now, for the first time, scientists have <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2021/07/XMM-Newton_sees_light_echo_from_behind_a_black_hole">seen</a> the phenomena that takes place behind them. As part of the breakthrough, researchers witnessed and captured the light from the back of a supermassive black hole 800 million light years away.&nbsp;</p><p>The latest breakthrough is a &quot;key part of the puzzle to understanding&quot; how the universe came to be, according to Stanford astrophysicist Dan Wilkins. What&#39;s more, it appears to confirm Einstein&#39;s theory of relativity from over a century ago.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While studying the bright flares of x-rays emanating from the black hole, a feature known as the corona, researchers also witnessed fainter flashes of light. These were the &quot;luminous echoes&quot; of of the flares bouncing off the gas behind the black hole. This phenomena was first predicted by Einstein in his theory of relativity published in 1916.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/6705a7d0-f371-11eb-97cf-a4858d090687" style="height:2250;width:4000;" alt="Black hole" data-uuid="56e7ca65-e3b7-3c2c-ae16-4481fde939f6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">ESA</div></figure><p>“Any light that goes into that black hole doesn’t come out, so we shouldn’t be able to see anything that’s behind the black hole,&quot; Wilkins explained. “The reason we can see that is because that black hole is warping space, bending light and twisting magnetic fields around itself.”</p><p>The supermassive black hole is 10 million times as massive as our Sun and located in the centre of a nearby spiral galaxy called I Zwicky 1. An international group of scientists witnessed the echoes using the European Space Agency&#39;s XMM-Newton and NASA’s NuSTAR space telescopes.

Square, led by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, has already purchased a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-buys-control-of-tidal-142318706.html">majority stake in Tidal</a> and launched a new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-bitcoin-hardware-wallet-173032873.html">Bitcoin business</a> in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>In a press release, Square called Afterpay &quot;the pioneering global &#39;buy now, pay later&#39; (BNPL) platform.&quot; Afterpay notes that it has over 16 million customers worldwide and services nearly 100,000 resellers across retail markets like &quot;fashion, homewares, beauty, sporting goods and more.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;The addition of Afterpay to Cash App will strengthen our growing networks of consumers around the world, while supporting consumers with flexible, responsible payment options,&quot; said Square&#39;s Brian Grassadonia. &quot;Afterpay will help deepen and reinforce the connections between our Cash App and Seller ecosystems, and accelerate our ability to offer a rich suite of commerce capabilities to Cash App customers.&quot;</p><p>Afterpay, like other increasingly popular BNPL services (including Affirm, Klarna and Uplift), allows customers to pay over time without interest. To make money, they charge retailers a fee (4 to 6 percent), promising to connect them with a desirable demographic and assume all financial risk. In Square&#39;s press release, Afterpay also said it can help &quot;drive repeat purchases [and] increase average transaction sizes.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>One of the world&#39;s largest retailers, Apple, is reportedly <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-pay-later-report-205333095.html">planning to offer</a> its own buy now, pay later type program directly to consumers. Much like PayPal&#39;s <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/for-you/pay-in-4">&quot;Pay in 4</a>&quot; service, &quot;Apple Pay in 4&quot; would allow Apple Wallet users to stretch purchases out to four payments, interest-free.

Prices in the category can range from $80 to $800 for extras including app-based controls, compatibility with smart assistants like Alexa, access to more data and customization. As part of its first stab at a smart air purifier, IKEA is looking to break into the market by sticking to its hallmarks: Affordability and minimalism.&nbsp;</p><p>The swedish flatpack giant is releasing two &quot;Starkvind&quot; devices, a floor-standalone air purifier and a side table model, which cost $129 and $189, respectively. Though, you&#39;ll need to pay for a separate $35 smart home hub to access the app-based controls.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/3b45f1d0-ef94-11eb-bff6-be6e9a568d22" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="IKEA" data-uuid="ad56c58c-1fa7-3f5e-9dd1-5c1b2db5050e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure><p>At that price range, you won&#39;t get the bells and whistles available on higher-end smart and regular models from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mila-smart-air-purifier-hands-on-pricing-availability-140040456.html">Mila</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-10-01-dyson-pure-cryptomic-air-purifier-hot-cool-formaldehyde.html">Dyson</a>. Both IKEA purifiers are identical inside: They contain a three-filter system designed to capture bigger particles like hair and dust; 99.5 percent of smaller airborne particles that measure less than 2.5 micrometers (or one 400th of a millimetre) and dust and pollen; and pollutants like formaldehyde and even bad odors.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/11603c90-ef94-11eb-beff-ad88b5a0ca35" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="IKEA air purifier" data-uuid="21c79b6a-2c32-3f57-9b5b-95f27372b5db"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">IKEA</div></figure><p>The Starkvind also has five different fan speeds that can be used on their own or controlled and scheduled from the IKEA Home app in conjunction with its TRÅDFRI smart home hub. The latter is a puck-shaped device that acts as the bridge between your IKEA smart products (like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ikea-fyrtur-smart-blinds-available-online-085812927.html">blinds</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-08-10-ikea-tradfri-apple-homekit-integration.html">light bulbs</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-25-ikea-symfonisk-review.html">speakers</a>) and your phone. While an auto mode relies on a built-in sensor to automatically adjust the fan speed based on the amount of smaller particles in the air. You can check out the readings for yourself in the app.&nbsp;</p><p>The standalone Starkvind will be available in black and white, while the side table comes in a dark or light finish. Both will arrive in IKEA stores and online in October.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/ikea-starkvind-smart-air-purifier-table-080021160.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">01439064-0455-4d94-8139-8d98e43fbc8e</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 02 Aug 2021 08:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627471728</ingested><modified>2021-07-28T11:28:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b5e55a30-ef93-11eb-b5cd-2e3ccf2b1e66" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/b5e55a30-ef93-11eb-b5cd-2e3ccf2b1e66" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[IKEA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[IKEA air purifier]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[IKEA air purifier]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google is now offering a permanent Chromecast and Stadia Controller bundle]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With Stadia becoming available on Chromecast with Google TV <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-stadia-chromecast-with-google-tv-android-tv-160131677.html">in June</a>, a bundle with the streaming dongle and a Stadia Controller made a lot of sense.

Multiple Sky videos reportedly violated rules denying the existence of the new coronavirus or claiming that hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were effective treatments.</p><p>The clips didn&#39;t provide &quot;sufficient countervailing context&quot; to indicate the claims were false, YouTube told <em>The Guardian</em>. YouTube warned there was the potential for &quot;real-world harm&quot; from these videos. This just one &quot;strike&quot; against Sky — two more would lead to a permanent channel ban.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Sky said it found older videos that broke YouTube&#39;s rules, but rejected claims that any of its hosts denied COVID-19&#39;s existence. The broadcaster&#39;s digital editor alleged that YouTube was threatening free thought, although YouTube is notably focusing on demonstrable facts, not opinions.</p><p>The TV network has come under fire for its stance on COVID-19, particularly from host Alan Jones. He falsely claimed the SARS-CoV-2 virus was &quot;not a pandemic&quot; in 2020, and in July incorrectly maintained that the virus&#39; Delta variant was neither dangerous nor affected by vaccines. An uproar over those last statements prompted Sky to make a formal apology on July 19th, removing the relevant video at the same time.</p><p>The suspension won&#39;t dramatically damage Sky&#39;s Australian revenue. It&#39;s still rare for YouTube to take that kind of action against a major media network, though. The move also sends a signal — large outlets can&#39;t count on their size to shield them against YouTube crackdowns.</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-sky-news-australia-ban-covid-misinformation-213810128.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3333b100-94c4-4f83-a01f-550665d4d898</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 21:38:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627853892</ingested><modified>2021-08-01T21:38:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-10/3604f560-f426-11e9-af36-2c4361ae4716" width="5315" height="3533" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/3604f560-f426-11e9-af36-2c4361ae4716" width="5315" height="3533" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Future Publishing via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - JUNE 4: Detail of the YouTube logo outside the YouTube Space studios in London, taken on June 4, 2019.

The preliminary settlement also requires tougher security measures, such as warning about participants with third-party apps and offering special privacy-oriented training to Zoom staff.</p><p>Judge Lucy Koh said the company was largely protected against zoombombing claims thanks to the Communications Decency Act&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/congress-senate-section-230-hearing-predictable-195435541.html">Section 230</a> safeguards against liability for users&#39; actions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The settlement could also lead to payouts if the lawsuit achieves a proposed class action status, but don&#39;t expect a windfall. Subscribers would receive a refund of either 15 percent or $25, whichever was larger, while everyone else would receive as much as $15. Lawyers intended to collect up to $21.25 million in legal costs.</p><p>In a statement, Zoom denied doing anything wrong and said that privacy and security were &quot;top priorities.&quot; The company previously agreed to settle a Federal Trade Commission complaint over similar privacy issues, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-09-zoom-will-remove-server-behind-mac-security-hole.html">permanent web server</a> it installed on Macs.</p><p>Zoom <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-02-zoom-user-trust-privacy-security-review.html">scrambled to bolster security</a> for its video chats after a surge in pandemic-related use drew attention to vulnerabilities in its software and services.  It started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-rollout-183517995.html">rolling out end-to-end encryption</a> in October 2020, conducted reviews and made zoombombing more difficult.

However, it does mark a rare instance of Google cutting off basic functionality for older Android versions, not just OS updates or Play Services features. Think of this as Google setting a baseline — you&#39;ll need a device updated within the last decade to receive at least rudimentary support.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-ends-sign-in-support-for-old-android-versions-193130157.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4c1f143b-3987-4d73-be2c-c77b5fd8533e</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 19:31:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627846295</ingested><modified>2021-08-01T19:31:42+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd178780-f2f6-11eb-bfeb-1599d11a478b" width="3499" height="2331" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/cd178780-f2f6-11eb-bfeb-1599d11a478b" width="3499" height="2331" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[- via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mario Queiroz, Vice President of Product Management for Google, holds up the Nexus One smartphone running on the Google Android platform, the first mobile phone the internet company will sell directly to consumers, during a news conference at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California on January 5, 2010.

It likely made a small number of titanium Apple Watches and stopped production &quot;months ago&quot; in anticipation of switching focus to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-leak-and-body-temperature-132421478.html">Series 7</a>, according to Gurman, but ran out prematurely as sales remained relatively strong.

The tech giant has frequently shaken up its Watch Edition strategy, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-07-apple-killed-off-its-super-expensive-gold-edition-watches.html">ditching its solid gold originals</a> in favor of more affordable ceramic and, eventually, titanium. It might decide that the costs of manufacturing upscale watches doesn&#39;t justify the comparatively meager sales. There&#39;s always the Hermès models if you want to splurge. At the same time, though, titanium versions don&#39;t cost that much more in practice — and they might serve as halo watches that attract conventional watch enthusiasts as well as the wealthy.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-edition-titanium-unavailable-152716696.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">ea95d0cd-7e81-4496-8f1d-7a6bbae80495</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 01 Aug 2021 15:27:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627831638</ingested><modified>2021-08-01T15:27:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commodity Markets]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4fb75f00-f2d7-11eb-87d6-2bc8adbc1d28" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4fb75f00-f2d7-11eb-87d6-2bc8adbc1d28" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple Watch Edition Series 6 in titanium]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Edition Series 6 in titanium]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Over 100 warship locations have been faked in one year]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/police-get-google-location-data-george-floyd-protests-183114536.html">Abuses of location technology</a> might just result in hot political disputes. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fake-warships-ais-signals-russia-crimea/">According</a> to <em>Wired, </em>SkyWatch and Global Fishing Watch have <a href="https://skytruth.org/2021/07/systematic-data-analysis-reveals-false-vessel-tracks/">conducted</a> studies showing that over 100 warship locations have been faked since August 2020, including the British aircraft carrier <em>Queen Elizabeth</em> and the US destroyer <em>Roosevelt</em>. In some cases, the false data showed the vessels entering disputed waters or nearing other countries&#39; naval bases — movements that could spark international incidents.</p><p>The research team found the fakes by comparing uses of the automatic identification system (AIS, a GPS-based system to help prevent collisions) with verifiable position data by using an identifying pattern. All of the false info came from shore-based AIS receivers while satellites showed the real positions, for instance. Global Fishing Watch had been investigating fake AIS positions for years, but this was the first time it had seen falsified data for real ships.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s not certain who&#39;s faking locations and why. However, analysts said the data was characteristic of a common perpetrator that might be Russia. Almost all of the affected warships were from European countries or NATO members, and the data included bogus incursions around Kaliningrad, the Black Sea, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-30-apple-to-review-disputed-borders-in-maps.html">Crimea</a> and other Russian interests. In theory, Russia could portray Europe and NATO as aggressors by falsely claiming those rivals sent warships into Russian seas.</p><p>Russia has historically denied hacking claims. It has a years-long history of using fake accounts and misinformation to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-09-25-russia-linked-facebook-ads-exploited-social-divisions.html">stoke political tensions</a> that further its own ends, though. And if Russia is connected, the faked warship locations might be a significant escalation of that strategy. Even though such an approach might not lead to shooting matches, it could get disconcertingly close.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/warship-fake-locations-221800228.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99a37a83-edd4-47d8-8fc4-88cdbf618195</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 22:18:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627769882</ingested><modified>2021-07-31T22:18:09+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/63697eb0-f247-11eb-bd7f-00dcafc086fa" width="4541" height="3027" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/63697eb0-f247-11eb-bd7f-00dcafc086fa" width="4541" height="3027" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Murad Sezer / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[U.S. Navy Arleigh-Burke class destroyer USS Roosevelt (DDG 80) sets sail in the Bosphorus, returning from the Black Sea, in Istanbul, Turkey October 2, 2020.

The <em>New York Times</em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/27/science/lunar-rover-apollo-nasa.html">noted</a> that July 31st, 2021 <a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1421173756458831875">marks</a> the 50th anniversary of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-across-the-airless-wilds-earl-smith-custom-house-153003777.html">Lunar Roving Vehicle&#39;s</a> first outing — and the first time people drove on the Moon. Apollo 15 astronauts Dave Scott and Jim Irwin took the car on a stint to collect samples and explore the lunar surface more effectively than they could on foot.</p><p>Scott and Irwin would eventually drive the rover two more times (for a total of three hours) before returning to Earth. The Apollo 16 and 17 missions each had an LRV of their own. There was also a fourth rover, but it was used for spare parts after the cancellation of Apollo 18 and further missions. All three serving models remained on the Moon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Early development was problematic, in no small part due to the lack of real-world testing conditions. They couldn&#39;t exactly conduct a real-world test drive, after all. The team eventually settled on a collapsible design with steel mesh wheels that could safely handle the Moon&#39;s low gravity, lack of atmosphere, extreme temperatures and soft soil.</p><p>The LRV was modest, with a 57-mile range, four 0.19kW motors and an official top speed of 8MPH. It was also expensive, with cost overruns bringing the price of four rovers to $38 million (about $249 million in 2021 dollars). It was key to improved scientific exploration during the later stages of the Apollo program, though, and it was also an early example of a practical electric vehicle — humans were using a battery-powered ride on the Moon decades before the technology became mainstream on Earth.</p><p>We wouldn&#39;t count on humans driving on the Moon any time soon, although that reflects the progress made in the 50 years since. NASA and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-17-china-yutu2-discovered-moon-mantle-material.html">other space agencies</a> are now focused on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-astrobotic-lunar-cube-rover-165307453.html">robotic rovers</a> that can explore the Moon without worries about crew safety. Those humans that do go on rides will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-gm-lockheed-martin-artemis-vehicle-131521711.html">likely use autonomous vehicles</a>.

While Unjected bills itself as a place to find others who support &quot;medical autonomy and free speech,&quot; social posts on the site have included false claims that vaccines modify genes, connect to 5G and serve as &quot;bioweapons.&quot;</p><p>The app founders are also embroiled in a fight over their Android app. Google told Unjected on July 16th that it had two weeks to remove the misleading posts from its app to avoid a Play Store ban. The developers responded by pulling the social feed. However, co-creator Shelby Thompson said Unjected planned to defy the request by restoring both the feed and the offending posts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>We&#39;ve asked Apple and Google for comment. Unjected still has a presence on Instagram despite that social network&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rfk-jr-kicked-off-instagram-171539088.html">anti-misinformation stance</a>, although that account mostly promotes its views on &quot;freedom&quot; and only occasionally mentions falsehoods, such as incorrect claims that mRNA vaccines alter DNA. We&#39;ve asked Facebook for a response as well.</p><p>Unjected is small compared to mainstream social networks, with roughly 18,000 app downloads (according to Apptopia). However, the crackdown clearly serves as a warning — Apple and Google won&#39;t tolerate apps that knowingly accept and encourage the creation anti-vax content, even if they aren&#39;t directly producing that material.</p><p><strong>Update 7/31 6:18PM ET:</strong> Apple told Engadget that Unjected violated rules demanding reliable COVID-19 information from trustworthy sources, like health agencies and medical institutions. The tech firm further accused Unjected of less-than-honest tactics. The app producer reversed changes made to comply with App Store rules, and encouraged users to help it dodge those rules by avoiding the use of telltale words. Trying to cheat the system is itself grounds for a ban, according to Apple. Don&#39;t expect Unjected to come back.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-pulls-unjected-anti-vax-app-172231369.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f3ddc147-4e94-4f95-ac97-8a5ce3654b07</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 17:22:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627770416</ingested><modified>2021-07-31T22:27:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/2e05ce90-be6c-11eb-8fb5-642cfc0fd443" width="7825" height="5219" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/2e05ce90-be6c-11eb-8fb5-642cfc0fd443" width="7825" height="5219" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Morsa Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A healthcare Worker hands in surgical gloves pulling COVID-19 vaccine liquid from vial to vaccinate a patient]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[A Healthcare Worker Prepares a Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine.]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[DOJ: Hackers behind SolarWinds attacks targeted federal prosecutors]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The perpetrators of the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/us-russia-solarwinds-hack-retaliation-microsoft-china-165525103.html">SolarWinds hacks</a> apparently targeted key parts of the American legal system. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-europe-russia-election-2020-5486323e455277b39cd3283d70a7fd64">According</a> to the <em>AP,</em> the Justice Department says hackers targeted federal prosecutors between May 2020 and December 2020.

From the afternoon in December 1966 that he first tried out the Manned Maneuvering Unit in a Martin Marietta simulator, he was hooked on a vision of a gas-propelled jetpack that would allow astronauts to operate outside their spacecraft. This vision had an obvious pop-culture antecedent. In the 1920s a comic-strip character named Buck Rogers — a rock-jawed, All-American World War I veteran — succumbed to the effects of a mysterious gas he encountered while working as a mine inspector. He fell into a deep sleep and woke after five centuries of slumber to a strange new world of spaceships, ray guns, and Asian over-lords. Though he initially traveled this new world via an antigravity belt, a device that allowed him and his best gal, Wilma, to leap great distances at a time, Buck eventually acquired a svelte and evidently omnidirectional jetpack. He eventually ventured into space in an adventure called <em>Tiger Men from Mars</em>, and his exploits in the cosmos changed America’s vision of the future forever. Millions followed Buck’s adventures in the funnies, on radio, and in movie serials. Among Buck’s imitators and spiritual heirs are Flash Gordon, Brick Bradford, John Carter of Mars, and Han Solo.</p><p>A host of talented men and women spent significant amounts of time and money to wrestle that jetpack out of the funny papers and into the space shuttle. None worked harder, though, than Bruce McCandless and his chief collaborator, an Auburn-educated engineer and Air Force officer named Charles Edward (“Ed”) Whitsett, Jr. Whitsett was a pale, bespectacled individual, mild-mannered but tenacious. He had a head start on my father. He’d been thinking and writing about jetpack technology as early as 1962. In a sense, he was trying to solve a problem that didn’t exist yet: Namely, how could an astronaut venture outside his or her spaceship and perform constructive tasks in an environment with no oxygen, with extreme temperature fluctuations, and in an orbital “free fall” that would leave the spacefarer lolling in the practical equivalent of zero gravity? Alexei Leonov of the Soviet Union and American Ed White had proven that extravehicular activity was possible, that men could survive outside of their space capsule, but basically all they’d done was float. How could a man move from one part of a spaceship to another, or from one spacecraft to another craft, or from a spacecraft to a satellite, in order to make inspections or repairs? None of these needs really existed in the early sixties, when the programs of both nations were still just trying to fire tin cans into low Earth orbit and predict, more or less, where they would come back down. But clearly the needs would eventually arise, and various methods were proposed to address them.</p><p>In the mid-sixties, the Air Force assigned Whitsett to NASA to supervise development of the Air Force’s Astronaut Maneuvering Unit. Gene Cernan’s failed test flight of the AMU on Gemini 9 in 1966 — the “space-walk from hell,” as Cernan called it — set the jetpack project back, but it never went away. McCandless, Whitsett, and a NASA engineer named Dave Schultz worked quietly but assiduously to keep the dream alive. They enlarged and improved the AMU all through the latter half of the decade and into the seventies. In the “Forgotten Astronauts” wire story that portrayed him as a washout in 1973, my dad mentioned the reason why he wanted to stay in the manned space program despite not having won a crew assignment on either Apollo or Skylab. “McCandless,” said the article, “has helped develop the M509 experimental maneuvering unit. The Skylab astronauts strap it on like a backpack and propel themselves Buck Rogers — like around the Skylab interior. [He] wants to build a larger operational unit to perform space chores outside the shuttle.” And that’s exactly what he did.</p><p>Though the Skylab M509 tests in 1973 and 1974 were a resounding success, resulting in the triumph of the jetpack concept over both rocket boots and the handheld maneuvering unit, Whitsett and McCandless didn’t rest on their laurels. Over the next several years, using whatever time and funding they could scrape together, the team made multiple upgrades — eleven, by one count — to what was now being called the “manned maneuvering unit,” or MMU. The bulbous nitrogen-gas fuel tank of the ASMU was replaced with two streamlined aluminum tanks in the rear of the unit, each of which was wrapped in Kevlar. The number of propulsion nozzles was increased from fourteen to twenty-four, positioned around the jetpack to allow for six-degrees-of-freedom precision maneuvering. Smaller gyroscopes replaced those used on the ASMU, and, as space historian Andrew Chaikin has noted, the ASMU’s “pistol-grip hand controllers, which were tiring to operate in pressurized space suit gloves, were replaced by small T-handles that needed just a nudge of the fingertips.” The MMU’s new arm units were made to be adjustable, to accommodate astronauts of all sizes. Painted white for maximum reflectivity, the unit was built to survive the 500-degree fluctuation in temperatures (from a high of 250 degrees F to a low of minus 250 F!) that an astronaut might encounter in space.</p><p>By 1980 the machine weighed in at 326 pounds. Like the AMU and the ASMU before it, the MMU was designed to fit with or “over” the astronaut’s pressure suit. Shuttle astronauts wore a newly designed suit called the Extravehicular Maneuvering Unit, or EMU, a two-piece marvel of textile engineering made up of fourteen layers of Nylon ripstop, Gore-Tex, Kevlar, Mylar, and other substances. Power for the jetpack’s electronics was supplied by two 16.8-volt silver-zinc batteries. Two motion-control handles — the translational hand controller and the rotational hand controller — were mounted on the unit’s left and right armrests, respectively, and a button activated an “attitude-hold mode,” which used motion-sensing gyroscopes to direct the firing of the thrusters to maintain an astronaut’s position in space.</p><p>The machine had been tested in every way its designers could imagine. A representative of a local gun club visited Martin Marietta and shot the MMU’s nitrogen fuel tank with a .50 caliber bullet to ascertain whether the tank would explode if pierced. (It didn&#39;t.) The jetpack was run through hundreds of hours of simulations. At my father’s urging, a gifted and intense Martin Marietta project manager named Bill Bollendonk subjected the device to space-like conditions in the company’s thermal vacuum facility. The MMU was no longer a “far out” experiment, as Mike Collins once called it. It was now a promising space tool. Unfortunately, for the moment, it was still an unused space tool. American astronauts remained on Earth, as NASA struggled to produce its next-generation orbital workhorse, the space shuttle.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-wonders-all-around-bruce-mc-candless-iii-green-leaf-book-group-153027314.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49668cb9-798a-46b4-8cca-bf5dde2026d5</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jul 2021 15:30:27 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627578020</ingested><modified>2021-07-29T17:00:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/d2bb5450-efea-11eb-bfff-89891a0602ee" width="1600" height="901" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/92f1e6b0-efe8-11eb-acfd-bd2e5c0bdf03" width="1366" height="768" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NASA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Bruce McCandless during the first untethered EVA]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bruce McCandless during the first untethered EVA]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Telegram's video calls can now accommodate up to 1,000 viewers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Telegram has <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/video-1000">expanded</a> the group video calling feature it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/telegram-group-video-calls-mobile-desktop-tablet-150020126.html">launched</a> in June to be able to accommodate more participants — a <em>lot</em> more.

On Friday, the <a href="https://www.gao.gov/press-release/statement-blue-origin-dynetics-decision?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=gaolegal">watchdog said</a> NASA’s “evaluation of all three proposals was reasonable and consistent with applicable procurement law, regulation, and the announcement’s terms.”</p><p>When Blue Origin first challenged the lunar lander contract in April, the company claimed the selection process was “fundamentally unfair” because it didn’t get a chance to revise its bid. To that point, NASA could afford to give SpaceX the contract because the company agreed to modify its payment schedule. Blue Origin also took issue with the fact that the space agency selected a single contractor for the project when the initial announcement had called for two manufacturers to be involved.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In reviewing NASA’s decision, the GAO says the space agency “did not violate procurement law or regulation when it decided to make only one award.” It notes NASA gave itself the flexibility to hand out a single contract, multiple awards or none at all when it first announced the Human Landing System program.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, the GAO concluded there “was no requirement for NASA to engage in discussions, amend, or cancel the announcement” due to the amount of funding it had available for the project. Notably, the GAO also points in its press release that its role is not to judge the relative merits of a contract decision. Both Blue Origin and Dynetics had argued that NASA chose the most “high risk option available” since SpaceX’s bid involved its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-starship-orbital-test-flight-155125322.html">Starship rocket</a>, which at that point in the procurement process had <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-sn15-223714843.html">yet to land in one piece</a>.</p><p>&quot;We stand firm in our belief that there were fundamental issues with NASA’s decision, but the GAO wasn’t able to address them due to their limited jurisdiction. We’ll continue to advocate for two immediate providers as we believe it is the right solution,&quot; a spokesperson for Blue Origin said following the decision. &quot;We’ve been encouraged by actions in Congress to add a second provider and appropriate additional resources to NASA&#39;s pursuit to return Americans to the Moon. We’re also very encouraged by Administrator Nelson’s comments over the past week that reaffirm NASA’s original intent to provide simultaneous competition.

In response to the tragedy, the Honda EV engineer developed an in-shoe navigation system, dubbed Ashirase (both the name of the product and the name of the company) that allows low-sighted people to use their feet to navigate, rather than cell phones or other visual aids. The tactile navigation system has earned the financial backing of Honda’s Ignition startup incubator program and continues to gain traction.</p><p>The Ashirase system is two-part, consisting of the dedicated Ashirase navigation app running on the user’s smartphone and a silicone shoe insert cradling a combination motion sensor-electronic compass. Once the user programs their walking destination into the app, the shoe inserts will vibrate in various patterns and tempos — “walk forward” causes vibrations under the balls of the feet, “turn left” rubs the appropriate side of both feet and the speed at which the inserts vibrate indicate proximity to the turn or obstacle.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The idea behind the system is to allow users to remain more aware of their surroundings while they walk, using their feet to navigate rather than repeatedly stopping to consult their smartphones or passersby for directions.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/26270060-f150-11eb-bfb1-49fd28a7bcd4" style="height:1059;width:1600;" alt="Ashirase" data-uuid="5eb0328c-9d91-3a42-b42b-e3766a9c2d3f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Ashirase</div></figure><p>Currently the insert prototypes can only be used in low top sneakers and dress shoes but Chino already has plans to expand the footwear selection. “We are thinking about [new footwear styles], and the idea is twofold at this moment,” Chino told Engadget through an interpreter. “One is to try to change, modifying the [electronic] device so that the shape can be fitted to other types of shoes.”</p><p>“Otherwise,” he continued, “what we can do is to change the yellow parts of this device so that it fits other types of shoes” noting that the white “puck”part can be disconnected from the flexible yellow insert that sits around the wearer’s foot and houses the various vibrating navigation gyroscopes. The system has a reported week-long battery life when using the system to navigate an average of three hours a day. Initially, the insert will be offered in generic small, medium and large sizes in Japan but he plans to offer more personalized fittings once the product hits market.</p><p>The navigation system is currently a bit limited, based on the Google Maps API rather than an HD map source, in that it will work so long as a navigation data signal is available. That means that the system may not initially work in indoor areas like malls or hotels — though hiking trails, parks and other public lands should be no problem.</p><p>Chino and his team are reportedly looking into incorporating either a Personal Dead-reckoning (PDR) system, Wi-Fi-based positioning or IoT navigation capability to help users make their ways through indoor public spaces at a later date. The team also reportedly plans to add public transportation options to the program in the future.</p><p>The company plans to release a beta version of the Ashirase system in Japan in October or November of this year. Users will be given free use of the insert and app for one week before being asked for feedback. Following the public beta, Ashirase executives expect the commercialized product to be ready by October 2022 and include a 2,000 - 3,000 yen ($18 - $27) monthly subscription.</p><p>Before that can happen, however, the startup is seeking some 200 million yen in additional funding — not including the 70 million yen in equity the Ignition program already provided — in order to scale up to full production.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/this-toe-tickling-navigation-system-will-help-the-visually-impaired-walk-tall-170058461.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eb81719c-7c23-4e4b-8dfc-48538571f245</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 17:00:58 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1627662309</ingested><modified>2021-07-30T16:25:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ac3329a0-f0f5-11eb-bff7-0b4b4ecf4732" width="1600" height="1065" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ac3329a0-f0f5-11eb-bff7-0b4b4ecf4732" width="1600" height="1065" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ashirase LLC]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ashirase in-shoe navigation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ashirase in-shoe navigation]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spotify's Noteable Releases playlist showcases the songwriters behind popular music]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the better part of its recent history, Spotify’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-07-20-spotify-discover-weekly-playlist.html">Discover Weekly</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-08-05-spotifys-release-radar-playlist-new-music.html">Release Radar playlists</a> have been the company’s go-to way to help people discover new music.

Expect to see contributions from people like frequent Billie Eilish collaborator Finneas O’Connell and Ester Dean, who helped write Katy Perry’s 2010 hit “Firework.” The result is an eclectic playlist that doesn’t stick to any one genre, though pop music is represented strongly for obvious reasons.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The introduction of Noteable Releases follows last year’s rollout of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-12-spotify-songwriter-pages-beta.html">songwriter pages</a> and is another example of the company trying to cater to the broader music industry. You’ll notice at the top of the playlist that Spotify encourages digging into a song’s credits to find out more about the people who worked on it.
