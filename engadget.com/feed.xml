You can get an <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:AirTag" href="https://fave.co/3jiKWNx">AirTag</a> from the online retailer for $26 today only, which is 10 percent off its normal price. Woot <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtag-four-pack-sale-140051531.html">knocked</a> the price of a four-pack down to $95 earlier this month, and while this price for one AirTag isn&#39;t as cheap as that, it remains the best discount we&#39;ve seen on a single pack. Just make sure to familiarize yourself with <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Woot&#39;s return policy" href="https://fave.co/3hQFqju">Woot&#39;s return policy</a> before picking one up.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3jiKWNx" id="a248b5aac5e14122bf312c47fc582914" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Woot;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Apple AirTag at Woot - $26</a><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airtags-trackers-first-look-hands-on-130036848.html">AirTags</a> are the trackers to get if you live within the Apple ecosystem. They pair just as quickly to iOS device as AirPods do and those with newer iPhones can use Precision Finding to see when they&#39;re close to their lost items. From the Find My app, you can force the AirTag to play a chime to better direct you to your things, and if the item isn&#39;t anywhere near you, the app can show you its last known location. With Lost Mode enabled, you&#39;ll get an alert when Apple&#39;s network of devices detects the location of the AirTag in question, and you can choose to share your phone number and message — just in case someone else finds your stuff.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Aside from the fact that AirTags will only work with Apple devices — sorry Android fans — the biggest problem with them is their lack of a keyring hole. So unless you plan on sticking the tracker in the folds of a wallet or a backpack pocket, you&#39;ll need an AirTag holder to hook it onto your keys and other items. Thankfully, you don&#39;t need to drop more than the price of the tracker itself on one of Apple&#39;s own cases; there are plenty of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">solid, affordable third-party AirTag cases</a> out there right now. Also, while an AirTag&#39;s battery should last for a year, it&#39;s wise to keep a couple of extra watch batteries on hand for when you inevitably need to replace it.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-airtags-are-10-percent-off-at-woot-today-only-131007796.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4378543b-a2f0-49d3-9ba5-3e6a825ef20a</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:10:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634821473</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T13:04:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-04/85166150-a336-11eb-86ac-d7874ea0dfbc" width="2400" height="1350" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirTags]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook Messenger adds AR effects and games to group calls]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-messenger-portal-spark-ar-170048646.html">Facebook Messenger&#39;s augmented reality effects</a> are no longer limited to individuals. The social media company has introduced a Group Effects feature that, as the name implies, enables AR effects for everyone in a video call.

The service is powered by a new gaming supercomputer called the GeForce Now SuperPod and costs double the price of the current <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-nows-price-increase-new-features-180648780.html">Priority tier</a>.</p><p>The SuperPod is &quot;the most powerful gaming supercomputer ever built,&quot; according to NVIDIA, delivering 39,200 TFLOPS, 11,477, 760 CUDA Cores and 8,960 CPU Cores. NVIDIA said it will provide an experience equivalent to 35 TFLOPs, or triple the Xbox Series X, roughly equal to a PC with an 8-core CPU, 28GB of DDR4-3200 RAM and a PCI-GEN4 SSD.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9fb8f9d0-325d-11ec-bf9c-44ba371e8c1d" style="height:1125;width:2000;" alt="NVIDIA launches GeForce Now RTX 3080-class gaming at up to 1440p 120fps" data-uuid="44dbf143-8ef2-3271-9d6c-1ec0ca74a0a9"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NVIDIA</div></figure><p>As such, you&#39;ll see 1440p gaming at up to 120fps on a Mac or PC, and even 4K HDR on a shield, though NVIDIA didn&#39;t mention the refresh rate for the latter. It&#39;ll also support 120 fps on mobile, &quot;supporting next-gen 120Hz displays,&quot; the company said. By comparison, the GeForce Now Priority tier is limited to 1080p at 60 fps, with adaptive VSync available in the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-nows-price-increase-new-features-180648780.html">latest update</a>.</p><p>It&#39;s also promising a &quot;click-to-pixel&quot; latency down to 56 milliseconds, thanks to tricks like adaptive sync that reduces buffering, supposedly beating other services and even local, dedicated PCs. However, that&#39;s based on a 15 millisecond round trip delay (RTD) to the GeForce Now data center, something that obviously depends on your internet provider and where you&#39;re located.&nbsp;</p><p>NVIDIA&#39;s claims aside, it&#39;s clearly a speed upgrade over the current GeForce Priority tier, whether you&#39;re on a mobile device or PC. There&#39;s a price to pay for that speed, though. The GeForce Now premium tier started at $50 per year and recently doubled to $100, which is already a pretty big ask. But the RTX 3080 tier is $100 for six months (around double the price) &quot;in limited quantities,&quot; with Founders and priority early access starting today. If it lives up to the claims, it&#39;s cheaper than buying a new PC, in any case.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nvidia-geforce-now-introduces-an-rtx-3080-tier-for-up-to-1440-p-120-fps-gaming-130011568.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c0efd587-f276-4580-aa27-a6cf9777422f</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:00:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634814825</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T11:13:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8cd0dcf0-3255-11ec-96f6-ee9ffbbd2d0c" width="1280" height="680" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/8cd0dcf0-3255-11ec-96f6-ee9ffbbd2d0c" width="1280" height="680" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NVIDIA]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[NVIDIA launches GeForce Now RTX 3080-class gaming at up to 1440p 120fps]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NVIDIA launches GeForce Now RTX 3080-class gaming at up to 1440p 120fps]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TCL's Tab Pro 5G is a $400 tablet that connects to Verizon's mmWave network]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a few short years, the cost of 5G access has dropped dramatically. What used to be a feature you could only find on premium devices like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-25-samsung-5g-galaxy-s10-hands-on.html"><ins>Samsung S10 5G</ins></a> has made its way to phones as affordable as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-a-review-android-midrange-5g-smartphone-160051630.html"><ins>$449 Pixel 5a</ins></a>. But we haven’t seen that trend play out the same way in the tablet space. For the most part, you still either have to pay a premium or forgo the feature altogether. Enter the TCL Tab Pro 5G, a new $400 tablet that’s exclusive to Verizon and comes with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-23-how-5g-makes-use-of-millimeter-waves.html">n260 and n261 mmWave support</a>.</p><p>Outside of the fact it can connect to a 5G network, the most intriguing aspect of the Tab Pro 5G is that it comes with an 8,000mAh battery. With TCL’s On-the-Go reverse charging, you can use the tablet as an impromptu power bank for your other devices. Powering the Tab Pro 5G alone, TCL claims you can expect about 17 hours of mixed-use battery life. Using the included 18W power adapter, it takes about four hours to charge the device to full.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/fe541720-31dd-11ec-bf75-93c28fb6554f" style="height:1200;width:1600;" alt="TCL Tab Pro 5G" data-uuid="1c07c284-4bba-3bbb-a726-911bcd2183e1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">TCL</div></figure><p>Otherwise, the Tab Pro 5G is about what you would expect when it comes to a $400 tablet. Internally, it features a Qualcomm 480 5G chip, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. You can add up to 1TB of additional space through a micro SD card. The 10.36-inch 1,200 x 2,000 resolution display is limited to 60Hz but includes TCL’s NXTVISION technology, which allows it to convert an SDR video into an HDR one. For taking photos, it comes with a 13-megapixel main camera and an 8-megapixel selfie shooter.</p><p>The Tab Pro 5G is available to buy today from Verizon. If you purchase online, you can save $100 on the tablet through the carrier’s Buy More, Save More Promo — but that means also buying an eligible Android phone.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tcl-tab-pro-5g-annoucement-verizon-130009144.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b7c6b201-bd61-4802-921e-c6bb2228d245</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634759590</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T19:53:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cedf8010-31dd-11ec-a7dd-dd9c78b0ccd5" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/cedf8010-31dd-11ec-a7dd-dd9c78b0ccd5" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[TCL]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[TCL Tab Pro 5G]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[TCL Tab Pro 5G]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Surface Duo 2 review: Microsoft's second dual-screen hybrid is a letdown]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="5b611e69ef744940a6acbe70f33d82e3"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7hb06S7Pjew" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Microsoft isn’t giving up on its dual-screen dreams. The company is back this year with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-hands-on-price-specs-buggy-update-triple-camera-160008199.html">a new Surface Duo</a> that looks like it might fix some of the original’s flaws. Instead of a finicky and low-quality camera, the Duo 2 packs a triple-sensor system on its rear, in addition to a selfie shooter inside. The device also has a narrower overall footprint, faster-refreshing screens and some updated software. There’s also support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-151216222.html">Microsoft’s Slim Pen 2</a>, which should make drawing and taking notes a more intuitive experience.</p><p>But despite having addressed many of the previous generation’s issues and adding some useful features, the Duo 2 remains a frustrating device. And at $1,500, it’s still a pricey product with a niche, limited appeal.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Hardware and design changes</h2><p>By now, you’re probably familiar with the Duo’s proposition. The second generation features a pair of 5.8-inch screens connected by a hinge. It’s also running Android 11 this year, with some tweaks to improve multi-display use. Combined, the two panels offer an 8.3-inch canvas, which is slightly bigger than before. You can flip one screen all the way around to use the Duo 2 in a phone-like single-screen state, use one side as a stand to prop up the other half or have both displays facing you like a book or tablet.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-review-software-camera-specs-130024046.html">the original</a>, this thing is an attractive piece of hardware with an impressively thin profile and a sleek silhouette. The Duo 2 is a bit heavier than its predecessor, and even heavier than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review-s-pen-camera-battery-test-190051606.html">the Galaxy Z Fold 3</a>, and I’d chalk most of that gain up to its camera module. Despite the chunky protrusion on the back of the right screen, though, the Duo 2 is evenly weighted and felt balanced when open.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/db43b120-3203-11ec-86ef-fe35c4d66ca9" alt="Side view of the Microsoft Surface Duo 2, showing its rear camera module sandwiched between the backs of its two screens. " data-uuid="91612b88-07d0-3b2a-8f19-ee4bc5c1d5e2"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>My main concern when I first saw the camera bump was that two sides would no longer lay flush against each other when opened all the way up. But the bump was surprisingly unobtrusive, and while I didn’t mind using the Duo 2 as a single-screen device, it’s still a bit too wide to replace my phone, especially for one-handed use. Though the Galaxy Z Fold 3 is heavy and its screen is a little too narrow and cramped, it still offers a better experience in this mode.</p><p>When the panels are back-to-back, the system will keep the last screen you used active, while the other shows a message saying you can double tap it to switch over. It’s basically two phones sandwiching a camera and you can use one side at a time. You’ll notice odd aspect ratio issues here and there, thanks to the uncommon 1,892 x 1,344 resolution, but for the most part apps expand to cover the whole screen nicely if you enable the automatic span setting. It even worked with the notoriously finicky Instagram, except… photo captions would overflow into the edges and get eaten up, and Stories still had blank space flanking them.&nbsp;</p><p>I did appreciate the 90Hz refresh rate when scrolling through my social feeds. The AMOLED panels are lovely, delivering crisp and colorful image and video quality. I do wish they got a bit brighter, though, since they’re about 200 nits dimmer than <a href="https://www.engadget.com/iphone-13-pro-and-pro-max-review-120-hz-promotion-screen-macro-camera-cinematic-mode-samples-battery-life-143041678.html">the iPhone 13 series</a>.</p><p>When closed, the Duo 2 is basically useless since, unlike the Galaxy Z Fold 3, it doesn’t have an “external” screen. If you want to read your notifications while the device is laying on a table, you’ll need to leave it open or with one display facing out.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/09821220-3204-11ec-bfef-e3f51734e7b1" alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo 2&#39;s glance bar showing the time through the hinge." data-uuid="5bd856dc-8e89-3136-b20c-42d880b25b9c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>But Microsoft tries to offer you at least barebones notifications while the Duo 2 is closed via the new Glance Bar. The inside edges of the screens are curved slightly so you can see a little bit of the display through the hinge. When the Glance Bar is enabled, you can see the clock and other system info on this tiny sliver, and it’ll light up in different colors when you have incoming calls or messages. It actually drew my attention to the fact that the Duo 2 didn’t charge overnight by glowing red to indicate the battery was low.</p><p>While the Glance Bar is somewhat helpful, it’s also super tiny, which means you need to have Superman’s eyesight to see the clock from more than, say, a few inches away, which basically defeats the purpose. Plus, the Glance Bar works with just first-party apps for now, which means you’ll only get alerted to text messages and phone calls. Oh, and Teams calls, in case you’re <em>that</em> wired into Microsoft’s ecosystem.</p><h2>The best uses for the Duo 2’s dual-screens</h2><p>You can also use the Duo 2 in a few other modes (or “postures” as Microsoft calls them), thanks to the hinge, which is sturdy and smooth. It’s easy to open without too much force, yet strong enough to prop up one screen without it budging. Perhaps the best way to use the Duo 2 is in Book and Tent modes, the latter of which is wonderful for playing games while seated at a desk. It’s also handy for keeping an eye on Twitter or a YouTube live chat while working on my laptop.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/26928fc0-3204-11ec-9c3c-724c10a30936" alt="A Microsoft Surface Duo 2 with one screen propped up to face out and the other screen laying face down on a table. " data-uuid="904cde38-e3f4-37ac-ab2a-9207ed057e5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Then, when you’re ready to turn your attention to something more intensive, switch over to Book mode and hold the Duo 2 up with both displays facing you. This can be very immersive on any device, and I had a similar feeling with the Z Fold 3. It’s not ideal for idle doomscrolling while you watch TV or firing off a quick reply to your group chats, though. When you have both screens on they basically demand you be actively engaged — whether it’s reading a book, or building a shopping list on one side while looking at recipes on the other.</p><p>The Duo 2 is satisfying in this mode if you’re holding it vertically. Flip to landscape orientation and the entire UI just struggles to keep up, especially if you’re using swipe-based navigation instead of choosing the older Android home screen, with back and recent buttons. In general, the Duo 2 feels a little clumsy when held horizontally.</p><h2>Software quirks remain</h2><p>I want to commend Microsoft for all the work it’s done to improve the Duo 2’s software. Compared to the hot mess of last year’s model, the system feels a little more cohesive. Part of that has to do with better support for multi-screen devices in Android 11. But quirks still remain and they’re still too numerous for me to list individually, so I’m just going to give you a few examples.</p><p>Like I said before, the UI doesn’t know what to do with the swipe-based navigation and in landscape mode, the typical swipe up to go home gesture doesn’t work. Instead, you’ll have to swipe in from the right to either go home or see all apps. To go back, you can only swipe from the left — bad news for anyone who preferred it the other way.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/4597b170-3204-11ec-b73f-a639b873239c" alt="A person holding the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 in book mode showing the Engadget home page. Images and text are eaten up by the hinge. " data-uuid="760ed4f1-78f0-3ca4-8d0e-69c4e3bb09f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>Also, trying to type in this mode is still a pain — you’ll lose more than two thirds of the screen to the keyboard (and a weird row of empty space at the bottom), so good luck trying to see what you composed.</p><p>Even in Book mode there are annoying quirks. There’s a pervasive touch input issue that other reviewers noted on the original Duo and it explains why I felt the Duo 2 is sluggish and finicky. Throughout the system, whether it’s trying to switch lenses in the camera or open the settings menu in a game, the system sometimes just doesn’t register a tap. I’d need to jab at it repeatedly for something to happen.</p><p>There are other issues too, but they happen inconsistently enough that I felt like the Duo 2 was gaslighting me. For example, the Microsoft Start app would randomly launch on the left screen when I had an app on the right. I promise you this wasn’t because I accidentally swiped over to the left to see the Start feed; This is a ghost app that appears on its own. There’s also that Instagram caption overflow problem I mentioned earlier that seemed to go away, but would reappear now and then.</p><section data-eng-breakout="3291f97c5096455ca6a4d116d12bbba9" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/785e59b0-3204-11ec-b95d-3ed0d9ca610b" alt="A close up of the Microsoft Surface Duo 2&#39;s rear camera module. "></section><h2>Camera performance</h2><p>The camera was one of the most frustrating parts of the original Duo, and I was hopeful that the second generation would be vastly improved. Unfortunately, it wasn’t. To be clear, the hardware is better. You get a triple camera system with a 12-megapixel main sensor, a 12-megapixel telephoto lens and a 16-megapixel wide option with a 110-degree field of view. The selfie camera also got an upgrade, going from 11-megapixels to 12.</p><p>Photos taken by the Duo 2 <em>are</em> better. In general, pictures were rich and bright, with sharp details, though the camera struggled in low light. There’s a weird cast in some of the photos where the camera seemed to white balance the same scene differently in back-to-back shots, but that’s a minor issue that other phones face too. More disappointing is the front camera, which delivered noisy, pale shots of my friends and I, and has a tendency to overexpose everything.</p><p>The biggest problem is that the Duo 2’s camera app still sucks. I thought that with a dedicated rear and front camera setup, the system would no longer have to guess what screen you wanted to use as a viewfinder. But instead of letting users decide which cameras they want to use at any time, Microsoft limits when you can use the rear cameras. If you unfold the Duo 2 so that the screens are more than 180 degrees away from each other, Microsoft disables the triple-sensor module and you’re stuck with the selfie option. Presumably, this is to prevent you from accidentally capturing the back of the device, but it just takes away user control. Why should Microsoft lock you out of the superior camera option on the Duo 2 just because the screens are open a little more than 180 degrees?</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/972bf0a0-3204-11ec-b7fd-7b7c102acaea" alt="A person holding up the Microsoft Surface Duo 2 to take a photo of a bookshelf. The screen on the right shows the viewfinder while the screen on the left displays a picture taken earlier. " data-uuid="3c4dd9b8-7aff-3354-bf1b-e4136775525a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>The UI is also supposed to allow you to use the spare screen as a photo viewer, so you can see your shots right after snapping them, but this didn’t happen consistently. And in a 10-minute photo shoot, the app crashed at least three times, showing a generic error message. To top it all off, the camera fails to keep up with rapid-fire shooting, sometimes taking a few seconds to snap a picture and save it to your gallery (I suspect this delay has more to do with the UI trying to pull up the image on the other screen than an actual processor issue). Throw in the touch input lag I mentioned earlier and the entire camera experience is a disaster. It’s as if Microsoft never bothered to test the camera at all.</p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>Beyond the software quirks, the Duo 2’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-5g-gaming-cameras-150046640.html">high-end Snapdragon 888 chipset</a> actually seemed to struggle at times. When I played a few rounds of <em>Airplane Chefs </em>in one-screen mode, the device ran hot and then completely stalled, leaving me unable to serve food to impatient passengers. This doesn’t just occur when I have the two screens flipped all the way around, either. On the whole, the area under the camera module tends to get warm. But when the Duo 2’s sides are stuck back to back, it seems to keep the heat from dissipating quickly enough.</p><p>Then there’s the countless number of times apps have just died on me. I handed the Duo 2 off to a friend with OneNote on the right screen, so they could try the keyboard. It refused to pull up the keyboard and shortly after stopped registering any touches. We closed and opened the device and the app still wasn’t working. Only a force quit revived OneNote. Oh and sometimes when I was using just one screen in landscape mode, a screenshot would capture the home screen instead of the app I was using on it.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/ba6d8380-3204-11ec-bd5b-227f37b87019" alt="The Microsoft Surface Duo 2 stands almost closed, with the logo on its back facing the camera." data-uuid="92ca33ff-74e3-31a2-a40e-2b54f2a4b8f4"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">David Imel for Engadget</div></figure><p>The one thing I’m impressed with is that the Duo 2’s battery life isn’t any worse than before — which is a very low bar. This year’s model clocked 10 hours and 16 minutes with our video rundown test playing on one screen and the Android home page on the other. The original Duo came in at 10 hours and 32 minutes, and considering the faster screens, that seems fair. For what it’s worth, the Fold 3, which has a 120Hz panel, lasted 14 hours and 3 minutes.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>I could go on about all the little ways the Duo 2 struggles, but that would take forever. Some of them are minor and just require a little adjusting, while others, like the camera app, are downright unforgivable. Things Microsoft introduced to improve the experience, like the triple rear cameras and Glance bar, are only slight improvements. I appreciate the faster screens, but at this price they’re almost a given. I haven’t been able to test the Slim Pen 2, but it’s worth noting you’ll have to pay an extra $130 for it.</p><p>Like the Galaxy Z Fold 3, the Duo 2 is suffering a sort of identity crisis. Neither device works well as a phone replacement, but at least Samsung’s foldable has reliable software and good cameras. Despite the improvements, the Duo 2 is still a kind of gimmicky device that’s costly to boot and only people with $1,500 to burn and who really <em>need</em> a dual-screen phone should buy it.</p><p></p><div class="inline-emphasis"><h2>Key specs </h2><p><strong>Processor</strong>: Snapdragon 888 with 8GB of RAM</p><p><strong>Storage</strong>: 128/256/512GB </p><p><strong>MicroSD card support</strong>: None</p><p><strong>Displays</strong>: 2 x 5.8-inch AMOLED at 1,892 x 1,344 (401ppi) with 90Hz adaptive refresh rate; Combined 8.3-inch AMOLED at 2,688 x 1,892</p><p><strong>Rear triple cameras</strong>: 12MP f/1.7 wide-angle camera with OIS; 16MP f/2.2 ultra-wide camera (110-degree FOV); 12MP f/2.4 51mm telephoto camera with 2x optical zoom</p><p><strong>Front camera</strong>: 12MP f/2.0 camera</p><p><strong>Operating system</strong>: Android 11 with Duo 2 UI</p><p><strong>Battery</strong>: 4,449mAh</p><p><strong>Charging</strong>: USB-C port with fast wired charging at 23W.</p><p><strong>Dimensions</strong>:  Open: 184.5 x 145.2 x 5.5 mm (7.26 x 5.71 x 0.21 inches);  Closed: 145.2 x 92.1 x 11.0 mm (7.26 x 3.62 x 0.42 inches)</p><p><strong>Weight</strong>: 10.01 ounces; 284 grams</p><p><strong>Fingerprint sensor</strong>: Yes, on power button</p><p><strong>Waterproofing</strong>: IP68</p><p><strong>NFC</strong>: Yes</p><p><strong>Headphone jack</strong>: No</p></div><p>Photos by David Imel (<a href="https://twitter.com/DurvidImel">@DurvidImel</a>)</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-surface-duo-2-review-camera-sample-specs-glance-bar-130004036.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">59213511-d4f6-47b1-91f2-c82eee36c9af</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 13:00:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634814137</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T11:02:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a03fcff0-3203-11ec-bfd7-6f98d553a93e" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a03fcff0-3203-11ec-bfd7-6f98d553a93e" width="2100" height="1182" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[David Imel for Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Microsoft Surface Duo 2 on a white surface with a bookshelf in the background.

While Raspberry Pi can still produce as many as 7 million units this year, which is the same as last year&#39;s, companies are buying up more components than before to ensure that they can build their products. As a result, Raspberry Pi Zero and the 2GB variant of Raspberry Pi 4 are in short supply.&nbsp;</p><p>To address the issue, the manufacturer is moving back the 2GB Raspberry Pi 4&#39;s price to $45. The model debuted at that price, but Raspberry Pi <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-02-27-35-raspberry-pi-4-double-ram-2-gb.html">lowered</a> it to $35 in 2020 to replace its 1GB counterpart that was discontinued completely. Upton said the price increase in components needed for the boards means selling the 2GB Pi 4 for $35 is no longer economically viable, so the company is temporarily bringing back its old price. It&#39;s also reintroducing the 1GB variant for $35 to give customers another choice.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Upton explained in the post that the issue will affect its products built on 40nm silicon the most. Since the company has to distribute components wisely, it has decided to prioritize Compute Module 3, Compute Module 3+ and Raspberry Pi 3B, and to deprioritize Raspberry Pi 3B+. It&#39;s now encouraging industrial users of the Raspberry Pi 3B+ to use the 1GB variant of Raspberry Pi 4 instead.</p><p>The CEO said those changes are temporary and that the changes in pricing aren&#39;t here to stay. &quot;As global supply chain issues moderate, we’ll keep revisiting this issue, and we want to get pricing back to where it was as fast as we can,&quot; he wrote. That said, the company is expecting its supply chain issues to persist all throughout 2022.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/raspberry-pi-first-ever-price-increase-122509763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c46c142c-7ef2-4abd-ac93-d9e19e7c2284</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 12:25:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634819130</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T12:25:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9f718c60-3264-11ec-9deb-141f2f5c6457" width="900" height="580" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9f718c60-3264-11ec-9deb-141f2f5c6457" width="900" height="580" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Raspberry Pi]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Will Facebook change its name?]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, will Facebook pull the trigger and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-reportedly-changing-name-042958266.html">change its name</a>?

Back in September, <em>Bloomberg</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-vaccination-status-report-185408210.html">reported</a> that Apple asked employees to share their vaccination status voluntarily. Those who refuse to share their vaccine status will also have to undergo daily testing, while vaccinated office workers will only have to do rapid testing once a week.&nbsp;</p><p>The company&#39;s retail store employees, however, won&#39;t be subjected to daily tests despite having consumer-facing jobs. Unvaccinated staff members are required to be tested twice a week. Like Apple&#39;s office workers, vaccinated staff will only have to undergo weekly rapid testing. It&#39;s unclear if the tech giant will ever issue a COVID-19 vaccine mandate, but the Biden administration previously gave all federal contractors a December 8th deadline to require all their employees to be inoculated against the virus. As <em>Bloomberg</em> notes, Apple sells products to the US government.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For now, Apple has reportedly given employees an October 24th deadline to report and show proof of their vaccination status, so it could implement the new rules starting on November 1st. Unvaccinated employees will have to pick-up at-home rapid tests from Apple offices and stores, do the test themselves and then report their results through an internal app.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-require-unvaccinated-employees-covid-19-daily-test-093357015.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9bb97e14-cd2a-4b8a-9392-63495a9ecde7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 09:33:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634808858</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T09:34:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-03/2ff03a40-65ff-11ea-9bff-41df2740846f" width="2765" height="1843" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-03/2ff03a40-65ff-11ea-9bff-41df2740846f" width="2765" height="1843" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ViewApart via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Santa Monica, United States - 21 March,  2015: two unidentified persons watching inside the Apple store on 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica near Los Angeles in California.

He&#39;s calling it <a href="https://truthsocial.com/">TRUTH Social</a>, and the platform is apparently part of his camp&#39;s efforts to fight back against &quot;the Big Tech companies of Silicon Valley, which have used their unilateral power to silence opposing voices in America.&quot;</p><p>Some of Trump&#39;s supporters believe that social networks are biased against conservative voices — in 2018, a group even sued Twitter, Facebook and Google, accusing them of breaking antitrust laws and violating their First Amendment rights by conspiring to suppress conservative viewpoints. The case was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/judges-drop-social-media-anti-conservative-case-175623139.html">tossed</a> out of court a few times. According to a New York University research <a href="https://bhr.stern.nyu.edu/bias-report-release-page">published</a> earlier this year, there&#39;s no evidence of conservative bias on the world&#39;s most popular social networks. There was even an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-bug-heavily-favored-trump-content-over-biden-172758201.html">Instagram bug</a> in the months leading to the US Presidential Elections that favored Trump content over Biden&#39;s.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It is true, however, that Facebook and Twitter banned Trump from their platforms following the January 6th US Capitol riots. Twitter determined that his tweets at that time violated its policies. According to the website, his tweets (which you can view in an <a href="https://www.thetrumparchive.com/">archive</a>) &quot;must be read in the context of broader events in the country and the ways in which the President’s statements can be mobilized by different audiences, including to incite violence...&quot;</p><p>Earlier this month, Trump <a href="https://www.engadget.com/donald-trump-sues-to-get-his-twitter-account-back-143200517.html">sued</a> to get his Twitter account back, arguing that the ban violates his First Amendment rights. Indeed, his ban on the website gets a special mention in TRUTH Social&#39;s announcement. He said in a statement: &quot;We live in a world where the Taliban has a huge presence on Twitter, yet your favorite American President has been silenced.&quot;</p><p>TRUTH Social will have a beta launch in November for invited guests. Trump and his team are expecting to roll it out nationwide in the first quarter of 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/trump-truth-social-061457538.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a4f03eb1-e52a-4bba-add8-62c6cf001b6b</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 21 Oct 2021 06:14:57 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634796917</ingested><modified>2021-10-21T06:15:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/be021f50-322d-11ec-b4eb-ffc306c1df14" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/be021f50-322d-11ec-b4eb-ffc306c1df14" width="3000" height="2001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Scott Olson via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DES MOINES, IOWA - OCTOBER 09: Former President Donald Trump speaks to supporters during a rally at the Iowa State Fairgrounds on October 09, 2021 in Des Moines, Iowa.

Overall, deliveries increased in Q3 by 20 percent compared to the previous quarter and increased by roughly 70 percent over Q3 2020. Tesla executives credit increased production of the Model Y at the Shanghai Gigafactory for the boost in deliveries.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On the technology front, Tesla continues its FSD City Streets beta rollout and plans to &quot;continue to monitor fleet data closely to help facilitate a smooth rollout,&quot; per its quarterly update.&nbsp;</p><p>The company also released a more streamlined iteration of its car companion app that &quot;enables phone key for multiple vehicles simultaneously, allows commands to be sent to the vehicle immediately upon opening the app and integrates the purchase of upgrades, subscriptions and accessories.&quot; New features include Disney+ streaming, a scrolling arcade shooter dubbed Sky Force Reloaded, a &quot;car wash mode,&quot; and various tweaks to improve the vehicle&#39;s cold weather performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking ahead, the company expects to achieve a 50 percent average annual growth in vehicle deliveries &quot;over a multi-year horizon&quot; and eventually reach &quot;industry-leading&quot; operating margins. In the short term, however, &quot;Q4 production will depend heavily on availability of parts, but we are driving for continued growth,&quot; Tesla CFO Zachary Kirkhorn said during the call.</p><p>&quot;Tesla continues to break molds in these [existing] vehicle segments and we hope to do so with each new product,&quot; Martin Viega, Tesla&#39;s Senior Director of Investor Relations, noted. &quot;As we&#39;ve said publicly, we&#39;ll eventually expand the vehicle lineup to get to larger volumes. We believe that we will need to be in all major segments across small and mid-size sedans, SUVs and trucks to do so along with, of course, the massive space of Robo taxi.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-posts-a-wildly-profitable-q3-despite-difficult-car-market-210905631.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a371fbec-7e36-4fec-ae07-d75842a1ceb0</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 21:09:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634767837</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T22:10:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9a62d450-31e6-11ec-bfae-b4fac0a74a1d" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/9a62d450-31e6-11ec-bfae-b4fac0a74a1d" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Barcroft Media via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[YANTAI, CHINA - OCTOBER 17, 2021 - A customer selects a car at a Tesla Experience store in Yantai, East China's Shandong Province, Oct. 17, 2021.

Epic has signed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html">Eyes Out</a>, the brand-spanking-new studio founded by <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em> director Cory Davis and Nine Inch Nails guitarist Robin Finck, and also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-08-05-road-not-taken-review-take-it.html">Spry Fox</a>, a veteran, award-winning indie developer known for heartwarming games such as <em>Cozy Grove</em>, <em>Alphabear</em> and <em>Road Not Taken</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>As a publisher, Epic offers to cover 100 percent of all development costs, and once a game comes out and breaks even in sales, the signed studio receives at least 50 percent of all profits. Epic doesn&#39;t exert creative control over its partnered games, and the developers retain the intellectual property rights to their work. Epic signed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-26-epic-publishing-remedy-playdead-gendesign-games.html">Remedy Entertainment, Playdead and genDESIGN</a> in March 2020, and today&#39;s announcement marks the second batch of contracted studios.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We’re open to publishing many types of games from the most talented developers, and the studios we’re partnering with are making some of the coolest, experimental and ambitious stuff out there,&quot; head of Epic Games Publishing Hector Sanchez told Engadget. &quot;They have our full support – including Epic’s publishing and promotional services, resources, and experience – which means they can focus solely on making the best games possible.&quot;</p><p>Eyes Out is staffed with enormous creative energy, but it&#39;s unproven as a team. Davis, Finck and their collaborators are working on their debut title, a mysterious arthouse horror game with an emphasis on experimental audio and cosmic terror. The studio&#39;s teasers are filled with moody desert landscapes and unsettling layers of sound. In a chat <a href="https://www.engadget.com/eyes-out-nin-robin-finck-cory-davis-horror-audio-game-164531900.html">with Engadget in September</a>, Davis said he wants to &quot;create mind-bending experiences that cause you to question reality.&quot;</p><div id="2b6cc08eb69141a8ac2dbf86eb82c535"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/moPq2z_jYTg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>The publisher relationship goes even deeper for Eyes Out, too — the studio received an Epic MegaGrant in 2019, which gave them the runway to build their first proof-of-concept. Epic further funded the studio&#39;s prototype, allowing them to expand their team in the process. And now, Eyes Out is officially part of Epic Games Publishing.</p><p>&quot;From the very beginning, Robin and I knew that Eyes Out was going to require a unique publishing partner willing to empower our vision of the strange, ambitious worlds we would create together, and one capable of fueling it,&quot; Davis said about today&#39;s news. He continued, &quot;Our collaboration with Epic continued to bear fruit. Working with Epic is really the first time I’ve felt entirely unleashed as a director, both technically and creatively. Together we’re aimed to create the thing that’s closest to my heart.&quot;</p><p>Spry Fox, meanwhile, is working on its most ambitious project to date, which <a href="https://twitter.com/spryfox/status/1450850917696229380">it describes</a> as a &quot;non-violent multiplayer game designed to encourage friendship and reduce loneliness in the world.&quot; It&#39;ll come to multiple platforms, and support cross-play and cross-progression. The first bit of concept art from Spry Fox&#39;s new game depicts a pastel, <em>Atlantis</em>-esque world with a massive yellow whale floating across the sky.</p><p>&quot;This is the first time in our history that we at Spry Fox have chosen to work with a publisher in this manner,&quot; studio co-founder and CEO David Edery said. &quot;Up until now, we have only worked with publishers for much more limited regional publishing and porting arrangements. But we felt for a project as ambitious as this one, we needed more support than usual, and Epic seemed like the right company to provide that support.&quot;</p><div id="f319868e23a24922806eb34b01261e3f"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are excited to announce that we&#39;re working on our next and most ambitious game with the wonderful folks at <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicGamesPub?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EpicGamesPub</a>! It&#39;s a non-violent multiplayer game designed to encourage friendship and reduce loneliness in the world 🥰 <a href="https://t.co/mmTMYLijwF">https://t.co/mmTMYLijwF</a><a href="https://t.co/SPVPPujsku">pic.twitter.com/SPVPPujsku</a></p>— Spry Fox (@spryfox) <a href="https://twitter.com/spryfox/status/1450850917696229380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>Epic has positioned itself as the developer&#39;s publisher, with a goal of having &quot;the most developer-friendly terms in the industry,&quot; emphasizing creative control and financial support for its studios. Outside of direct publishing deals, Epic also offers free access to Unreal Engine, a powerful game-development toolset, and it throws money at artists through programs like <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/megagrants">Epic MegaGrants</a>, a $100 million fund for burgeoning creatives. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-13-epic-games-store-steam-competition.html">Epic Games Store</a> went live in 2018 as a direct competitor to Steam, offering better financial terms for developers and challenging Valve to implement the same deal (spoiler: <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-18-half-life-alyx-valve-steam-stockholders-boo.html">Valve didn&#39;t</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>More recently, Epic waged a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-xcloud-app-store-130053155.html">very public</a> legal battle against Apple, arguing the iPhone-maker enjoyed monopolistic control over the App Store and offered unfair terms to developers. In the end, the lawsuit played out like any other fight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/epic-apple-google-indie-developers-app-store-210830045.html">between multibillion-dollar corporations</a>, resulting in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-epic-games-lawsuit-ruling-app-store-153113436.html">little change</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-court-appeals-epic-games-175240669.html">lots of press</a>.</p><p>Throughout the lawsuit, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney attacked Apple for engaging in greedy, anti-consumer and anti-developer practices. This is kind of his thing — since founding Epic more than 30 years ago, Sweeney has been consistent in his mantra that game development should be accessible to as many people as possible. Even his first game, <em>ZZT</em>, included an editor so everyone who played it could build their own levels.</p><p>&quot;It was in those early days that Epic&#39;s kind of core philosophy was set,&quot; Sweeney <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-20-fortnite-250-million-epic-games-sweeney-interview-gdc.html">told Engadget in 2019</a>. &quot;We both build games ourselves and we share all the results of our work with the world to build their own games. We&#39;re the both a game developer and a service company that works with partners throughout the whole industry. Everything we&#39;re doing now is this much larger version of that.&quot;</p><p>Including, it seems, Epic Games Publishing.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/epic-games-publishing-spry-fox-eyes-out-183420656.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f0cbd79-557f-47b4-bffc-f7ac4fcb255f</guid><dc:creator>Jessica Conditt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 18:34:20 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634755115</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T18:38:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jessica Conditt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a1bc5410-31d2-11ec-979f-31125d4581ff" width="4800" height="2700" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/a1bc5410-31d2-11ec-979f-31125d4581ff" width="4800" height="2700" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Spry Fox]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Epic Games Publishing announcement of Spry Fox and Eyes Out, featuring Spry Fox's concept art.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Epic Games Publishing]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Commerce Department limits sale of hacking tools to Russia and China]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US Commerce Department has <a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/10/commerce-tightens-export-controls-items-used-surveillance-private"><ins>announced new rules</ins></a> related to the export and resale of cyber intrusion software. Once the limits come into effect in 90 days, companies that want to sell their hacking tools to countries “of national security or weapons of mass destruction concern” will need to obtain a license from the department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS).

There are already many limitations on the export of intrusion software. Similarly, there are opportunities for companies to obtain exceptions. The main point is that the policy would cover the sale of software to countries like China and Russia. It would also limit the sale of programs like NSO’s  Pegasus spyware, which some governments have used to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nso-spyware-targeted-journalists-politicians-190234376.html"><ins>target dissidents and journalists</ins></a>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“The United States Government opposes the misuse of technology to abuse human rights or conduct other malicious cyber activities, and these new rules will help ensure that US companies are not fueling authoritarian practices,” the Commerce Department said.</p><p>Among the 42 countries involved in the <a href="https://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/wassenaar"><ins>Wassenaar Arrangement</ins></a>, a pact that sets voluntary export controls on military and dual-use technologies, the US is one of the last to impose limits on the sale of hacking software.

It&#39;s a full-frame interchangeable model that can use either DJI&#39;s DL or Leica M lenses (along with other mirrorless lenses via adapters) and comes with no less than nine built-in neutral-density (ND) filters for controlling exposure.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/f2d1d940-31c5-11ec-859f-308a2e72d806" alt="DJI&#39;s Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system" data-uuid="81654643-dde0-39e3-a68e-c5da7dc5f72e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure><p>It&#39;s available either in a 6K model that can handle 6K at 60fps and 4K at 120fps, or an 8K 75 fps version. It can capture files in RAW, ProRes or H.264, allowing maximum flexibility in production. DJI claims 14 stops of dynamic range, and it should be good in low-light thanks to the dual-native 800/5000 ISO.&nbsp;</p><p>The gimbal itself is one of the first to offer Z-axis stabilization, DJI said. The aim is to reduce vertical jarring when a camera operator walks or runs, a trick that usually requires considerable skill. Helping in that regard is the Ronin 4D&#39;s relatively small size and 4.67 kg (10.3 pounds) heft, excluding the lens and storage card. It uses data from downward time of flight (ToF) sensors, forward and downward dual-visual sensors, a built-in IMU and a barometer. It also comes with DJI&#39;s ActiveTrack Pro (similar to that found on its consumer <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dj-osmo-mobile-5-gimbal-selfie-stick-135559718.html">gimbals</a> and drones), which uses AI to power framing and tracking.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/0321dfc0-31c6-11ec-bcef-11aec4474753" alt="DJI&#39;s Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system" data-uuid="e5b60c0a-f67b-35ad-8ed1-bcab8a22b332"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">tomgo.tang/DJI</div></figure><p>As for the LiDAR focusing system, it offers &quot;43,200 ranging points reaching as far as 10 meters, locating subjects quickly and accurately, even in low-light environments,&quot; DJI said in a press release. It didn&#39;t mention any other autofocus technology used by the camera, though it &quot;supports human face/body recognition and framing of any subject.&quot; It also noted that the system &quot;measures the distance to the subject without relying on surface textures or hunting for edges,&quot; implying it doesn&#39;t employ contrast-detect AF.&nbsp;</p><p>The system supports full autofocus, manual focus and &quot;Automated Manual Focus&quot; (AMF) that allows camera operators to &quot;pull focus with extreme precision.&quot; The general idea with AMF is that the autofocus handles most AF chores, but allows the operate to intervene manually at any point.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/181b2300-31c6-11ec-baef-011c114d466f" alt="DJI&#39;s Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system" data-uuid="93fc25c1-0bfc-388f-a783-7eba1495dd04"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">DJI</div></figure><p>Other features including a long range (20,000 feet) video transmitter that outputs a 1080/60p feed to remote monitors, three storage methods (USB SSD, CFexpress Type-B and DJI&#39;s proprietary PROSSD 1TB), built-in microphones along with 3.5mm mic ports and XLR ports via an expansion plate, and a battery with up to 2.5 hours of shooting time.&nbsp;</p><p>The <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:viglink;pdid:Ronin 4D" href="https://bit.ly/3jkuL2c">Ronin 4D</a> with a 6K camera costs $7,199, while the 8K model is $11,499. Both come with the gimbal, camera, LiDAR range finder, a monitor, hand grips, top handle, a carrying case and a battery. That&#39;s a lot, of course, but less than some cinema camera systems by themselves — and DJI&#39;s Ronin 2 cinema stabilizer runs $8,000-plus without any camera at all.&nbsp;</p><div id="1008a71d59f445bcb0bd2160262ae7cc"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TiVJnRXUwKw?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/dj-is-8-k-ronin-4-d-camera-has-a-built-in-gimbal-and-li-dar-autofocus-system-165716323.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">415191e2-4cfa-437c-b9a2-792812b7aef3</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 20 Oct 2021 16:57:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1634749984</ingested><modified>2021-10-20T17:13:16+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Earnings]]></category><category><![CDATA[USA News]]></category><category><![CDATA[Budget, Tax & Economy]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/485e6370-31c0-11ec-af5b-4e719049551c" width="2048" height="1256" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/485e6370-31c0-11ec-af5b-4e719049551c" width="2048" height="1256" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DJI]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[DJI's Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[DJI's Ronin 4D cinema camera has a built-in gimbal and LiDAR focus system]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Windows 11 beta users can start testing Android apps]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You finally have a chance to try Android apps in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/windows-11-review-microsoft-mindful-os-200028040.html">Windows 11</a> — provided you&#39;re willing to live on the bleeding edge for a while.
