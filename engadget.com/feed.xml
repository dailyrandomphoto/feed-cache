Facebook does not even consider them a prototype. And they are not, and may never be, available for purchase. Rather, Facebook has always described them as a way for its employees to study and test augmented reality tech.&nbsp;</p><p>Though Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/09/announcing-project-aria-a-research-project-on-the-future-of-wearable-ar/">announcement at the time</a> made clear the company&#39;s intentions, it was light on details about how the glasses would actually work. Now, nearly a year after the initial launch, a series of regulatory documents are giving us a belated first peek inside. In a <a href="https://fccid.io/2AWS6-5646/User-Manual/Users-Manual-5086339.pdf">user manual</a> first reported by <a href="https://www.protocol.com/project-aria-gemini-ar-glasses"><em>Protocol</em></a>, we learn that this specific device goes by the codename Gemini EVT, with EVT being an abbreviation for &quot;engineering valuation test.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As you might expect, given the stated purpose of the device, there is no visual AR component. Meaning, there&#39;s no built-in display for viewing 3D image overlays. Again, the glasses in their early form really do exist just for this small team of engineers to collect data.</p><p>Not that you can buy one but if you could, the glasses would also support prescription lenses, the manual reveals.</p><p>Additionally, the manual indicates there&#39;s a proximity sensor on the inner temple, along with four cameras that can capture both video and still photos. Interestingly, Facebook used the same camera sensors here that it did on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oculus-quest-2-review-vr-facebook-headset-173026291.html">Oculus Quest 2 headset</a>, our review of which we published the same day in September last year that Facebook announced Project Aria. Given the timing, it may just be those sensors were the most readily available to Facebook.</p><p>Also inside is a Qualcomm chipset, with a modified version of Android powering the software experience. Charging happens via a USB cable, which attached magnetically to the glasses.</p><p>The user experience seems simple, as far as we can tell. There are shutter and power buttons, plus a mute switch that &quot;toggles privacy mode on/off.&quot; When a recording is in progress, a series of LEDs help passerby understand that the camera is on. Meanwhile, there&#39;s a companion iOS app called Ariane that handles the basics: device setup, scanning for WiFi networks, showing the battery status and uploading what data the sensors have collected. It&#39;s unclear, however, if there is also an Android version of the app that exists, or is in the works. Again, not that you&#39;d be able to download it either way.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-project-aria-ar-glasses-details-030106045.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6f45a3b4-19b9-45a2-8baa-7dd8f762b306</guid><dc:creator>Dana Wollman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 03:01:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629946881</ingested><modified>2021-08-26T03:01:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Dana Wollman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ac914e10-0610-11ec-9767-caaf0dfe4370" width="675" height="380" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ac914e10-0610-11ec-9767-caaf0dfe4370" width="675" height="380" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook's Project Aria AR glasses.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook's Project Aria AR glasses]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft is killing its Office app on Chromebooks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&#39;re not sure who or how many people use Microsoft Office on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-chromebooks-160054646.html">Chromebook</a> but if that&#39;s you, you&#39;re in for a downgraded experience. Microsoft will soon kill its Office app for Android on Chrome OS, the company <a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/microsoft-ending-chromebook-support-for-office-android-apps-in-september/">confirmed Wednesday to <em>About Chromebooks</em></a>. The app will leave the Google Play Store on September 18th, at which point users will need to sign in through the web via Office.com or Outlook.com.

The company has begun to approach academics and policy experts, who <em>The Times</em> says could potentially weigh in on issues ranging from political ads to election misinformation. What&#39;s more, it is not just US elections where a commission could find itself weighing complicated election issues; the commission would also likely have a mandate to weigh in on closely watched elections in Hungary, Germany, Brazil and the Philippines.</p><p>Facebook declined to comment.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>On its face, the commission sounds a lot like Facebook&#39;s Oversight Board, an independent panel of journalists, academics and activists often described as a &quot;Supreme Court&quot; that&#39;s tasked with reviewing Facebook&#39;s policies. The Oversight Board is perhaps best known for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-decision-trump-suspension-ban-130251901.html">upholding Facebook&#39;s decision to ban Donald Trump</a>, though since <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-members-184214216.html">its formation last year</a> it has also agreed to weigh in on <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-doxing-policy-173350631.html">doxing</a>; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-hate-speech-194501894.html">hate speech</a>; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-newsworthiness-politicians-oversight-board-171141109.html">how politicians at large should be treated</a>; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-myanmar-coup-restore-post-china-164304497.html">content moderation in coup-torn Myanmar</a>; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-notifying-some-users-whose-posts-were-removed-by-automation-212939760.html">moderation by algorithms</a>; and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-satire-exception-community-standards-oversight-board-212257406.html">appropriate treatment of satire content</a>.</p><p>But though the makeup of the election commission sounds like the Oversight Board — and could similarly let Facebook <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-oversight-board-trump-influence-203741183.html">side-step ownership of controversial decisions</a> — there could be an important difference, according to <em>The Times</em>. Whereas the Oversight Board weighs in on decisions that Facebook has already made (much like the Supreme Court considers contested court rulings), the election commission would have the latitude to proactively offer advice, even on matters where Facebook had not yet taken a public stance.</p><p>If Facebook goes ahead with outsourcing election-related decisions to an advisory committee, it would be a departure from its previous attempts to counter election misinformation, which have been largely reactive, and almost always imperfect. Even after a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ban-political-ads-after-polls-close-election-night-215455707.html">temporary ban</a> on political ads ahead of the 2020 US election, some ads were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ad-library-political-ad-ban-151531122.html">still showing as active</a> in Facebook&#39;s ad library. Facebook last year also endeavored to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-politically-connected-ad-policy-191415508.html">label ads from politically connected publications</a>, and earlier this year moved to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-political-content-news-feed-mark-zuckerberg-232846266.html">show users less political content altogether</a>.</p><p>Though Facebook reportedly hopes to launch the commission ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, <em>The Times</em> also describes the outreach as preliminary, with no guarantee that Facebook will move forward on this.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-election-commission-235216693.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">97420698-83dd-40ea-a518-e835d82ece57</guid><dc:creator>Dana Wollman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 23:52:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629935732</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T23:55:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Elections]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Dana Wollman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e19bdfc0-05f8-11ec-b35e-2d681a0d8787" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e19bdfc0-05f8-11ec-b35e-2d681a0d8787" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/08/24: In this photo illustration the Facebook logo seen displayed on a smartphone.

As <em>CNN</em><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/world/yara-birkeland-norway-crewless-container-ship-spc-intl/index.html">reports</a>, Yara International now expects to sail the first autonomous, fully electric cargo ship in Norway by the end of 2021. The Yara Birkeland will travel from Herøya to Brevik with only three remote control centers keeping watch over the journey.</p><p>Yara first developed the concept in 2017 and had planned to set sail in 2020, but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the trip. It&#39;s not the first crewless ship of any kind to venture forth (a Finnish ferry launched in 2018), but it is the first all-electric model.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>It&#39;s a slow vessel with a 13-knot top speed from its two 900kW propulsion systems (container ships typically travel at 16 to 25 knots), and it&#39;s safe to say the giant 7MWh battery will take a while to charge. However, Yara believes it will be worthwhile for the environmental gains. The firm estimated the Yara Birkeland would replace about 40,000 truck trips per year, dramatically reducing CO2 and nitrous oxide emissions in a country that already relies heavily on hydroelectric power. The ship could also alleviate traffic congestion on land, not to mention keep humans out of  danger (albeit at the possible expense of jobs).</p><p>It may still be a long while before you see autonomous cargo haulers making trips elsewhere. Even if range isn&#39;t an issue, docks are — it would be harder for a self-sailing ship to navigate a busy port like Durban or Shanghai. There are also legal issues. Different countries have their own rules for the sea. As with self-driving cars, there&#39;s also the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-12-19-waymo-strikes-deal-to-insure-self-driving-taxi-service.html">matter of liability</a>. Who&#39;s to blame if an autonomous ship runs aground? While it&#39;s easy to see a day when autonomous electric ships are commonplace, that day likely isn&#39;t close at hand.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/yara-birkeland-autonomous-electric-cargo-ship-launch-date-211945689.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0a554dc5-6b42-469f-84ce-70a6d6d58246</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 21:19:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629926965</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T21:29:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Commercial Vehicles]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4511d910-05e5-11ec-bd37-b7ea67bd8077" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4511d910-05e5-11ec-bd37-b7ea67bd8077" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yara International]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Yara Birkeland autonomous electric cargo ship]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Yara Birkeland autonomous electric cargo ship]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sifu's slick kung fu battles arrive on PlayStation and PC February 22nd]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Sifu"><em><ins>Sifu</ins></em></a> has been on our radar for a while, but until now, it hasn&#39;t been clear when exactly we&#39;d get our hands on the kung fu action title.

He added that YouTube removes almost 10 million videos each quarter, “the majority of which don’t even reach 10 views.”</p><p>Facebook recently made a similar argument about content on its platform. The social network published a report last week that claimed that the most popular posts are memes and other <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-widely-viewed-content-170843073.html"><ins>non-political</ins></a> content. And, faced with criticism over its handling of COVID-19 and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-vaccine-misinformation-policies-170012241.html"><ins>vaccine misinformation</ins></a>, the company has argued that vaccine misinformation isn’t representative of the kind of content most users see.</p><p>Both Facebook and YouTube have come under particular scrutiny for their policies around health misinformation during the pandemic. Both platforms have well over a billion users, which means that even a small fraction of content can have a far-reaching impact. And both platforms have so far declined to disclose details about how vaccine and health misinformation spreads or how many users are encountering it. Mahon also said that removing misinformation is only one aspect of the company’s approach. YouTube is also working on “ratcheting up information from trusted sources and reducing the spread of videos with harmful misinformation.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/youtube-covid-19-misinformation-takedowns-201041091.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7d891337-3285-46ce-932f-4f90933639f9</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 20:10:41 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629921949</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T20:06:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b414f570-05d8-11ec-9bf9-59be78420f14" width="4751" height="3167" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b414f570-05d8-11ec-9bf9-59be78420f14" width="4751" height="3167" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The YouTube video app is seen on various digital devices on 28 March, 2017.

Guerilla has released a free Enhanced Performance Patch for the earlier game that gives PS5 players a &quot;targeted&quot; 60FPS. This won&#39;t suddenly drag the game into the next-gen console era, but the improved frame rate should make it that much easier to dodge charging robots and line up bow shots.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/horizon-forbidden-west-release-date-193911645.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d38aaedb-d832-4f22-9853-30e33ed1b628</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:39:11 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629920354</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T19:39:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e7d327a0-05d9-11ec-97fb-18993fcd6f6d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e7d327a0-05d9-11ec-97fb-18993fcd6f6d" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Guerilla]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Aloy in 'Horizon Forbidden West']]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Aloy in 'Horizon Forbidden West']]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Portal shooter 'Splitgate' launches Season 0, a bigger, better beta]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.splitgate.com/"><em>Splitgate</em></a><em>, </em>an FPS that combines the best of classic Quake multiplayer and <em>Portal</em>, is an unlikely shooter success story. It reached an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-10-million-downloads-100924991.html">astounding 10 million downloads </a>during its open beta last month, when it made its way to consoles and unveiled cross-platform play. And to celebrate that success, today developer 1047 Games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-10-million-downloads-100924991.html">launched its next beta phase</a>: Season 0.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;In the span of a month, our servers went from supporting 4,000 players at once to 175,000 players!&quot; <em>Splitgate </em>creator and 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx wrote on the PlayStation blog. &quot;All in all, our servers had some growing pains, so we had to implement short-term solutions to prevent back-end crashes.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7d8355b3defe486dbb30122f5ee506f3"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5XKcTM_NM8?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Given the influx of new users, Proulx says he chose to delay the game&#39;s official launch and extend the beta phase. Existing players can expect a slew of new content in Season 0, including Karman Station, a new map, as well as a new Infection gameplay mode. There&#39;s also a Season 0 Battle Pass and plenty of new gear to pick up. They have to support a free-to-play game somehow, right?&nbsp;</p><p>After spending more than 10 hours in the previous <em>Splitgate</em> beta, it&#39;s easy to see why the game has caught on so quickly. It combines solid shooter mechanics with something entirely new: The ability to place portals around the map, which you can use to teleport or take out enemies. If anything, it&#39;s a welcome respite from the flood of Battle Royale titles on the market.&nbsp;</p><p>While <em>Splitgate</em> doesn&#39;t have an official launch date yet, the beta is pretty stable in my experience. Proulx says 1047 Games is also work on a map editor, as well as additional maps, weapons and other items in the future.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/splitgate-season-0-beta-launch-193849912.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">51b65339-73b8-4ffa-a32e-fdf23c158624</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:38:49 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629920373</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T19:39:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/42c24f50-05db-11ec-bbff-3267338bd3bf" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/42c24f50-05db-11ec-bbff-3267338bd3bf" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Portal shooter &#39;Splitgate&#39; launches Season 0, a bigger, better beta]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga' will arrive in spring 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We haven&#39;t heard much about <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em> since TT Games <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lego-star-wars-skywalker-saga-delayed-indefinitely-162934202.html">delayed it indefinitely</a> back in April.

XCOM developer Firaxis has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz8Vw5tOf5M">unveiled</a><em>Marvel&#39;s Midnight Suns</em>, a turn-based role-playing game based on the Midnight Sons team from 1990s crossover issues. The modern take has you play a new Marvel co-created superhero, The Hunter, as she fights the Mother of Demons, Lilith. Your character will have help from Midnight Sons members like Blade, Ghost Rider and Wolverine as well as Avengers mainstays like Captain America and Iron Man.</p><p>The title reaches PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch and Windows PCs in March 2022. A gameplay presentation is due on September 1st.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>In case you&#39;re wondering: no, this won&#39;t just be an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2-k-marvel-xcom-borderlands-spinoff-141527233.html">XCOM game with capes</a>. Game lead Jake Solomon told <em>Polygon</em> in an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22641096/marvels-midnight-suns-is-the-next-game-from-the-xcom-team">interview</a> that <em>Midnight Suns</em> shares &quot;zero mechanics&quot; with the XCOM series. You&#39;ll play missions with up to three other heroes as you develop The Hunter&#39;s powers. When you&#39;re not in combat, an open-world area will help you form bonds with fellow heroes. And instead of the paranoia and fear that drive XCOM, you&#39;re rolling into battle with confidence — there&#39;s no permanent character death, for starters.</p><p>This is something of a gamble when many Marvel appearances have involved more conventional brawlers and fighting games. Firaxis has a strong track record, however, and dipping into the Midnight Sons catalog draw in both long-time Marvel fans as well as those who don&#39;t want to rehash the brand&#39;s most familiar stories.</p><div id="a32014456cdc4f7faf5a27abdc444838"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wz8Vw5tOf5M?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvels-midnight-suns-release-date-trailer-191236120.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6392f10-b089-45cf-bbb2-2f01e98a9acf</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 19:12:36 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629918775</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T19:13:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2772f8c0-05d2-11ec-9f3f-dd0b89da79f8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2772f8c0-05d2-11ec-9f3f-dd0b89da79f8" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Firaxis Games/2K]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Marvel's Midnight Suns' from Firaxis]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Marvel's Midnight Suns' from Firaxis]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Special-edition 'Halo Infinite' Xbox Series X and controller arrive on November 15th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/halo-infinite-december-8th-launch-date-134031534.html"><em>Halo Infinite </em>release date</a>, Microsoft made a couple of other Halo-related announcements at <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-how-to-watch-geoff-keighley-152019558.html">Gamescom&#39;s Opening Night Live event</a>.

In its place is<em> Saints Row</em>, a reboot of the series with a back-to-basics focus on ground-level crime and violence. In the seven years since <em>Gat out of Hell</em> was released (we’re not counting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agents_of_Mayhem"><em>Agents of Mayhem</em></a>), the world has moved on, and so too must <em>Saints Row</em>.</p><h3><strong>Welcome to the Weird West</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/32a73e80-05ba-11ec-baff-fc981a5d30ae" alt="Image from Saints Row (2022)" data-uuid="ca96d74e-accd-3240-b6cb-51ae30f05a20"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>The new game is called Saints Row (which we&#39;re told has no subtitle, despite the repeated use of the &quot;Self Made&quot; tagline even on the box art), and is set in Santo Ileso (Spanish speakers, does that pun work for you?), a stand in for America’s Four Corners region which the developers are calling the “weird west.” There are Route 66 signs scattered across the landscape and the desert that surrounds the city, with its patchy grass and tall mesas, looks a lot like Arizona. The neon-strewn casino district (El Dorado) seems to be inspired by those found in Albuquerque. And the financial area, at least from the trailers (and to my British eyes) seems to have been pulled from downtown Santa Fe.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Santo Ileso is made up of nine individual districts with each one designed to use a different traversal method. Running and driving will work best in some regions, while players are encouraged to fly a wingsuit off the top of the financial district’s skyscrapers to cover long distances. Or you can steal a VTOL-equipped craft and just make merry havoc all over the city as you go. The game was built in a brand new, as-yet unannounced engine and these new environments are designed to take advantage of the power that next-gen consoles — if we can still call them that — can offer.</p><p>The developers say that <em>Saints Row’s</em> focus is, at least early in the game, going to focus on the material concerns of its young crew. These disaffected millennials turn to crime to, for instance, put food on their table, feel part of a community and pay off their student loans. Chief creative officer Jim Boone says that it’s, broadly, a “contemporary” millennial “power fantasy.” It’s only later that the game’s focus switches to the sort of empire-building that, in the previous series, eventually saw your character <em>becoming president</em>.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/485eac30-05bb-11ec-bfdf-20830d57473c" alt="Cover art for Saints Row (2022)" data-uuid="5b2b708f-2827-3cd4-a906-44321341455f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>As the game progresses, players can buy property and businesses which opens up new game modes and levels. You can choose where to put those businesses, too, like putting a garbage collection site in the middle of the financial district. The choices you make here will, for instance, engender resistance if you start putting toxic waste next to wherever the one percenters live and work. And, as you take over more of the city, the bigger your power base will grow.</p><p>The storyline sees your ragtag quartet encounter three distinct gangs, each of which owns a chunk of Santo Ileso. The Panteros, for instance, are a bunch of muscle-car enthusiasts who try to use their superior strength to defeat you in combat. Marshall Defense Industries, meanwhile, is a local weapons developer with its own mercenary army equipped with a range of sci-fi weapons and superior marksmanship. Then there are the Idols, a group of Kawaii Cyberpunk Anarchists wearing light-up cat ear helmets who overwhelm you with numbers in a fight.</p><h3><strong>Meet the new boss</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/89d72630-05b9-11ec-bfb4-fcbcdb6e022e" alt="Images of the Saints Row cast" data-uuid="92355e48-326b-3052-ad3b-9c6ec26e7265"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>As far as we know, references to Steelport, the 3rd Street Saints, Johnny Gat, Kenzie and anything else from the prior series are gone. Or, at least, will be relegated to the odd, deeply buried easter egg for die-hard fans to root out while they’re immersed in this new world. In their place is a trio of characters that work to support your player’s unnamed and customizable protagonist.</p><p>There’s Eli (pictured, 2nd from right), an MBA student who works as the team’s planner, speaking in the language of startups, investment and business. Then there’s Neenah (pictured, right), the team’s driver, who had aspirations of becoming an anthropologist but got sucked into working as a mechanic for Los Panteros. Rounding out the quartet (of which you are the fourth member) is Kevin (pictured, left), a topless thrill-seeking DJ who, like his fellow Idols, loves wearing a Kawaii Cyberpunk helmet and wreaking havoc.</p><p>The player character is, as before, infinitely customizable — although it’s not clear how broad those options are. Deep Silver says that you’ll have access to the “most advanced suite” of customization tools ever seen in an open-world game.</p><p>One of the questions raised in the roundtable with the game’s developers was that of cultural appropriation. The six people made available for interview were all middle-aged white men, creating a game set in a region where a significant proportion of the population is Latinx or Hispanic. Creative director Jim Boone said that diversity was important, and there was an explicit focus on making the team producing the game as diverse as the characters in it.</p><h3><strong>Inspiration</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/587066a0-05ba-11ec-bfed-4bb40da54c18" alt="Images taken from promotional material for &#39;Saints Row&#39; (2022)" data-uuid="8d94ecf7-6fdc-3074-bed5-34db4561a49b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>In terms of what we can expect from the new title, Boone said that some of the major inspirations for this film came from the cinema. He cited three titles: <em>John Wick</em>, <em>Baby Driver </em>and <em>Fast and Furious Presents: Hobbes and Shaw </em>as key influences. From the first, you will be able to spot some of the brutality in the combat and some of the melee takedown moves are cribbed from the film’s action sequences. The experience of driving has been pulled from the second, while the third’s penchant for over-the-top action helped provide a baseline for how stunts would work in the new game.</p><p>There will also be a broad degree of <em>Fast and Furious</em>-inspired vehicle customization in which every playable ride can be fixed up. The desert that surrounds Santo Ileso, for instance, has plenty of rough terrain that can be used to crest dunes and chase or evade your enemies. Consequently, players can even jury-rig the game’s garbage truck as a heavy-duty off-road vehicle.</p><h3><strong>Playing together</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/586a9a40-05ba-11ec-bf25-74a1c784a30f" alt="Images taken from promotional material for &#39;Saints Row&#39; (2022)" data-uuid="fa623bcf-3d81-3e1c-bd6c-8522f7861133"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>Saints Row is coming to the PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox One and, for PC gamers, the Epic Games Store. The developers said that cross-platform co-op will be available from the start, and you can play the entire campaign through “untethered co-op play.” One thing that was mentioned was the ability to “prank” your co-op partner, stymying their progress in order to advance your own.</p><h3><strong>The elephant in the room</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/58968c40-05ba-11ec-9bdf-8b76406855fe" alt="Images taken from promotional material for &#39;Saints Row&#39; (2022)" data-uuid="9b78a593-3cd0-3bbf-991b-495764b67891"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>There are more than a few reasons why Volition chose to make <em>Saints Row</em>, rather than <em>Saints Row V</em>. Boone said that the classic series of games were very much “of [their] time,” with tastes and attitudes having moved on. And it can’t have helped that the company’s last attempt at a reboot,<em> Agents of Mayhem</em>, received lukewarm reviews and poor sales, forcing Volition to make layoffs in its wake.</p><p>Lead mission designer Jeremy Bernstein added that the original story, by the end of <em>Gat out of Hell</em>, had burned through all of its narrative runway. When your player protagonist has conquered Earth, ascended to Godhood and escaped hell, there’s not much you can do to top it. Bernstein compared the problem to the James Bond movies circa <em>Moonraker,</em> saying that once you’ve done <em>James Bond In Space</em>, the gritty realism of <em>For Your Eyes Only</em> is one hell of a tonal shift.</p><h3><strong>But is it still fun?</strong></h3><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/5893cd20-05ba-11ec-90bb-553c5c64ecfb" alt="Images taken from promotional material for &#39;Saints Row&#39; (2022)" data-uuid="f5f299f0-caee-3fa7-bdcd-6c1cedc4be12"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Deep Silver / Volition</div></figure><p>The team wanted to assure us that while the juvenilia that marked the previous series was gone, the irreverence would remain. Bernstein said that it would be pretty much impossible to make a “grimdark Saints Row game” for obvious reasons. And while the developers didn’t elaborate much on silly weapons, like the Penetrator (<em>Saints Row The Third’s</em> infamous Dildo Lance) and the Dubstep Gun (from <em>Saints Row IV</em>), they said one or two had made their way into the title. You’ll also, once again, be able to ragdoll yourself into traffic under the auspices of committing insurance fraud.</p><p>If I have a concern, it’s that I always found Saints Row a more enjoyable franchise than<em> GTA</em> because of the emphasis on fun. The challenges soon became repetitive, but the breadth of ways in which you could complete a mission (and the fun weapons) helped smooth the edges. The emphasis here, so far, has been on the difference between the new game and its predecessors, with less discussion on how fun it all is. Maybe that’s just savvy marketing, and the new title will be just as fun and silly as franchise diehards are hoping. But it’s something that I’d like to see more of, or else I’d get the feeling that the title may lose the one thing people are so desperate for it to have.</p><p><em>Saints Row</em> is scheduled to launch on February 25th, 2022 for current and next-generation consoles.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/saints-row-reboot-2022-200040315.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">38a3152e-137f-4198-a5af-bc3ed1ab9596</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 18:06:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629914776</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T18:06:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fe5d78b0-05b9-11ec-a9d8-7a1bc4f38fb4" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fe5d78b0-05b9-11ec-a9d8-7a1bc4f38fb4" width="1800" height="1013" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Deep Silver / Volition]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of combat taken from Saints Row (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Saints Row' (2022) Combat ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Marvel’s ‘What If…?’ turns grim in its third episode with mixed results]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post contains major spoilers for episode three of What If…?</em></p><p>After two fun, zippy stories that focused on the idea of swapping one character for another, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/what%20if"><em>What If…?</em></a> pivots to a darker outcome in its third installment. This time, the entire Avengers slate is wiped clean, with Nick Fury left to sort out the mess. It’s a nod to the animated series’ comic inspiration, plus a sign that the show isn’t willing to settle into a routine.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The original comic book, also called <em>What If?</em>, often see-sawed between silly and serious scenarios, like what would happen if Spider-Man had joined the Fantastic Four, Gwen Stacy had lived or if Dazzler became Galactus’ herald. With no need to follow continuity, the creative teams of each issue in the anthology were free to take the story wherever they wanted, often in dark turns that ultimately illustrated why the original timeline was the best.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ce9a9ff0-05cc-11ec-bbff-5bf0580484cf" alt="Marvel&#39;s What If?" data-uuid="820e02b6-31a2-38ca-bf87-f77038f9e091"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>However, the <em>What If…?</em><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Disney+;elmt:impact radius;pdid:Disney+" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/P0ab6Y">Disney+</a> series has taken the opposite tack, showcasing one scenario where things are largely the same level of good and bad (for Captain Carter) and another where events went decidedly better (unless you’re Peter Quill). It’s likely the creators didn’t want to immediately scare away casual viewers with anything too grim, keeping the stories as light and breezy as their cinematic inspirations.</p><p>The third episode doesn’t just change this course by featuring a more pessimistic scenario, however, it also steps away from telling us upfront why things are like this. The first two episodes had Uatu explicitly pointing out the moment of divergence. This time around, we know something is different — the prospective Avengers are being murdered — but exactly how and why is a mystery.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/94fb6610-facf-11eb-9fff-ce21547852b7" alt="The Watcher" data-uuid="bf0431ba-f891-3cc4-8f70-433799625d62"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Marvel Studios</div></figure><p>It actually makes for a more interesting show because rather than playing a half-hour game of “spot the difference,” we become engaged in speculation about why this is happening. We know things would be vastly altered if Tony Stark or Bruce Banner dies, but now we get to play detective, plumbing our knowledge of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for suspects and motives. Instead of a straight-up adventure tale, this episode was a murder mystery.</p><p>Whether it’s a <em>successful</em> mystery, I’m not entirely sure. Hank Pym is not someone I had considered as a suspect, even with his distaste for SHIELD and the Starks in the main timeline. The point of divergence turns out to be Hope Pym joining SHIELD and being killed on a mission, which leaves Hank alone and bitter. Why he chooses to kill five uninvolved strangers in an attempt to hurt Nick Fury is murky at best. I’d originally pegged the murder of the Avengers as a Hydra plot, which would have actually help shore up the retcon from <em>Captain America and the Winter Soldier</em> of SHIELD being taken over by Hydra — it’s rarely explored why Hydra let the Avengers get as far as they did in the main timeline, rather than strangling that potential opposition in its cradle.</p><div id="ed0e84c664ad4df39cf088d0e8ba58e6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wzjQsZ_Wr50?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Ultimately, the point of the episode is to set the viewer up for even darker stories to come — at least one future story is focused on zombies, a nod to the rather successful line of “Marvel Zombies” comics from over a decade ago. It also does some tidying up for the main continuity as well, reminding the viewers that three of the early <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/marvel%20cinematic%20universe">MCU</a> films took place in the same week, and that Loki is <em>still</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/loki-disney-plus-premiere-review-160028040.html">a jerk</a>. It may not be <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-disney-plus-animated-episode-one-183034023.html">essential viewing</a>, but <em>What If…?</em> is certainly a useful footnote.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/marvel-what-if-episode-three-avengers-disney-plus-175935938.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">250066a9-8011-4a26-b5c9-e5200a5cfad3</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 18:00:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629914295</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T17:58:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cartoons & Comics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/e6bea830-05ca-11ec-bcd9-84dfcbee9651" width="3840" height="1748" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/ef477e30-05cc-11ec-b7bf-8cba632c1e4c" width="3041" height="1748" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Marvel Studios]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nick Fury and Hawkeye]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Marvel's What If...?]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Google brings Smart Replies to comments in Docs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google"><ins>Google</ins></a> is bringing its handy Smart Replies to Google Docs comments <a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/08/save-time-replying-to-comments-in.html"><ins>in the coming days</ins></a>.

The rapper and electronics design firm <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kano-pc-windows-10-build-yourself-computer-education-review-153033789.html">Kano</a> have <a href="https://www.stemplayer.com/">introduced</a> a Donda Stem Player that, as the name implies, lets you remix music from Kanye&#39;s upcoming album <em>Donda</em> (plus your own tunes) using <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-08-03-native-instruments-stems-format-available-now.html">song stems</a>.</p><p>The puck-like gadget reportedly lets you isolate song parts and control aspects like bass, drums, samples and vocals. You can reportedly split &quot;any&quot; song into stems. We&#39;ve asked Kano how this works, but it&#39;s unlikely that it will perfectly separate song elements — that&#39;s a difficult feat for a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/djay-pro-ai-machine-learning-neural-mix-isolate-audio-elements-on-the-fly-130014409.html">full-fledged PC</a>, let alone something as portable as this.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Stem Player also includes familiar tools including effects, four-channel audio mixing, live sampling and real-time loop and speed controls. You navigate much of the interface through four touch-sensitive &quot;light sliders&quot; with haptic feedback and customizable colors, and you can save and share your creations with othrs.</p><p>You can pipe audio through the built-in speaker, Bluetooth or a 3.5mm headphone jack through a variety of lossy and lossless formats (including AAC, AIFF, MP3 and WAV). You&#39;ll have just 8GB of storage to work with, though — minus the bundled <em>Donda</em> stems.</p><p>You can order the Stem Player now for $200. That&#39;s not a trivial outlay if you&#39;re eager to tinker with songs, but it&#39;s relatively affordable as far as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/circuit-rhythm-is-a-portable-400-sampler-for-budding-beatmakers-150001845.html">electronic music-making devices</a> go. Just be aware that it&#39;s really just one part of a larger creative toolset, not your ticket to stardom.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kanye-west-donda-stem-player-164315448.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">faa47073-9064-4a62-96f1-c287f955b6a1</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 25 Aug 2021 16:43:15 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629913516</ingested><modified>2021-08-25T17:45:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Music]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Celebrities]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/484c00d0-05b6-11ec-b3bf-06051b9785fb" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/484c00d0-05b6-11ec-b3bf-06051b9785fb" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Kanye West]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Kanye West Donda Stem Player]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Kanye West Donda Stem Player]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[South Korea to end its controversial gaming curfew]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Gamers under 16 in South Korea have a reason to celebrate today: The country plans to end its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2011-11-23-south-korea-puts-the-cinderella-law-into-effect.html">shutdown law </a>(AKA the Cinderella Law), which prevented underage players from gaming between midnight and 6AM, the <a href="http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20210825000854"><em>Korea Herald reports</em></a>.

Instead, excessive gaming will be managed by the country&#39;s &quot;choice permit&quot; system, which lets parents and guardians arrange approved play times.
