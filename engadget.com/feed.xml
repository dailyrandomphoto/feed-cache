You may recall back in 2010 Funny Or Die released a trailer for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcNuiri2dV0&amp;ab_channel=FunnyOrDie"><em>Weird: The Al Yankovic Story</em></a>. The clip promised an unflinching look at Yankovic‚Äôs life with performances from actors like Aaron Paul, Olvia Wilde and Gary Cole. We‚Äôre not about to get that film (sadly), but Roku may just give us the next best thing.</p><div id="7f77a8b1ace84ceb8ba379f86c7c9c41"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vcNuiri2dV0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The company announced today it‚Äôs backing production on <em>WEIRD: The Weird Al Jankovic Story</em>. Instead of Aaron Paul as Yankovic, we get Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe. Eric Appel, best known for his work on <em>Silicon Valley</em> and <em>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</em>, co-wrote the film‚Äôs script alongside Yankovic and is directing the project. If Appel‚Äôs name sounds familiar, it‚Äôs because he directed the 2010 trailer for <em>Weird: The Al Yankovic Story</em>.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>‚ÄúI am absolutely thrilled that Daniel Radcliffe will be portraying me in the film,‚Äù Yankovic said in a statement. ‚ÄúI have no doubt whatsoever that this is the role future generations will remember him for.‚Äù <em>WEIRD: The Weird Al Yankovic Story </em>doesn‚Äôt have a release date yet, but production on the film is slated to start next month.

To begin with, the developer <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-battle-royale-v19-10-update-battle-atop-tilted-towers-and-klombos">has added</a> decidedly Toothless-like climbable monsters (Klombos) that traverse the map. You can use the blowholes on their heads to fly away from pursuing rivals, and feed them fruit (Klomberries) to get items. They&#39;re normally peaceful, but can be provoked into a frenzy.</p><p>The latest update also revives <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-04-fortnite-event-destroys-tilted-towers.html">Tilted Towers</a>, arguably <em>Fortnite</em>&#39;s best-known location. While there appear to be some cosmetic changes, you&#39;ll have the chance to revisit the sniper-friendly clock tower, scour restaurants for items and otherwise take a nostalgia trip. While we&#39;d expect this to be a hot drop zone for at least a little while (i.e. don&#39;t expect to last long), it might be worth a visit to see an iconic area that hasn&#39;t been available for two years.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Whatever your travel plans, you&#39;ll want to be aware of a couple of smaller gameplay-related updates. The grenade launcher has returned with more direct firing and rounds that explode after their first bounce. And if you&#39;re skilled enough to earn more than 99 Crowned Victory Royales, the matching Crowning Achievement emote now displays that number. Your bragging rights remain intact, and you might just have the weapon needed to back them up.</p><div id="7d508b053c5d4d04b32d24972ec6ce4e"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Where we droppin‚Äô? üëÄ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DropOnTilted?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DropOnTilted</a><a href="https://t.co/G2NB5ot5Bd">pic.twitter.com/G2NB5ot5Bd</a></p>‚Äî Fortnite (@FortniteGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1483397786196492290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 18, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/fortnite-dinosaurs-titled-towers-chapter-3-143304605.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d224222b-717b-4d82-939f-6f6a97861905</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 14:33:04 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642516386</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T14:33:18+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/69338e30-7861-11ec-9fff-d0dece304316" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/69338e30-7861-11ec-9fff-d0dece304316" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Epic Games]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Klombo dinosaur in 'Fortnite' Chapter 3]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Klombo dinosaur in 'Fortnite' Chapter 3]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Weber's 2022 smart grill lineup includes gas and pellet options]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-grilling-gear-143011296.html">Grilling season</a> will be here before you know it, so one of the biggest names in backyard cooking is tipping its hand for spring. Today, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Weber" href="https://fave.co/3AdJl2S">Weber</a> announced it&#39;s 2022 lineup of smart grills with options for cooks who prefer gas or pellet-burning options. No matter the fuel source, all of the new models teased here are equipped with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-24-weber-smokefire-weber-connect-behind-the-scenes.html">the company&#39;s WiFi-enabled Weber Connect technology</a>. With it, you can control and monitor your grill from your phone, keeping tabs on the cooking process while you work on side dishes or relax with guests.&nbsp;</p><p>Weber Connect was first available on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-04-03-weber-connect-smart-grilling-hub-review.html">Smart Grilling Hub</a>, but its big debut came on the first-gen <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-smokefire-review-wifi-pellet-grill-140000499.html">SmokeFire pellet grills</a>. The technology not only provides recipes, but it also guides you through the entire cooking process on a step-by-step basis, from how to prepare meat to when to flip and how long to rest before slicing. In a bid to outsmart the competition, the app also provides <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-june-acquisition-weber-connect-june-oven-200000677.html">estimated doneness times</a> so you&#39;re not left guessing when that brisket will finally hit 205 degrees Fahrenheit. In 2021, the company brought the technology <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-connect-smart-gas-grills-171237945.html">to its Genesis line</a> of gas grills, offering the same convenience as SmokeFire with a more commonly used fuel source ‚Äî plus the ability to monitor your propane tank level.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For 2022, Weber is taking convenience a step further with a range of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:new Genesis gas grills" href="https://fave.co/3Kpj0Dm">new Genesis gas grills</a> and a new version of <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:SmokeFire" href="https://fave.co/3BvlURV">SmokeFire</a>. First, the Genesis lineup of smart grills still feature Weber Connect on top of PureBlu high-heat burners, sear zone, side table, expandable top cooking grate and &quot;Nightvision.&quot; As the name implies that last item allows you to see the grilling surface after dark, with motion-sensing LEDs that can illuminate the entire cooking area when you open the lid ‚Äî including the side tables/burner. The lights are on the reverse side of the handle, with a power button on outside to turn them completely off. Weber says the new Genesis models will come in both three- and four-burner options as well as models with porcelain-enamel or stainless steel finishes.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/6a44e250-780d-11ec-bf46-1422841f989a" alt="Weber SmokeFire Stealth Edition" data-uuid="00d2ab58-5ce6-3b65-9b7d-ffcdf08deb8f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Weber</div></figure><p>For the SmokeFire pellet grill this year, Weber is going all black. Dubbed <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:the Stealth Edition" href="https://fave.co/3qFuD1u">the Stealth Edition</a>, the black-on-black color scheme nixes the silver accents from the original along the sides of the lid, the side shelf and the handles. Weber Connect is still on board, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/weber-smokefire-grills-update-smokeboost-remote-control-firmware-173014646.html">helping you with everything</a> from high heat searing to low-and-slow smoking. The overall design is the same, except for the addition of an interior light for better visibility. As someone who has used a SmokeFire grill before sunrise and after dark, some built-in illumination is a welcome change.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside the grills, Weber is also introducing new accessories it&#39;s calling Weber Crafted. The collection of tools includes a dual-sided sear grate, flat-top griddle, baking stone (for pizza, etc), roasting basket, wok/steamer combo and rotisserie skewers. Special grates and an insert allow you to swap out the accessories on charcoal, gas or pellet grills. The company explains that these add-ons let you steam, bake, roast and more, and you can do so on the grill rather than having to venture inside. Plus, the new Genesis grills have a compartment and hooks for storing the new goods. No word on pricing yet, but each item will be sold separately when they arrive this spring.</p><p>The new Genesis models and the Stealth Edition of SmokeFire will also go on sale this spring. The former will range from $1,049-$2,149 while the latter is $1,399.&nbsp;</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f73de9e4-bb7c-4a09-98f7-906f9443ec55"/><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/weber-2022-grill-lineup-genesis-smokefire-weber-connect-140518150.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8cca6166-75dc-47eb-83f6-15c5ecc79288</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 14:05:18 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642516021</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T14:27:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e9f511c0-77de-11ec-bcf9-6967b1378f23" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e9f511c0-77de-11ec-bcf9-6967b1378f23" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Weber]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Weber Genesis (2022)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Weber Genesis (2022)]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['OlliOlli World' is a friendly but deceptively difficult skateboarding game]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>OlliOlli</em> and its sequel, <em>OlliOlli 2: Welcome to Olliwood</em>, are notoriously difficult to master. These side-scrolling skateboarding games start out easily enough, but if you want to complete every challenge, get ready to play and replay some levels dozens of times over. It can be infuriating, but also extremely satisfying to pull off just the right combo of tricks and grinds needed for a big score.</p><p>I was worried that <em>OlliOlli World</em>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/olliolli-world-preview-interview-e3-160000184.html">a new direction</a> for the series that arrives on February 8th, was going to dispense with that level of challenge. After playing an extended preview of the game over the last week, I‚Äôm no longer concerned. Developer Roll7 has made a game that‚Äôs significantly more approachable than the original titles ‚Äî but one that keeps the twitch-response gameplay and score-chasing highs intact for those who crave them.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>For the uninitiated, <em>OlliOlli World</em> is a, 2.5D skateboarding platformer where your character simply has to make it from one end of the course to the other while pulling off as many tricks and combos as possible. That‚Äôs the same basic formula as the original games, but the scope of <em>OlliOlli World</em> is <em>much</em> greater. The game is split into five different areas, three of which were playable in my demo. The first one, Sunshine Valley, had close to 20 distinct levels, a handful of which were merely training levels meant to introduce the basics of skating, grinding and pulling off different tricks. But even if you don‚Äôt count those levels, there‚Äôs far more to explore in <em>OlliOlli World</em> than the two earlier games, each of which had 50 levels total.</p><div id="43869159fd444fe4921a1db0047a9532"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KEFe58V7FtU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>There‚Äôs a host of ways to challenge yourself as you skate through these levels. For starters, you need to navigate grind rails, gaps, ramps and other obstacles to get to the end before you can progress. In a concession to the game‚Äôs history of bruising difficulty, though, levels now have checkpoints ‚Äî so if you blow it 90 percent of the way through the level, you can try that last segment again. Of course, if you had a huge combo going that got interrupted, you‚Äôll lose out on that opportunity for big points. But this at least makes it easier to learn levels and work on problem spots without having to tackle the entire course again.</p><p>But the levels are both extremely well designed and visually interesting, so I was eager to play and replay them until I mastered all the challenges and found as many secrets as I possibly could. The world is populated with colorful and fantastical creatures like walking bananas, smiling trees, giant bees holding signs for you to wall ride on, huge frogs (sometimes riding those giant bees) and, of course, the Skate Godz that you meet at the end of each world.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d66d8e40-762e-11ec-bbee-489618b599b3" alt="OlliOlli World" data-uuid="1f04f36d-62ac-3c95-8c0d-7e24d8ace70b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roll7</div></figure><p>See, your character is on a quest to become the new Skate Wizard, with the help of a goofy and delightful animated crew, including Chiffon, the one-eyed, pipe-smoking current Skate Wizard who‚Äôs ready to retire. To take their place, you‚Äôll need to meet all of the Skate Godz that inhabit the five different zones you can play through. Each level has some banter with your crew as well as people you meet on your journeys, full of ridiculous puns and occasional advice on how to improve your scores or pull off new moves. You can skip it if you want, but it helped me get in the headspace of the gorgeous world of Radlandia.</p><p>It‚Äôs hard to sum up in words what makes the individual levels in <em>OlliOlli World</em> so compelling, but they mix serious challenge in with moments that let you really get into that elusive flow state, where you‚Äôre just pulling off tricks, riding rails and generally tearing through a course without thinking too much about what you‚Äôre doing. The music, sound effects, art style, level design and variety of moves you can pull off all contribute to this vibe ‚Äî and even though the game looks entirely different from its predecessors, the end result is the same: skateboarding bliss.</p><p>My skills from the original OlliOlli games translated here, but there are plenty of new things to challenge long-time players. The game isn‚Äôt straight 2D anymore, which means there are multiple paths you can discover through many levels, something that seriously adds to replayability and challenge of these levels. Each level has multiple goals you‚Äôre presented with at the beginning, and meeting them all will almost certainly require multiple plays, especially as the game goes on and the tracks get more complex.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, by the time I got about halfway through the third world in the game, I was seriously struggling to check off all of a level&#39;s goals. The good news is you can keep progressing without beating all three challenges, nor are you penalized for using checkpoints, but the game is so well designed that I wanted to keep going back and trying to best my earlier scores and nail those goals.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f196ae40-762e-11ec-bef7-05d7de864641" alt="OlliOlli World" data-uuid="ea7da2f6-d3fe-3f01-83e1-8106dfeb7d41"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roll7</div></figure><p>There are plenty of new moves like grabs to pull off, and quarter-pipes let you change the direction your skater is going in. It sounds simple, but having your skater go right-to-left instead of the opposite really threw me for a loop, but I also audibly cheered the first time I skated into one of those quarter-pipes. They add a whole new dimension to the game that I wasn‚Äôt expecting.</p><p>It‚Äôs also worth mentioning some of the other ways Roll7 made this game more approachable than the earlier ones. Besides the aforementioned checkpoints, it‚Äôs a lot harder to wipe out now. Earlier games required you to press a button when landing, or else you‚Äôd lose all your momentum as well as the points you accumulated from a trick. Now, you can land without having to worry about that step ‚Äî but pulling off so-called ‚Äúperfect‚Äù landings increases your speed and score.</p><p>The main game is a deep experience, but Roll7 added new features for those who love to chase high scores. Every time you finish a level, you‚Äôll see a rival player‚Äôs score that you‚Äôre then challenged to best. It‚Äôs subtle, just showing your rival‚Äôs high score beneath your best score ‚Äî but these challenges taunted me into playing a few extra rounds to try and beat that challenge. <em>OlliOlli World</em> is smart enough to match you with players of your own skill level, so if your high score tops out at 100,000, you won‚Äôt be challenged to beat someone who got 1 million on a level; the rival scores are usually around 20 percent higher than your own best. It‚Äôs good encouragement to push yourself even harder through a level.</p><p><em>OlliOlli World </em>also offers daily challenges through the Gnarvana League, which you unlock once you finish the game‚Äôs first area. Here, you join a league where you‚Äôre pitted against nine competitors who again skate at a similar skill level to you. The levels change every day, and you‚Äôre simply trying to put up the best score in your group. As you play, you can get promoted to other leagues, where the courses presumably will get trickier. I‚Äôll readily admit that after putting up a score that put me on top of my group, I kept my eyes on the league throughout the day to see if I‚Äôd have to replay it and improve my score to keep that top spot.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1a761710-762f-11ec-bbff-e2e55e579a14" alt="OlliOlli World" data-uuid="455d3edf-3e85-3f04-ba1f-f41dc044ddb0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Roll7</div></figure><p>Finally, there‚Äôs a random level generator that you can use to challenge your friends or strangers to put up their best score. The Gnarvana Portal is extremely simple, letting you pick a level‚Äôs ‚Äústyle,‚Äù which is based on the five main worlds in the game. You can then choose one of four difficulty levels and set the course‚Äôs length. Once it‚Äôs generated, you can share that course via an eight-digit postcode. That code lets anyone else try your level, regardless of what platform they‚Äôre playing on, and you again compete to see who can put up the highest score. The fun thing is that anyone can try this, so you can give the postcode to a few close friends, or post it online and challenge anyone you want.</p><p>For the first time in an OlliOlli game, you can also customize your character to your heart&#39;s content. There are a ton of clothing options, hairstyles, skateboard designs, skin color options and much more here, and you&#39;ll unlock much more as you check off the different challenges each level offers. Unlike the first two games&#39; single, generic male skater design, you can make a character here that truly fits your personality.</p><p>There‚Äôs a ton of game here for $30, and the Roll7 team has at least two DLC expansions planned for later this year (both of which are included if you order the $45 Rad Edition). If you have even a passing interest in skateboarding or platformer games, <em>OlliOlli World</em> is absolutely worth your time. It‚Äôs deeper, brighter, bigger and more fun than the original games, and I expect it‚Äôll be a hit with hardcore OlliOllli fanatics as well as a much bigger new audience experiencing the thrill of this meditative skating series for the first time.</p><p>OlliOlli World<em> will be available on the Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One and PC on February 8th.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/olliolli-world-gameplay-preview-140021521.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c86434b8-e865-4a22-81e0-a4ed28ca29c3</guid><dc:creator>Nathan Ingraham</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 14:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642513887</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T13:51:47+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Nathan Ingraham]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/920846d0-762b-11ec-9faf-98c7f7758bc6" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/920846d0-762b-11ec-9faf-98c7f7758bc6" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Roll7]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[OlliOlli World]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[OlliOlli World]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft is buying Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft just made one of the largest-ever bids for a game studio. The company has <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/14/__trashed/">announced</a> plans to acquire Activision Blizzard for $95 per share, valuing the all-cash deal at an enormous $68.7 billion. The deal would make the combined entity the &quot;third-largest&quot; game company by revenue, according to Microsoft, and would put titles like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Candy Crush</em> under the company&#39;s wing. Microsoft plans to add Activision Blizzard games to Game Pass as part of the deal.</p><p>Mobile gaming is also a significant factor in the acquisition, Microsoft said. On top of folding King&#39;s phone games into Microsoft&#39;s business, the purchase promises to bring franchises like <em>Halo</em> and <em>Warcraft</em> to more devices.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The buyout is expected to close sometime in Microsoft&#39;s fiscal 2023 (no later than June 2023) if regulators and Activision Blizzard shareholders greenlight the move. The boards of directors for both companies have already approved the deal.</p><p>While news of the acquisition comes as Activision Blizzard is still <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-departures-discipline-bobby-kotick-212356578.html">embroiled in a misconduct scandal</a>, you shouldn&#39;t expect significant leadership changes. Bobby Kotick will remain Activision Blizzard&#39;s CEO despite <a href="https://www.engadget.com/activision-blizzard-call-for-bobby-kotick-resignation-194953539.html">calls for his resignation</a>, and will now report to Microsoft Gaming chief Phil Spencer. In a <a href="https://activisionblizzard.com/newsroom/2022/01/defining-the-future">company letter</a>, Kotick described Microsoft&#39;s move as a chance to &quot;further strengthen&quot; Activision Blizzard&#39;s workplace culture and &quot;set a new standard&quot; for inclusiveness. He didn&#39;t outline specific plans for reform, but did say there would be &quot;minimal changes&quot; to staff counts after the union was complete.</p><p>If it moves forward, the merger would help Microsoft compete with heavyweights <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tencent-sumo-acquisition-091425058.html">Tencent</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-buys-returnal-developer-housemarque-104158645.html">Sony</a>, which have both been on buying sprees in recent months. Kotick also saw this helping his company better compete as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html">metaverse</a> gaming rises to prominence. In that light, this may be as much a matter of future-proofing the company as anything else.</p><p>Some major questions remain, though. Microsoft didn&#39;t say how many Activision Blizzard games would be Xbox-exclusive on consoles, or Windows-exclusive on computers. It&#39;s also unclear how much Microsoft might influence development of key franchises. It&#39;s not certain Microsoft will lock <em>Call of Duty</em> or other giant games to the Xbox in the near future, though ‚Äî PlayStation sales represent a large chunk of Activision Blizzard&#39;s revenue, and dropping that platform would significantly reduce the company&#39;s clout in the games industry.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">152c8376-8283-4bde-8c80-4dc05e873f6f</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 13:36:37 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642514742</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T14:52:56+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mergers, Acquisitions & Takeovers]]></category><category><![CDATA[Investment & Company Information]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6a50220-7862-11ec-bc3d-ed585414cdfe" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f6a50220-7862-11ec-bc3d-ed585414cdfe" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Microsoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Microsoft acquisition of Activision Blizzard]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[UK government announces official crackdown on 'misleading' crypto ads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The UK government has <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-to-strengthen-rules-on-misleading-cryptocurrency-adverts">revealed</a> that it plans to update its laws in order &quot;to bring the promotion of cryptoassets within the scope of financial promotions legislation.&quot; That will ensure any crypto promotion will be held to the same standards as promotion for stocks, shares and insurance products. It also has fall in line with the rules set by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p><p>Governments have recently started cracking down on crypto ads in an effort to protect consumers from scams they may not be familiar with. The Spanish government is currently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spain-influencers-cryptocurrency-promotion-rules-advertising-172028187.html">establishing</a> rules on how influencers and their sponsors promote cryptocurrencies. Meanwhile, Singapore&#39;s authorities <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-17/singapore-tells-crypto-firms-not-to-market-services-to-public?sref=10lNAhZ9">asked</a> crypto companies outright not to market their services to the public. One type of scam is the &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/kim-kardashian-floyd-mayweather-sued-alleged-crypto-scam-092422470.html">pump and dump</a>,&quot; in which fraudsters find ways to artificially inflate the value of a cryptocurrency and to get people to invest money in it. They then unload their shares while the value is high to make a lot of money, thereby lowering the coin&#39;s value in the process.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the UK government, approximately 2.3 million people in the country are now thought to own a cryptoasset. While cryptoassets&#39; popularity is rising, the FCA&#39;s research <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1047232/Cryptoasset_Financial_Promotions_Response.pdf">suggests</a> (PDF) that potential investors&#39; level of understanding about them is on the decline. That means people may not be fully aware of the risks involved when it comes to investing in them, which further supports &quot;the case for regulatory intervention to ensure that cryptoasset promotions are fair, clear, and not misleading. &quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/uk-announces-plan-to-set-stricter-rules-for-crypto-ads-132529935.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3a51eb30-1399-4f65-9d8a-3aaa59b62970</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 13:25:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642511015</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T13:03:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Finance]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5e108980-7858-11ec-9cfd-0140d2b38a27" width="3835" height="2158" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/5e108980-7858-11ec-9cfd-0140d2b38a27" width="3835" height="2158" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Vagengeym_Elena via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Faceless girl holds golden physical bitcoin and shows Okay sign, thumbs up, ok gesture.

However, <a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Speakers-and-Displays/White-Noise-ambient-sound-has-changed-is-there-a-way-to-change/m-p/84041">multiple users have noticed</a> that Google recently changed that to something that loops more frequently and has a muffled sound, according to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2022/01/15/google-home-white-noise/"><em>9to5Google</em></a>.

On top of that, the previously crisp sound file is now apparently &quot;muffled&quot; and quieter than before. &quot;It&#39;s a different pitch, almost muffled,&quot; said one user. &quot;Very annoying you have to set the volume to 70 percent,&quot; another noted.&nbsp;</p><p>There are at least 100 complaints along the same lines, with many people saying they use the white noise to get their babies or toddlers to sleep. &quot;I play it every night for my toddler and she&#39;s really upset about this change,&quot; said one. &quot;Please, let there be a way to get the older version back so we can maintain our sleep schedule and sanity!&quot;</p><p>Google may have changed the file to reduce data usage, as one Redditor said that his Mini used about 4GB of data every night just playing Google&#39;s ambient noises. Another acknowledged that this is a &quot;first world problem,&quot; but it goes to show how tiny changes in widely used technology can cause unintended problems. If you use the old sound and miss it, another Reddit user has <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/googlehome/comments/s4b30o/white_noise_ambient_sound_has_changed/">uploaded the original</a> to Google Drive, so you could in theory download it and cast to YouTube Music.&nbsp;</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-changed-the-white-noise-on-nest-devices-and-users-are-not-happy-125022202.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9b6965ef-d57b-461a-9d2a-be6758b79317</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 12:50:22 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642510115</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T12:48:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7cfe08b0-7851-11ec-bddf-8e9f67f94533" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/7cfe08b0-7851-11ec-bddf-8e9f67f94533" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google changed the 'white noise' on Nest devices and users are not having it]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google changed the 'white noise' on Nest devices and users are not having it]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Spain sets rules (and fines) for cryptocurrency promotion]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Governments are paying more attention to the rise and rise of cryptocurrencies ‚Äì and their tax implications ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs the major players like Bitcoin and Ethereum or newcomers looking to pick up users, investors and headlines.</p><p>In Spain, influencers and other advertisers with more than 100,000 followers will soon have to notify the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) at least 10 days before plugging crypto assets.

The premium range of multi-sport GPS watches has come a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/garmin-fenix-instinct-tactix-solar-110041267.html">long way</a> over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-18-garmin-fenix-5-plus-gps-watch.html">the last</a> 10 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-02-20-garmin-fenix-2-gps-watch.html">years</a>, and the new 7-series adds a few new tricks.&nbsp;</p><p>Most notably, Fenix 7 line will now include touchscreens. It might seem something of an odd omission thus far, but the great outdoors tends to mean gloves, sweat, motion and the elements ‚Äî all of which can play havoc with a touchscreen. As such, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how responsive it is under active conditions. Although other Garmin watches, like the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-04-garmin-venu-great-fitness-wearable.html">Venu</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-05-garmin-vivoactive-watch-release-date-price-hands-on.html">vivoactive</a> lines, have had touchscreens for a while so this isn&#39;t a first for the company by any stretch, but a new addition to the Fenix line.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="acb5704a5edb47b9aac8fb3fec17a57f"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c9b2stk6VDg?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Another addition includes a new multi-LED flashlight. Handy for those camping trips or early morning/late night runs. Not only is it a general-purpose light, but it can also alternate between red and white as you run, matching your personal cadence, so traffic or cyclists can be alerted to your presence (and direction).</p><p>As usual, the Fenix comes in three models/sizes: the 7S/7 and premium 7X which measure 42, 47 and 51 mm across respectively. All have solar-charging options and Garmin claims the new casing includes a larger screen surface area which could see solar gains doubling over the Fenix 6 line. This potentially puts the total time between charges (without using GPS) at up to five weeks, which is pretty impressive for a smartwatch of this size.</p><p>Beyond the hardware changes on the Fenix, there are some new advanced training modes too. These include Real-Time Stamina, Visual Race Predictor, Recovery Time Advison and Daily Workout Suggestions. These features join the already extensive offering of topo-maps, golf courses and surf/snow features that lie hidden within the Fenix&#39;s extensive sporting options.</p><p>All the models and varieties in the Fenix 7 line are available as of today, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:starting at $700" href="https://fave.co/3GGKVwy">starting at $700</a>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/garmin-fenix-7-series-touchscreen-flaslight-120021147.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">11fa20ce-0103-40a7-8cab-2d7ada28f1c1</guid><dc:creator>James Trew</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 12:00:21 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642512326</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T13:25:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|James Trew]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d890c360-7852-11ec-b7fb-f2ab14d0fb4e" width="1200" height="600" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/d890c360-7852-11ec-b7fb-f2ab14d0fb4e" width="1200" height="600" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Garmin]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Garmin Fenix 7 series adds touchscreens and an cadence-matching flashlight.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Garmin Fenix 7]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Logitech's new 'Pen' is a rechargeable stylus for classroom Chromebooks]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Logitech has launched a new stylus called the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Logitech Pen" href="https://fave.co/3fzXE8h">Logitech Pen</a> designed specifically with K-12 students in mind.

Google <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-01-google-universal-stylus-initiative.html">backed</a> the initiative in 2018 and joined other supporters like Intel and Lenovo in their quest to create an open active stylus standard, and a bunch of manufacturers has released USI-compatible Chromebooks over the years since then.&nbsp;</p><p>The Logitech Pen works with various models across brands, namely Lenovo, Acer, HP, Asus and Samsung. Michele Hermann, Vice President of Mobility and Head of Education Solutions at Logitech, said in a statement: &quot;Given that students and educators are increasingly using Chromebooks as an everyday tool in schools and at home, we created the Logitech Pen to unlock the full potential of Chromebooks in the classroom.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Logitech Pen has a silicone grip, non-slip design and comes in a size that even children can hold comfortably.

As per the standard, the Logitech Pen doesn&#39;t need to be paired beforehand, so students can just pick it up and use it.&nbsp;</p><p>The Pen&#39;s battery can last for up to 15 days with regular school use and can be charged using a standard USB-C Charger. And, since it&#39;s designed for students, it&#39;s also spill-proof and has military-grade drop protection of up to four feet.

Now, Square Enix has <a href="https://press.uk.square-enix.com/BELOVED-KINGDOM-HEARTS-TITLES-COMING-TO-NINTENDO-SWITCH-VIA-CLOUD-ON-F">announced</a> that the three games, <em>Kingdom Hearts - HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMix</em>, <em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue </em>and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Kingdom%20Hearts%20III"><em>Kingdom Hearts III</em></a> will arrive to Switch via cloud on February 10th for a rather exorbitant $90, or $72 on pre-order.&nbsp;</p><p>That&#39;s essentially the entire series so far, covering Sora&#39;s journey up to the most recent chapter, <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em>. The series is one Square Enix&#39;s <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Best_selling_Square-Enix_games">best-selling franchises</a> of all time, particularly the original and <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> titles.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="4d7dab0d6e5f43eea8749e89811e173d"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J0CQp7npkeQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Because the Switch trilogy is a cloud version, you&#39;ll need a reasonably fast internet connection to have a decent experience. While a cloud release seems valid for the latest <em>Kingdom Hearts III</em> chapter <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-06-10-kingdom-hearts-iii-release-date.html">first released</a> on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, one has to wonder why the first two games couldn&#39;t have been remade to run directly on the Switch. After all, it can run <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-20-the-witcher-3-switch-hands-on.html"><em>Witcher 3</em></a> and the Assassin&#39;s Creed collection that&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/assassins-creed-the-ezio-collection-nintendo-switch-february-17-202041391.html">set to arrive</a> on February 18th.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By purchasing the all-in-one collection or individual<em> Kingdom Hearts III</em> version, you&#39;ll receive the Advent Red Keyblade for use in the <em>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind (DLC)</em>, Square Enix said. There will also be a Kingdom Hearts <a href="https://twitter.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1483320750001905667">20th anniversary event</a> in Tokyo, with a mini concert, Q&amp;A with the development team, an exhibition and more.&nbsp;</p><p>The collection is <a href="https://www.kingdomhearts.com/switch/en-us/">now available for pre-order</a> at $72. If that&#39;s too much, you can pre-order individual titles for prices varying from $33 to $40. The trilogy price climbs to $90 afterwards, so if you&#39;re interested, try to pick it up ahead of the February 10th release date.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 1/18/2022 6:15 AM ET</strong>: Pre-order and full pricing added.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/kingdom-hearts-trilogy-is-coming-to-the-switch-on-february-10th-103034500.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6189b547-852f-4ea6-9045-92007600e32c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jan 2022 10:30:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642504876</ingested><modified>2022-01-18T11:21:27+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/968766f0-7847-11ec-adf9-cb6575c9861c" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/968766f0-7847-11ec-adf9-cb6575c9861c" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['Kingdom Hearts' trilogy for cloud is coming to the Nintendo Switch on February 10th]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['Kingdom Hearts' trilogy for cloud is coming to the Nintendo Switch on February 10th]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung's Exynos 2200 mobile processor uses an AMD ray tracing GPU]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung has revealed the <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-game-changing-exynos-2200-processor-with-xclipse-gpu-powered-by-amd-rdna-2-architecture">Exynos 2200</a>, its first mobile processor with an AMD RDNA 2-powered GPU that will allow ray-tracing and other gaming features.

In addition to a more capable GPU, it comes with two extra USB-A ports (its more affordable sibling only has USB-C connectivity), Gigabit Ethernet and a Magic Keyboard with Touch ID. Those might seem like small additions, but they add a lot to the useability of the machine.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-imac-24-inch-amazon-sale-172019869.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8159844e-a5ad-4d2a-aa6d-89c98f97dfe5</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 17:20:19 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642438533</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T16:55:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Computing]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/f4fdb100-b752-11eb-ab79-10956a28523a" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/f4fdb100-b752-11eb-ab79-10956a28523a" width="2000" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Devindra Hardawar/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iMac M1 24-inch]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iMac M1 24-inch]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple Watch Series 7 models are up to 15 percent off at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#39;ve been waiting for a decent deal on an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-7-review-all-about-the-screen-130036181.html">Apple Watch Series 7</a>, now might be the time to take the leap.

Revolutionaries sought to break the nation free from its past, specifically from the clutches of the Catholic church, and point France towards a more glorious and prosperous future. They did so, in part, by radically transforming their measurements of the passage of time.</p><p>Throughout the 18th century, most French folks were Catholic as that was the only religion allowed to be openly practiced in the country, and had been since the revocation of the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Edict-of-Nantes"><ins>Edict of Nantes</ins></a> in 1685. As such, the nation had traditionally adhered to the 12-month Gregorian calendar ‚Äî itself based on even older, sexagesimal (6-unit) divisible systems adapted from the Babylonians and Egyptians ‚Äî while French clocks cycled every 60 minutes and seconds.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But if there was little reason to continue using the established chronology system aside from tradition, the revolutionaries figured, why not transmute it into a more rational, scientifically-backed method, just as the revolution itself sought to bring stability and new order to French society as a whole? And what better system to interpose than that of the decimal, which already governed the nation‚Äôs weights and measures. So, while it wasn‚Äôt busy abolishing the privileges of the First and Second Estate, eliminating the church‚Äôs power to levy taxes or just <a href="https://revolution.chnm.org/d/392/"><ins>drowning nonjuring Catholic priests en masse</ins></a>, France‚Äôs neophyte post-revolution government set about reforming the realm‚Äôs calendars and clocks.</p><p>The concept of decimal time, wherein a day is broken down into multiples of 10, was first suggested more than thirty years prior when French mathematician, Jean le Rond d&#39;Alembert, <a href="http://artflx.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.3:1756.encyclopedie0311.6994586"><ins>argued</ins></a> in 1754, ‚ÄúIt would be very desirable that all divisions, for example of the livre, the sou, the toise, the day, the hour, etc. would be from tens into tens. This division would result in much easier and more convenient calculations and would be very preferable to the arbitrary division of the livre into twenty sous, of the sou into twelve deniers, of the day into twenty-four hours, the hour into sixty minutes, etc.‚Äù</p><p>By the eve of the Revolution, <a href="https://archive.org/details/dcouvertedtalon00collgoog/page/n8/mode/2up"><ins>the idea had evolved into</ins></a> a year split into 12 months of 30 days apiece, their names inspired by crops and the prevailing weather in Paris during their occurrences. That there are 365 days in a year is an immutable fact dictated by the movement of the Earth around our local star. So, 12 months of 30 days apiece resulted in 5 days (6 in a leap year!) left over. These, the revolutionaries reserved for national holidays.</p><p>Each week was divided into 10 days, every day was split into 10 equal hours, those were split into 100 minutes, with each minute divided into 100 seconds (roughly 1.5 times longer than conventional minutes) and each second into 1000 ‚Äútierces.‚Äù Individual tierces could also be divided into 1000 even tinier units, called ‚Äúquatierces.‚Äù The implementation of tierces would also lead to the creation of a new unit of length, called the ‚Äúhalf-handbreadth,‚Äù which is the distance the twilight zone travels along the equator over the course of one tierce, and equal to one billionth of the planet‚Äôs circumference ‚Äî around 4 centimeters.</p><p>Decimal time was formally adopted by <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Time_and_the_French_Revolution/y7fEHa7eHYEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1"><ins>National Convention decree in 1793</ins></a>, ‚ÄúThe day, from midnight to midnight, is divided into ten parts, each part into ten others, and so forth until the smallest measurable portion of duration.‚Äù As such, midnight would be denoted as 00:00 while noon would be 5:00.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/adaf6f80-7572-11ec-9cf7-0e1ed884f638" style="height:471;width:473;" alt="A clock face with decimal and conventional demarcations" data-uuid="823b6058-abd4-395e-a5de-41d0f53b8430"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Public Domain</div></figure><p>At midnight of the autumn equinox on September 22nd of that year, France‚Äôs Gregorian calendar ushered in 1st Vend√©miaire Year II of the French Republican calendar. From there on, every new year would begin at midnight of the Autumn equinox, as observed by the Paris Observatory.</p><p>‚ÄúThe new calendar was based on two principles,‚Äù a 2017 exhibition at the International Museum of Watches, <a href="https://journal.hautehorlogerie.org/en/decimal-time-the-revolution-that-never-was/"><em><ins>Looking for Noon at Five O‚ÄôClock</ins></em></a>, noted. ‚ÄúThat the Republican year should coincide with the movement of the planets, and that it should measure time more accurately and more symmetrically by applying the decimal system wherever possible. Non-religious, it advocated a rational approach and honored the seasons and work in the fields.‚Äù</p><p>The main advantage of a decimal time system is that, since the base used to divide the time is the same as the one used to represent it, the whole time representation can be handled as a single string.</p><p>On one hand, this system offered the clear advantage that both the numerical base used to define the time and the numerical base used to divide it are the same number. For example, quick, how many seconds are there in three hours? The answer, most people will Google, is 10,800 ‚Äî 60 seconds/minute x 60 minutes/hour x 3 hours. In decimal time, you simply get 30,000 ‚Äî 3 hours x 10,000 seconds/hour.</p><div id="a6716291bab44ccb83415c3fea065f1e"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/KncbFme" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>However, due to an oversight in its otherwise logical design on account of gaps in astronomical knowledge, the Republican calendar struggled to properly accommodate leap years. ‚ÄúThe four-year period, after which the addition of a day is usually necessary, is called the Franciade in memory of the revolution which, after four years of effort, led France to republican government, <a href="https://www.google.com/books/edition/Time_and_the_French_Revolution/y7fEHa7eHYEC?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1"><ins>National Convention decreed</ins></a>. ‚ÄúThe fourth year of the Franciade is called Sextile.‚Äù</p><p>Problem is that leap years, if we‚Äôre counting new years by midnights on the autumnal equinox in Paris, don‚Äôt consistently happen every four years. By equinox measure, the first leap year of the Republican calendar would actually have to occur in year III while the leaps in years XV and XX would happen half a decade apart.</p><p>There were also more practical issues with swapping the nation‚Äôs chronology over to an entirely new system, like the fact that people already had perfectly good clocks which they‚Äôd have to replace, were decimal time to remain in effect. It was also wildly unpopular with the working class who would only receive one day of rest out of 10 using the Republican calendar (plus a half day on the fifth), rather than the existing Gregorian one-day-in-seven, not to mention that the ten-day week played havoc with traditional Sunday religious services, seeing as how Sunday would cease to exist.</p><p>Overall, the idea simply failed to capture public support ‚Äî despite edicts demanding the creation of decimal-based clocks ‚Äî and was officially suspended on April 7th, 1795. The French then took a quick crack at metric time, which similarly measured time‚Äôs passage in factors of ten but based its progression in conventional seconds (aka 1/86400th of a day). Of course all of these efforts were rendered moot when Napoleon declared himself emperor in 1804, made peace with the Vatican and reinstituted the Gregorian calendar, thereby relegating both the Republican calendar and decimal time to the dustbin of history. The lesson here being, unless <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l08mxSnz8-k"><ins>you‚Äôve </ins><em><ins>TNG‚Äôd</ins></em><ins> yourself into a temporal loop</ins></a>, don‚Äôt try to fix what isn‚Äôt already broken, especially when it might earn you a trip to the guillotine.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/that-time-france-tried-to-make-decimal-time-a-thing-143600302.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">4af922d3-5806-437d-bb2f-a9adde48ae26</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 14:36:00 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642190234</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T19:57:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd69be90-7572-11ec-bb7b-c715e18ce1c7" width="2000" height="1503" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd69be90-7572-11ec-bb7b-c715e18ce1c7" width="2000" height="1503" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[pjjones via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The number ten in my clockface number series.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[number ten]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon UK won't ban Visa credit cards on January 19th after all]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last November, Amazon <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-stop-accepting-uk-issued-visa-credit-cards-101233882.html">notified customers</a> that it would stop accepting Visa credit cards in the UK as of January 19th, 2022, blaming the high fees Visa charges for credit card transactions.

That price makes it an excellent budget kids option, thanks to the decent specs (a quad-core processor, dual cameras and expandable storage), along with the Kids+ content that includes educational content from National Geographic, Rabbids Coding, LEGO and others.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3nynNsl" id="6e274be05b244575bc65dc083542c103" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire 7 Kids Pro tablet">Buy Fire 7 Kids Pro tablet at Amazon - $50</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3FucOGE" id="93d0215c1e484823953919e1c52d30f8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids Pro tablet">Buy Fire HD 8 Kids Pro tablet at Amazon - $80</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3Gvt63n" id="4f11cf19b47c45e5bc80069e537bc95b" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet">Buy Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet at Amazon - $140</a><p>Finally, the Fire HD 8 Kids Pro Tablet, with similar features to the Fire HD 7 Kids Pro but a slightly larger screen, is available for $80, for a savings of 43 percent from the regular $140 price.

However, the UK Home Office is reportedly planning an ad campaign to mobilize public opinion against end-to-end encryption using what critics called &quot;scaremongering&quot; tactics, according to a report from <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/revealed-uk-government-publicity-blitz-to-undermine-privacy-encryption-1285453/"><em>Rolling Stone</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The UK government plans to team up with charities and law enforcement agencies on a public relations blitz created by M&amp;C Saatchi advertising agency, the report states. The aim of the campaign is to relay a message that end-to-end encryption could hamper efforts to curb child exploitation online.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We have engaged M&amp;C Saatchi to bring together the many organizations who share our concerns about the impact end-to-end encryption would have on our ability to keep children safe,&quot; a Home Office spokesperson told <em>Rolling Stone</em> in a statement. The government has allocated ¬£534,000 ($730,500) for the blitz, according to a letter sent from the Home Office in response to a freedom of information request.&nbsp;</p><p>The campaign may include elements designed to make the public &quot;uneasy,&quot; according to a slideshow designed to help it recruit non-profit coalition partners. That includes a proposed stunt with adult and child actors placed in a glass box as it fades to black. It also involves a &quot;social media activation where we ask parents to write to Mark [Zuckerberg] via their Facebook status.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>One slide noted that &quot;most of the public have never heard&quot; of end-to-end encryption, meaning they can &quot;be easily swayed&quot; on the subject. It also states that the government &quot;must not start a privacy vs safety debate.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Privacy advocates called the plans &quot;scaremongering&quot; and said that a lack of end-to-end encryption could have the opposite intended effect. &quot;Without strong encryption, children are more vulnerable online than ever. Encryption protects personal safety and national security‚Ä¶ what the government is proposing puts everyone at risk,&quot; Internet Society&#39;s Robin Wilton told <em>Rolling Stone</em>.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-government-is-reportedly-planning-ad-campaign-attacking-end-to-end-encryption-101610703.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d30437b-ffc2-4ed5-a2fa-097ad935942b</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2022 10:16:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642418627</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T11:23:59+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b565ae80-777d-11ec-bdfb-ffe00afc91bf" width="3311" height="2220" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b565ae80-777d-11ec-bdfb-ffe00afc91bf" width="3311" height="2220" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Stephen Hird / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A general view shows the headquarters of Britain's Home Office in central London January 15, 2007.

The feature is designed to &quot;reduce ambient noise on phone calls when you are holding the receiver to your ear,&quot; a feature that can help make calls easier to hear.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Phone Noise Cancellation is not available on iPhone 13 models, which is why you do not see this option in [the Accessibility] settings,&quot; Apple support told one of <em>9to5Mac</em>&#39;s readers. When the reader asked for clarification, the support team confirmed that the feature is &quot;not supported.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Questions about noise cancellation came up on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/rn8dkj/why_is_no_one_talking_about_apple_removing_noise/?sort=top">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253217147">Apple support pages</a> shortly after the phone went on sale, with readers noticing that it was no longer available on the Accessibility page.

The STI E-RA Concept hints at Subaru&#39;s upcoming track vehicle with 1,073HP of total power from its four Yamaha motors, extensive downforce and all-wheel drive mated to a &quot;unique&quot; torque vectoring system that maximizes grip and stability.</p><p>While the 60kWh battery is relatively small, Subaru is confident the E-RA can thrive on the track. It&#39;s hoping to set a N√ºrburgring lap time of 6 minutes and 40 seconds at some point in 2023. That&#39;s not as quick as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-03-vw-id-r-breaks-nurburgring-efficiency-record.html">VW&#39;s ID.R</a> (6 minutes 5 seconds), but it&#39;s comfortably ahead of road cars like Tesla&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-09-18-intrigue-at-the-nurburgring-as-tesla-unofficially-beats-porsche.html">Model S Plaid</a> (7 minutes 35 seconds).

Subaru didn&#39;t discuss under-body changes, but the upgraded Solterra has a roof spoiler, skirt spoilers and other customizations to signal its performance ambitions.</p><p>However much the E-RA represents Subaru&#39;s motorsport plans, it&#39;s also serving as a declaration of intent. Like VW&#39;s racer, it shows the company is serious about EVs and can produce high-performance cars in addition to everyday people haulers. The challenge is to translate lessons learned from concepts like this to regular vehicles. Subaru is late to EVs compared even to incumbents like VW, Mercedes and GM, and it may need to move quickly if it wants to counter the electrification efforts of its rivals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/subaru-sti-e-ra-concept-electric-race-car-213630682.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5f98962-82ac-4c6c-95ef-1f34416111bb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 21:36:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642368991</ingested><modified>2022-01-17T03:43:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cb17fa40-7709-11ec-a4be-a9544de38301" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cb17fa40-7709-11ec-a4be-a9544de38301" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Subaru]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Subaru STI E-RA Concept electric race car]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Subaru STI E-RA Concept electric race car]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
