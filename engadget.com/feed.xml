According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/technology/facebook-ai-race-primates.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, users who recently watched a video posted by <em>Daily Mail</em> featuring Black men saw a prompt asking them if they&#39;d like to &quot;[k]eep seeing videos about Primates.&quot; The social network apologized for the &quot;unacceptable error&quot; in a statement sent to the publication. It also disabled the recommendation feature that was responsible for the message as it looks into the cause to prevent serious errors like this from happening again.</p><p>Company spokeswoman Dani Lever said in a statement: &quot;As we have said, while we have made improvements to our AI, we know it&#39;s not perfect, and we have more progress to make. We apologize to anyone who may have seen these offensive recommendations.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Gender and racial bias in artificial intelligence is hardly a problem that&#39;s unique to the social network — facial recognition technologies are still far from perfect and tend to misidentify POCs and women in general. Last year, false facial recognition matches led to the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facial-recognition-false-match-wrongful-arrest-224053761.html">wrongful arrests</a> of two Black men in Detroit. In 2015, Google Photos <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-17-google-lens-resurfaces-questions-about-ai-and-human-identity.html">tagged</a> the photos of Black people as &quot;gorillas,&quot; and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/when-it-comes-to-gorillas-google-photos-remains-blind/"><em>Wired</em></a> found a few years later that the tech giant&#39;s solution was to censor the word &quot;gorilla&quot; from searches and image tags.</p><p>The social network <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-casual-conversations-164814735.html">shared a dataset</a> it created with the AI community in an effort to combat the issue a few months ago. It contained over 40,000 videos featuring 3,000 paid actors who shared their age and gender with the company. Facebook even hired professionals to light their shoot and to label their skin tones, so AI systems can learn what people of different ethnicities look like under various lighting conditions. The dataset clearly wasn&#39;t enough to completely solve AI bias for Facebook, further demonstrating that the AI community still has a lot of work ahead of it.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-ai-mislabels-video-black-men-primates-044255703.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">00813740-beae-457a-912d-25c194ecf633</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 04:42:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630730608</ingested><modified>2021-09-04T04:43:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61d84470-0d2f-11ec-b7ff-aec40b61b306" width="5122" height="3415" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/61d84470-0d2f-11ec-b7ff-aec40b61b306" width="5122" height="3415" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sundry Photography via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[December 27, 2017 Menlo Park / CA / USA - A group of friends posing in front of the Facebook Like Button sign located at the entrance to the company's main headquarters located in Silicon Valley]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[A group of friends posing in front of the Facebook Like Button]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Rivian’s electric pickup and SUV officially have over 300 miles of range]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rivian-electric-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-delay-180542789.html"><ins>few short weeks</ins></a>, Rivian will start shipping its first R1T pickup and R1S SUV &quot;Launch Edition&quot; models to consumers.

All of the player vs. player updates will be reflected in the current game (<em>OW2</em> will have a big focus on co-op story missions too).&nbsp;</p><p>The sequel will herald new modes and maps, a fresh game engine, more characters, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-hero-redesigns-sombra-baptiste-193556978.html"><ins>an overhaul of existing heroes</ins></a> and, most significantly, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-2-5-v-5-212441103.html"><ins>a shift from teams of six to squads of five</ins></a>, with each side fielding one tank instead of the current two. That&#39;ll likely have an impact on Overwatch League rosters for next season and beyond, with fewer spots available for tank players.</p><p>Moving OWL to <em>Overwatch 2 </em>in this fashion has its pros and cons, especially given that it&#39;ll be an early build. If the latest release timeline reports are accurate, though, the game will be almost ready for public consumption by that point, so there hopefully won&#39;t be many bugs. What&#39;s more, OWL players will want to practice on public servers as much as possible, so there might be an <em>Overwatch 2</em> beta, at the very least, by April.</p><p>Plans could change and OWL might stick with the current version of <em>Overwatch </em>if there are any significant development hurdles. However, if Blizzard can get the early build ready in time, the next Overwatch League season could give the publisher a great opportunity to show off <em>Overwatch 2 </em>to fans before the game eventually arrives.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/overwatch-league-2022-season-overwatch-2-early-build-185655840.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">09b9d582-6b13-4f69-ad04-e546d4a8c9a8</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 18:56:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630695418</ingested><modified>2021-09-03T18:57:10+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0bd88280-0ce7-11ec-bb7f-8a835ee0b2bc" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/0bd88280-0ce7-11ec-bb7f-8a835ee0b2bc" width="2000" height="1125" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Blizzard Entertainment]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 hero Winston]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Overwatch 2 hero Winston]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Nissan is testing a more efficient way to recycle rare-earth metals from EV motors]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Working since 2017 with Tokyo’s Waseda University, Nissan says it has developed and <a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/release-93a33f4b8e6462d7cb9e10107e03e28e-nissan-and-waseda-university-in-japan-testing-jointly-developed-recycling-process-for-electrified-vehicle-motors#"><ins>recently started testing</ins></a> a new recycling process that represents a more efficient and cost-effective way of recovering rare-earth metals from electric motors.</p><div id="03d15d4acd284548afabb277b5f8504b"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VWRhDR-ZEtM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>The process itself involves heating a used motor to 1,400 degrees Celsius (approximately 2,552 degrees Fahrenheit) so that it melts down.

What sets this model apart from many others is that you don&#39;t need to install a boundary wire. Instead, Navimow uses GPS and other sensors to stay within the perimeter of your lawn.</p><p>A so-called Exact Fusion Locating System can maintain Navimow&#39;s position accurate to within two centimeters, according to Segway. If the GPS signal ever dips, the company says the device&#39;s array of sensors and data ensure it will still work. You can tell Navimow where to mow, define the boundaries and instruct it to avoid certain parts of your garden via an app. Segway claims Navimow uses an algorithm to figure out a mowing path so it doesn&#39;t have to criss-cross.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="ab7b4d1bf53144ca8d8221aaa7c829b8"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8etNM_BXY0A?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Segway says Navimow operates relatively quietly at 54 dB. There are offset blades to trim edges and corners, while the mower gradually cuts grass from above to reach the height you want (between three and six centimeters). The mower can handle 45-degree inclines and it has an IPX6 water resistance rating, according to Segway.</p><p>There are safety features too. Segway says Navimow can detect and bypass obstacles, and its blades will stop spinning if pets or kids get too close. If the device detects rain, it&#39;ll return to the charging station, but you can turn off the rain sensor and put Navimow to work even when it&#39;s wet outside. When the battery gets too low, Navimow will continue cutting from where it left off after it recharges.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/73f96ca0-0cdb-11ec-aff7-c35e0ee8012c" style="height:900;width:1600;" alt="Segway Navimow robot mower" data-uuid="73a485db-745f-319c-a448-3516ef78aaad"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Segway</div></figure><p>Installing a perimeter wire can take some time and as <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/segway-built-a-smarter-robot-lawnmower-03689488/"><em><ins>SlashGear</ins></em></a> notes, it can damage a garden, since it&#39;s usually buried under grass.

This humble molecule is critical to space exploration and exoplanetary colonization which is why, ahead of an international effort to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon (aka <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-19-nasa-artemis-explainer-apollo-missions.html">the Artemis Program</a>), NASA scientists plan to land the world’s first autonomous lunar rover there in search of dihydrogen-monoxide deposits worth their weight in gold.</p><p>We’ve known that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-moon-sunlight-water-sofia-artemis-162600047.html">there is water ice on the Moon’s surface</a> for nearly thirty years — potentially hundreds of millions of gallons buried amid regolith <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-08-21-nasa-confirms-ice-moon-poles.html">at the poles</a> — thanks to the pioneering efforts of the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/14apr_moonwater.html">Lunar Prospector</a>, <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LCROSS/main/">LCROSS</a>, and <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/SOFIA/index.html">SOFIA</a> missions.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="0c5d398097d74938a7db09942a51cf11"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U70y8ypCbyA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>“Every mission, no matter what type, whether roving or not, will be standing on the shoulders of what was learned by other missions before,” Dan Andrews, VIPER project manager, told Engadget. “Otherwise you&#39;re just throwing away really good learning.”</p><p>However, we don’t necessarily have a great understanding of how those frozen molecules are actually distributed or how to best extract them from the lunar soil — and that’s where the upcoming Volatiles Investigating Polar Exploration Rover (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/viper/overview">VIPER</a>) mission comes in.</p><p>This golf cart-sized machine will be delivered to the Moon’s South Pole in late 2023 and spend its scheduled 100-day mission scouring the area for four “ice stability regions” — surface regions where we might find ice just laying about, shallow regions where the ice is covered by 50 centimeters of regolith, deep regions where the ice is buried up to 100 centimeters, and dry regions where there is no ice present below 100 centimeters. Andrews notes that “those regions exist all over the place in both the North and the South Pole. There&#39;s thousands of them.”</p><p>As the VIPER trundles about, it will employ its Neutron Spectrometer System (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/viper/rover">NSS</a>) to indirectly survey the soil around itself in search of water at depths up to three feet (.9m) by looking for the energy losses in cosmic rays (mostly in the form of neutrons) that occur when they strike hydrogen molecules. And where there’s hydrogen, there could well be water.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/5ef5aa80-0c09-11ec-bf79-50349414ad04" alt="NRVSS" data-uuid="dd115263-6f64-3070-ab1b-7d29364b3220"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure><p>Once the NSS finds a suitable concentration, the VIPER will deploy its meter-long <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/viper/rover">TRIDENT</a> (The Regolith and Ice Drill for Exploring New Terrains) to drill down and pull up soil samples for examination by the onboard Near-Infrared Volatiles Spectrometer System (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/viper/rover">NIRVSS</a> pronounced “nervous”), which can identify the hydrogen’s form, whether that’s free hydrogen atoms or slightly more complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxyl_radical">hydroxyls</a>. And even before the rover sets a wheel off its orbital delivery vehicle, the Mass Spectrometer Observing Lunar Operations (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/viper/rover">MSolo</a>) will be sampling gases kicked up during landing in search of stray hydrogen atoms.</p><p>When the LCROSS mission slammed a probe into the moon’s surface, it measured and analyzed the resulting ejecta for water ice using variations of nine commercially available instruments that could be traced back to “everything from NASCAR car instrumentation to manufacturing.” The VIPER mission is taking a similar tack. While not directly a part of the mission itself, other units of the instruments that will land aboard VIPER <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/ames/viper-moon-rover-s-instruments-tested-for-early-lunar-flight">will also be delivered to the Moon in both 2021 and 2022</a> as part of NASA’s <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/commercial-lunar-payload-services">Commercial Lunar Payload Services</a> program for use in various experiments. This will serve as a sort of shake-down cruise for the instruments, allowing the VIPER team to see how the gear they’re sending will operate under real-world conditions. “If the instruments work beautifully, well great,” Andrews said. “If the instruments have a peculiar behavior that was unexpected, we can plan that in. And if they outright fail... we at least have the chance to try to diagnose why it did go wrong.”</p><p>While it won’t be the first wheeled vehicle to roll across the Moon, it will be the first autonomous vehicle to do so with a mission far more important than ferrying astronauts around. But the Moon is a harsh and unforgiving mistress, presenting an entirely unique set of challenges not faced by the larger rovers currently crawling over Mars. For one thing, Mars has an (albeit thin) atmosphere, the Moon has none, “which means it gets really, really hot, and it gets really, really cold,” Andrews said. “There&#39;s no moderating atmosphere so that becomes a really strong design point for the rover.”</p><div id="489cc8cdbb654480997b962a1423e477"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/qmFqSna?card=1" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>What’s more, at the South Pole where the VIPER will be prowling the sun will rarely get more than 10 degrees above the horizon, which causes “unbelievably long shadows,” he continued. “And since there&#39;s no atmosphere, the lighting conditions are such that it looks to be very, very bright and right next to it can be unbelievably dark and black,” which can create havoc for visual navigation systems.</p><p>And then there’s the regolith — the moon’s razor-sharp, electrostatically-charged, insidiously-invasive soil. Created from eons of micrometeorite impacts, the stuff has built into berms and hills, lined craters and valleys across the lunar surface. Regolith can pile high and deep enough to bury the likes of a VIPER. So to ensure that the rover remains mobile, Andrew’s team taught it to “swim.”&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/b8ce3210-0c0a-11ec-92ca-bb32af3d6785" alt="VIPER" data-uuid="347e4060-46c1-385f-bd7b-e09c7c2e3529"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure><p>Under typical conditions, the VIPER’s wheels roll conventionally at the ends of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocker-bogie">rocker-bogie suspension system</a> at speeds approaching a blistering half-mile-per-hour (that’s 20cm/s). Since the rover is powered exclusively through solar energy with a 450W battery, rather than a handy radioactive core, “we need to be able to move in any direction at any time, independent of how [VIPER is] pointed,” Andrews explained. “That means we need to be able to crab walk. So, each of our four wheels has the ability to independently be steered.”</p><p>And when the rover finds itself mired in regolith, it can turn these wheels sideways acting as scoops to drag itself forward. What’s more, the suspension setup enables the rover to lift each wheel independently, like a foot. Combining the vertical movements with dragging action somehow resulted in the <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/8hSPD2Yn4PuUM/giphy.gif?cid=ecf05e47e8wm3a7p2b87c5vcybvcxf8sjgchg6mfxryw2ghe&amp;rid=giphy.gif&amp;ct=g">Shaq-esque shimmy</a>.</p><p>“We know we&#39;re going in and out of craters — and in fact we want to, because some of the areas where the water that can be found are going to be in very dark permanently shadowed craters — and because no robot or human has been down there, we don&#39;t exactly know what it&#39;s going to be like,” Andrews said. “So we needed to improve the capabilities of the rover to handle a lot of the unknown.”</p><p>The VIPER will not be driving blind, mind you. NASA is already hard at work producing a <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/ames/new-maps-help-viper-plan-lunar-road-trip">lunar road map</a> to help guide the rover on its journey. The 3D, meter-scale maps were created using NASA’s open source Stereo Pipeline software tool alongside its <a href="https://www.nas.nasa.gov/supercomputing/overview.html">Pleiades supercomputer</a> to assemble satellite images captured by the <a href="https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter</a> using a technique known as <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1975Icar...25..613W/abstract">photoclinometry</a>. With them, the VIPER will be less likely to fall into craters or tip head over wheels trying to climb a too-steep incline.</p><div id="f6dca73bc675422a8c6b147cb6e598d3"><iframe src="//dk79lclgtez2i.cloudfront.net/n7vBncv?card=1" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Unlike its Mars-based cousins, VIPER won’t have to rely nearly as heavily on automation thanks to its drastically shorter signal lag time — 6-10 seconds compared to the 15-20 minutes needed to talk to Mars. That’s still too long a delay to take control of the VIPER directly from Earth, but it will allow Mission Control to plot a series of <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/viper/lunar-operations">incremental 15-foot-long navigational waypoints</a>. “Once we pick the landing site... which will be in October,” Andrews said. “We&#39;re going to pick the optimal traverse plan for the rover to get as much science as we can out of it.”</p><p>After VIPER completes its mission, NASA researchers should have a much broader and more detailed view of where water deposits are located in the region. But what will happen to VIPER itself once its duties are done?</p><p>While the decision on that subject is still being debated by the VIPER team, Andrews points to two possible outcomes. We could drive the rover into the deepest, darkest crater it can find, consequences be damned, to see just what the heck is down there (<a href="https://twitter.com/Dustinkcouch/status/1057094474227240960">maybe ghosts!</a>). The other option would be to park it on the highest and best-lit mound of regolith we can find and hope that the rover can be revived after the region sinks into 6 to 9 months of complete darkness.</p><p>“NASA would then have to decide if it is worth them keeping the team going for that amount of time,” Andrews conceded, “so when the South Pole comes back into the sun, to try to somehow bring Viper back to life... Is it worth it to NASA, is it worth the money, to do that? Those are the trades that the agency is going to have to make.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nasas-first-lunar-rover-will-scour-the-moons-south-pole-for-water-in-2023-160022034-170003713.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">eaf9a154-6f8d-4fec-bde4-647b530cabfd</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 17:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630602294</ingested><modified>2021-09-02T17:05:00+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[Space & Astronomy]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d5f30590-0c0b-11ec-bdbd-a83be23843d7" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d5f30590-0c0b-11ec-bdbd-a83be23843d7" width="3840" height="2160" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[NASA&#39;s first lunar rover will scour the moon&#39;s south pole for water in 2023]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Battlefield Mobile' beta is coming to Android devices this fall]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Since April, we’ve known EA has been working on a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/battlefield-is-coming-to-mobile-in-a-new-standalone-game-130013439.html">standalone mobile version</a> of its popular Battlefield games it plans to release sometime in 2022.

That’s not ideal given the prevalence of droughts as climate change intensifies its work to wipe humanity from the face of the planet. That’s why Bosch, the German multinational which makes, uh, pretty much everything, has created FreshUp. It’s a tool designed to “refresh” your clothes without the need to dump them into your washing machine.</p><p>The idea is to remove odors from clothes that are otherwise clean, in the sense that they’re <em>not visibly stained</em>. You know, an evening gown or tuxedo that looks a million dollars but smells like the bottom of a well-visited ashtray, or that t-shirt that goes perfectly with your outfit, but smells a little bit sweaty. In those situations, you’d grab this doodad, rub it over the required garment and step out smelling fresh as a daisy.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>FreshUp is a lozenge-shaped device measuring 6.5-inches long, with a 2-inch treatment area on its underside. Once charged and turned on, you press this against your dry clothes so that the process of breaking down the smell can begin. It works as an ionizer, creating a plasma which Bosch says dissolves the connections between odor molecules.</p><p>There’s a beautiful design on the top that’s designed to resemble an interlacing series of magnetic field lines. This is backlit in white, and turns purple when it’s actually treating your clothes with its ionization. Despite the overall vibe that this is a product that fell out of a Sharper Image catalog twenty years ago, it’s impeccably designed. Thankfully, there are no “but wait, there’s more” innovations to add to the list of jobs this thing can do.</p><p>The battery takes around four hours to charge and will give you an hour of processing before it needs to go back on the wire. Bosch also chose a micro USB port for charging rather than USB-C, which is, you know, a choice you <em>can</em> make in 2021. But it’s not ideal if you’re trying to minimize cable clutter and are looking to ditch the older standard as soon as possible.</p><p>As soon as you’ve treated a garment with FreshUp, you’ll be acutely aware of the ionization in the air. It offers a similar smell to the taste you get in your mouth when you’ve bitten your tongue. That iron-in-the-blood scent that clings to your hand when you’ve held onto some loose change while waiting for a vending machine. And it doesn’t just sit on your clothes, but hangs in the air, where on very dry summer days you’ll want to make sure you leave your windows open to encourage airflow.</p><p>In its sales pitch, Bosch says that FreshUp was designed to eliminate what it describes as a “chair-drobe.” You know, that pile of clothes in your bedroom that maybe you drape over the back of a chair, or stuff on the bottom of your wardrobe, because they’re too clean to wash. I’m not a regular chair-drobe-ist, but the fan housing of my rowing machine is sturdy enough to drape clothes over on the rare occasions they wind up in this state. Bosch adds that, after treatment, “even tough odors such as cigarette smoke and body odor are removed, leaving clothes as if they have been hung outside to dry.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/d86671f0-0c8c-11ec-9e4b-62c3f45a848f" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Bosch FreshUp, a device designed to refresh clothes with plasma ionization, upside down on a desk." data-uuid="af3786c2-6725-39d0-9199-eb9c205108e0"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p>And here’s where I’ve really earned my wages over the last month or so, because I’ve spent a chunk of this summer sniffing awful things. Not to mention, of course, wearing already-worn clothes and spending way too long with my nose in my own armpit. I’ve been testing a high-intensity exercise bike and trying to be as active as possible, all the while getting my clothes covered in cigarette smoke and frying oil. Consider this a content warning for what is about to follow, as well as a polite request for danger pay.</p><p>There were plenty of smells that the FreshUp was able to dispel without breaking much of a sweat, including the cigarette smoke and fried food. It’s in this regard that makes me think that FreshUp is perfect for traveling, when you want to make sure that you’re looking and smelling your best. If your top smells like the inside of an ashtray, just waft this thing over it, hang it up for an hour or two, and boom, you’re away.</p><p>But no matter how much I rubbed this thing over the armpits of my well-worn t-shirts (after, I should make clear, the fabric had dried out) I could never banish the smell of my sweat. I tried everything, including leaving a t-shirt hanging up for a day or two and then treating it again, then leaving it to hang for another couple of hours, and nothing. The scent wasn’t eliminated, although I will say that it was moderated somewhat, but not enough to make you not deeply self-conscious about how you smell. But I did wonder if this was a “me” problem rather than Bosch’s, and so grabbed clothes from other family members. One of my relatives who went for a run handed me a pair of their socks which stank so bad that they probably violated chemical weapons laws.</p><p>And again, I’d like to reiterate that the time I spent dry-retching was all in the service of good journalism.</p><p>Once dried out, I treated those socks and found that, again, FreshUp hadn’t destroyed the smell, but it had reduced the urge to heave. That, broadly speaking, means that this is not going to be your savior if you’re schlepping around in a warm country.</p><p>But if you aren’t cursed with the blight of free-flowing underarms (or, in Richard Nixon’s case, upper lip) then I think FreshUp may have a place for you. I can think of some times where, after a long evening on assignment, I’d love to give my clothes an emergency refresh. If you’re doing two or three smart events back-to-back and can’t visit a dry cleaners, then FreshUp is probably a good shout, but the use cases are limited.</p><p>But don’t expect the results to be as good as washing, because fundamentally, nothing is going to be able to replace your washing machine just yet. And then there’s the price, which at <a href="https://www.bosch-home.co.uk/bosch-innovations/freshup-fabric-refresher">£250 ($342)</a> is a little high for a device that can’t revolutionize how you do laundry. At least, not yet.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bosch-freshup-clothes-refreshing-ionizing-wand-140044262.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">9d8acc08-374a-4863-bea5-07a10fd27352</guid><dc:creator>Daniel Cooper</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 14:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630676596</ingested><modified>2021-09-03T13:43:28+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Clothes & Apparel]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Daniel Cooper]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9f028520-0c8c-11ec-965f-e42c3ef3b4d0" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/9f028520-0c8c-11ec-965f-e42c3ef3b4d0" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Daniel Cooper]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Image of the Bosch FreshUp, a device designed to 'refresh' your clothes using  plasma ionization.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bosch FreshUp]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple is delaying its child safety features]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Apple says it&#39;s delaying the rollout of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-csam-detection-explainer-183029927.html">Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) detection tools</a> &quot;to make improvements&quot; following pushback from critics. The features include one that analyzes iCloud Photos for known CSAM, which has caused concern among privacy advocates.</p><p>“Last month we announced plans for features intended to help protect children from predators who use communication tools to recruit and exploit them, and limit the spread of Child Sexual Abuse Material,&quot; Apple told <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/03/apple-delays-csam-detection-feature/"><em>9to5Mac</em></a> in a statement. &quot;Based on feedback from customers, advocacy groups, researchers and others, we have decided to take additional time over the coming months to collect input and make improvements before releasing these critically important child safety features.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple planned to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-ios-15-193820644.html">roll out the CSAM detection systems</a> as part of upcoming OS updates, namely iOS 15, iPadOS 15, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watchos-8-beta-hands-on-175457215.html">watchOS 8</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/mac-os-monterey-preview-public-beta-175927010.html">macOS Monterey</a>. The company is expected to release those in the coming weeks. Apple didn&#39;t go into detail about the improvements it might make. Engadget has contacted the company for comment.</p><p>The planned features included one for Messages, which would notify children and their parents when Apple detects that sexually explicit photos were being shared in the app using on-device machine learning systems. Such images sent to children would be blurred and include warnings. Siri and the built-in search functions on iOS and macOS will direct point users to appropriate resources when someone asks how to report CSAM or tries to carry out CSAM-related searches.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/d4ff9d40-fb96-11eb-9eef-a4cc2fb18968" style="height:567;width:1030;" alt="Apple&#39;s new Messages feature for children will send warnings when sexually explicit images are sent or received. " data-uuid="4b2162e0-2b79-3ef5-9430-3a26a1a69efa"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Apple</div></figure><p>The iCloud Photos tool is perhaps the most controversial of the CSAM detection features Apple announced. It plans to use an on-device system to match photos against a database of known CSAM image hashes (a kind of digital fingerprint for such images) maintained by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other organizations. This analysis is supposed to take place before an image is uploaded to iCloud Photos. Were the system to detect CSAM and human reviewers manually confirmed a match, Apple would disable the person&#39;s account and send a report to NCMEC.</p><p>Apple claimed the approach would provide &quot;privacy benefits over existing techniques since Apple only learns about users’ photos if they have a collection of known CSAM in their iCloud Photos account.&quot; However, privacy advocates have been up in arms about the planned move.</p><p>Some suggest that CSAM photo scanning could lead to law enforcement or governments pushing Apple to look for other types of images to perhaps, for instance, clamp down on dissidents. Two Princeton University researchers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/princeton-university-researcher-apple-csam-oped-162004601.html">who say they built a similar system</a> called the tech &quot;dangerous.&quot; They wrote that, “Our system could be easily repurposed for surveillance and censorship. The design wasn’t restricted to a specific category of content; a service could simply swap in any content-matching database, and the person using that service would be none the wiser.”</p><p>Critics also called out Apple for apparently going against its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-05-apple-ces-2019-privacy-advertising.html"><ins>long-held stance</ins></a> of upholding user privacy. It famously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-18-fbi-apple-iphone-explainer.html"><ins>refused to unlock the iPhone</ins></a> used by the 2016 San Bernardino shooter, kicking off a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-02-18-fbi-apple-iphone-explainer.html"><ins>legal battle with the FBI</ins></a>.</p><p>Apple <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-on-confusion-over-child-safety-updates-csam-150121989.html">said in mid-August</a> that poor communication led to confusion about the features, which it announced just over a week beforehand. The company&#39;s senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi noted the image scanning system has &quot;multiple levels of auditability.&quot; Even so, Apple&#39;s rethinking its approach. It hasn&#39;t announced a new timeline for rolling out the features.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-child-safety-features-csam-delay-132534290.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c98b19f4-2776-4465-88cf-4e5f03e2c934</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 13:25:34 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630679259</ingested><modified>2021-09-03T14:27:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dede81d0-0cb9-11ec-bdff-0cd3c7db7c6e" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/dede81d0-0cb9-11ec-bdff-0cd3c7db7c6e" width="3000" height="1688" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[iPhone 12]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iPhone 12]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[JD.com removes 'Super Mario Maker 2,' 'FIFA 21' and 84 other games in China]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>China&#39;s second largest e-commerce platform JD.com will stop selling up to 86 games following a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/china-cuts-kids-gaming-time-132539606.html">crackdown</a> on gaming that limits children to three hours per week, the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3147453/jdcom-stops-selling-86-games-call-duty-super-mario-maker-2-its-online"><em>South China Morning Post</em></a> (<em>SCMP</em>) has reported. Popular titles being removed from its platform include <em>FIFA 21</em>, <em>The Last of Us 2</em> and <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this week, China&#39;s National Press and Publication Administration (NPAA) regulator issued an edict limiting gaming for kids under 18 to three hours of gaming per week. They&#39;re only allowed to play now for an hour every Friday, Saturday, Sunday and on statutory holidays, marking some of the governments strictest measures since a blockade on new approvals <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-12-21-china-resumes-game-approvals-to-the-delight-of-tencent.html">back in 2018</a>.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The new rule has a few gaping holes, notably that officials won&#39;t be able to monitor unlicensed games not officially in the system. It&#39;s difficult to see how officials would monitor offline gameplay, as well.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it&#39;s still a big shift in JD.com&#39;s strategy, as SCMP has noted. The company announced that it would ban any game that violates China&#39;s constitution or national security laws. That also includes games that might promote vulgarity, pornography, gambling and violence. (It&#39;s hard to see how some of those games like <em>FIFA 21</em> and <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> violate those rules.)</p><p>Previously, JD.com allowed sales of certain games that straddled or crossed those lines, banning them only when they stirred up controversy.

Many of this week&#39;s deals are still available right now, including Amazon&#39;s discount on the first- and second-generation Echo Show 5 smart displays and a $20 discount on Google&#39;s Nest Audio speaker. Plus, a bunch of new sales are running now through the holiday, including those on Dyson vacuums, OLED smart TVs, wireless earbuds and more. Here are the best Labor Day tech sales we could find.</p><h2>MacBook Air M1</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/c8aea820-28a0-11eb-9f89-5ddd62987703" alt="Apple MacBook Air M1" data-uuid="720a9600-0957-3d5e-9036-031264cc2d04"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple&#39;s MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3kLKtDj">Apple&#39;s MacBook Air M1</a> is back down to an all-time low of $850 thanks to an automatically applied coupon.

When the Apple Watch falls to this low of a price, it tends to go in and out of stock often (especially on Amazon), so we recommend grabbing it quickly if you&#39;re set on buying one. While the next-gen Apple Watch could debut this month, the Series 6 is the best model you can get right now and we gave it a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">score of 89</a> for its solid performance, improved battery life and useful hand-washing timer feature.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3yHZuv5" id="cae1c257ac7043719302f3821df2a073" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Series 6 (Product Red) at Amazon - $249</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/YgyAbJ" id="83069306a17843a28e7ab4baaa95509c" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Series 6 (Product Red) at Best Buy - $249</a><h2>AirPods Pro</h2><figure><img src="https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims?image_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fs.yimg.com%2Fos%2Fcreatr-uploaded-images%2F2020-05%2F62dce390-a1b4-11ea-b6ff-c327709bc1d2&amp;thumbnail=675%2C&amp;client=49kdj93ncb8s938hkdo&amp;signature=d29e5a72e403d5e45dbf804d4ed6fda688883cd6" data-uuid=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Apple&#39;s <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirPods Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3iKKAzf">AirPods Pro</a> are down to $190 right now, or $60 off their normal price.

In other words, it can tell how well your lungs are delivering oxygenated blood throughout your body. However, we were more impressed with its under-the-hood upgrades, as we mentioned in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-review-153047133.html">review</a> where we gave it a score of 89.</p><p>The model uses Apple&#39;s new S6 chip, resulting in a zippier performance compared to its predecessors. Apps launch more quickly and swiping through watchfaces feel faster, as well. It&#39;s also more energy efficient, which translates to longer battery life, and charges faster than the previous Watch generation. In addition, the device has all the features that come with watchOS 7, including a handwashing timer and a sleep tracker.</p><p>Only the 40mm GPS-only Product Red version is on sale at the moment, and you can&#39;t get the other colors for the same price. Product Red versions of Apple&#39;s devices are special, though, because the tech giant has been giving proceeds from their sales to the Global Fund&#39;s HIV/AIDS programs for over a decade now. The initiative&#39;s goal shifted last year due to the pandemic, and Apple announced that it will be donating &quot;100 percent of eligible proceeds&quot; from Product Red purchases to the Global Fund&#39;s COVID‑19 response efforts until December 30th, 2021.</p><p>Follow <a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals">@EngadgetDeals</a> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-watch-series-6-249-120556593.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af8d9e23-8def-458a-ad32-d7296423d4ae</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 12:05:56 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630673031</ingested><modified>2021-09-03T12:44:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2ac1f390-0c9f-11ec-943f-b5f4cf2b4c66" width="1600" height="1061" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/2ac1f390-0c9f-11ec-943f-b5f4cf2b4c66" width="1600" height="1061" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Dining in Gotham City]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Among all the themed restaurants and dining experiences in the world, Park Row, a new dining venture in London, tries to keep things a little classier than the rest.

It will now relaunch as Luminary, with an emphasis on beginning rather than professional musicians, the company said.&nbsp;</p><p>Luminary will be led by Roli founder and CEO Roland Lamb.

According to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-close-to-launching-its-own-tv-in-the-us-2021-9"><em>Insider</em></a>, the e-commerce giant is planning to launch its own TVs in the US as soon as October, just in time for the holiday shopping season. The project has reportedly been in development for almost two years by teams from Amazon Devices and Lab126, the R&amp;D division responsible for designing the company&#39;s products that include the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/kindle-display-cover-212808686.html">Kindle</a> and the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-07-12-amazon-higher-quality-echo-speaker-vesta-robot.html">Echo</a> speakers.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Insider</em> says, however, that the models expected to be launched in October were designed and manufactured by third parties like TCL. Amazon&#39;s in-house team is apparently working on a separate TV, though it&#39;s unclear if that will also be released in the US in the coming months. As for the third-party-made TVs, <em>Insider</em> says they&#39;re going to be powered by Alexa, as you&#39;d expect from Amazon-branded hardware. The publication didn&#39;t say, however, if they will also run the company&#39;s Fire TV software.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Amazon already sells TVs running Fire TV, but they still carry their manufacturers&#39; brands. These upcoming TVs will have Amazon branding even if they&#39;re made by third-party companies, similar to the AmazonBasics TVs the e-commerce giant sells in India. If you&#39;ll recall, the company <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-india-231557259.html">released</a> a 55-inch and a 50-inch model under the AmazonBasics brand in the country last year. The models planned for a US release will reportedly be in the range of 55 to 75 inches, though we&#39;ll have to wait for more information to find out whether they&#39;re also lower-cost models like the TVs released in India.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-branded-tv-us-051047163.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bf8f9117-1c1a-40e6-85b0-0cf21153c749</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 05:10:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1630645879</ingested><modified>2021-09-03T05:11:30+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/55651820-0c6d-11ec-97af-569031d68535" width="1240" height="781" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/55651820-0c6d-11ec-97af-569031d68535" width="1240" height="781" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Marvel's Midnight Suns' is a card-based tactical RPG]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When Firaxis <a href="https://www.engadget.com/marvels-midnight-suns-release-date-trailer-191236120.html"><ins>announced </ins><em><ins>Marvel’s Midnight Suns</ins></em></a> last week, the studio’s Jake Solomon promised the game would share “zero mechanics” with XCOM, but said little else about how its gameplay systems would work.

According to Solomon, battlefield terrain and the positioning of adversaries play a critical role in <em>Midnight Suns </em>since you force your opponents to collide with obstacles and each other to damage them. As you progress through the game, you’ll have the chance to upgrade your cards to make them more powerful and create new synergies between different heroes.</p><p>Following the reveal, Firaxis <a href="https://twitter.com/midnightsuns/status/1433146431171227648?s=20">clarified on Twitter</a> you won’t have to buy loot boxes or pay for any other microtransactions to unlock additional cards.
