That&#39;s why we recommend waiting for a sale like this one to pick up an extra drive, SD card and the like while you can get them for less. Samsung&#39;s T7 Touch is a palm-sized portable SSD with read speeds up to 1,050 MB/s and write speeds up to 1,000 MB/s, plus features like Dynamic Thermal Guard to control heat levels. While the drive supports optional password protection, the kicker here is its built-in fingerprint reader that you can use as an extra layer of security.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The T7 Touch&#39;s compact design helps it fit into nearly any bag you may be carrying, plus its shock- and drop-resistant aluminum unibody should protect it from too much damage if it accidentally takes a tumble.

But <a href="https://www.germanbionic.com/en/">German Bionic</a> claims only one of them is intelligent enough to learn from its users’ mistaken movements: its 5th-generation Cray X.</p><p>The Cray X fits on workers like a 7kg backpack with hip-mounted actuators that move carbon fiber linkages strapped to the upper legs, allowing a person to easily lift and walk with up to 30kg (66 lbs) with both their legs and backs fully supported. Though it doesn’t actively assist the person’s shoulders and arms with the task, the Cray X does offer a Smart Safety Companion system to help mitigate common lifting injuries.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“It&#39;s a real time software application that runs in the background and can warn the worker when the ergonomic risk is getting too high,” Norma Steller, German Bionic’s Head of IoT, told Engadget. “For example, recommending a break because we know that… the repetition and the overall stress can lead to fatigue, and fatigue can lead to injuries. This is something we want to prevent.”</p><p>The SSC not only collects granular telemetry information — what load is being lifted, ergonomic risks such as twisting while lifting, and potential environmental factors — it uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze that data to adapt the exoskeleton to the worker wearing it via OTA software updates. Not only is this data displayed to the workers themselves on an attached monitor, the Cray X also transmits that data up the supervisory chain allowing managers to monitor the movements of their employees to ensure that they are not overexerting themselves.</p><p>“Since we are collecting every single step and every single lift, the data that we provide is much more accurate,” Steller noted. The data the Cray collects is gathered from real-world use, not lab tests or supervised trials where workers are on their best ergonomic behavior. “Especially in logistics, every single step, every single lift, every single trend is usually planned. But sometimes in the real world, not every plan comes to fulfillment and then we suddenly see workplace performance drop very, very quickly. And with the data we provide, you can actually do an investigation and figure out why [that drop off is occurring].”</p><p>Steller sees the Cray X as a &quot;preventative device&quot; designed to ensure workers don&#39;t overextend or overexert themselves. “We are a preventative device, so we are preventing injury,” Steller added. “We&#39;re not considered a medical [device manufacturer]. We consider ourselves an exoskeleton for industrial use.” As such, the Cray X is <a href="https://www.coolstuffshub.com/ip-rating-guide/#:~:text=A%20product%20with%20an%20IP54,of%20water%20from%20any%20angle.">IP54 rated</a> for dust and moisture so it can work in all but the dingiest of warehouse environments.</p><p>And though the Cray X is designed to be put on and taken off in under a minute, it can be worn for up to a full work shift without being removed thanks to the 5th generation’s new hot-swappable 40V battery system.</p><p>“We implemented the hot swapping function so that you can just drop it on the spot without having to turn off the device,” Mauris Kiss, Head of Mechanical R&amp;D at German Bionic, told Engadget. “You can pull out the [spent battery] for a new one, place the old one on the charger — we use the Makita fast charging stations which charge the battery in like 30 to 40 minutes — and then you can just move on. You could potentially work like eight hours without having to take off the exoskeleton.”</p><p>For as useful as the current generation of exoskeletal technologies are today, the German Bionic team sees them becoming even more capable, and widespread, in the years ahead. “My feeling is that we will see much more specialized exoskeletons in the future because the technology is more available.” Steller said. “I think they will enter our world, not only in the B2B industrial sectors. We will see them basically everywhere because we have the chance to augment our body and usually humans take the chance to do that. We will see them everywhere, without any real limitation but very specialized to the use case.”</p><p>“I really see everyone on the street wearing an exoskeleton in one form or another,” Eric Eitel, German Bionic’s Head of Communications, added. “But I think that the exoskeletons that we are looking for in the future are the active ones. I see them being a lot slimmer, smarter and connected.”</p><p>And even as the technology expands to consumer uses, Eitel believes exoskeletons will likely remain a common sight in industrial settings. “There are still a lot of workspaces that cannot be automated and I think that&#39;s going to stay like that for a long time. You still have to rely on people so we don&#39;t want to replace all the humans. I really see that technology is going alongside [automation].”</p><p>“We see robots more as companions, our product is actually a companion,” added Kiss. “I think this can be just another possibility, I mean, there&#39;s still situations where automation still makes a lot of sense. When you go into dangerous environments, you should actually automate that. But why should we automate everything?”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/german-bionic-cray-x-5th-gen-exoskeleton-connectivity-future-of-robotics-140023476.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3b1979b0-3bc3-42d8-82fd-9513a47092e1</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 14:00:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642772356</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T13:39:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/86a61110-78a5-11ec-bce7-f81f2b37db8d" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/86a61110-78a5-11ec-bce7-f81f2b37db8d" width="2048" height="1152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[German Bionic]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[German Bionic's Cray X exoskeleton]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[German Bionic's Cray X exoskeleton]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Engadget Podcast: James Webb’s eye in the stars, Microsoft buys Activision]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Now that the James Webb Space Telescope is safely on the way to its orbital home, Cherlynn and Devindra chat about why it’s so important with <a href="https://www.space.com/"><ins>Space.com</ins></a> editor-in-chief Tariq Malik, as well as science and technology journalist <a href="https://www.swapnakrishna.com/"><ins>Swapna Krishna</ins></a>.

It wasn&#39;t exactly due to the content of their videos, however, but because some of the group&#39;s members were <a href="https://www.engadget.com/oath-keepers-leader-charged-capitol-breach-211007516.html">charged</a> with seditious conspiracy over their role in the January 6th, 2021 US Capitol breach. One of the deactivated channels was named &quot;Oath Keepers&quot; and had fewer than 45,000 subscribers, while the other belonged to group leader Stewart Rhodes and had fewer than 20 subscribers. Rhodes (pictured above) was arrested for his role in the attack and was one of the members who were charged.</p><p>YouTube spokesperson Ivy Choi told <em>Axios</em> that the channels broke the platform&#39;s creator responsibility guidelines. According to those guidelines, YouTube may terminate a channel if there&#39;s &quot;significant evidence presented in a court of law against a creator for a very egregious crime&quot; and that channel&#39;s &quot;YouTube comment is closely related to the crime.&quot; YouTube said that the termination &quot;follows evidence presented in federal indictments against the Oath Keepers and the charges against them and their role in the Jan. 6 attacks.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to the Justice Department, the Oath Keepers discussed their plans to seize the Capitol building using encrypted messaging apps and social networks. The group has long used online platforms to disseminate information, including COVID-19 conspiracy theories with QAnon hashtags and threats of violence.

The doctors have transplanted kidneys from a genetically altered pig into the abdomen of a brain-dead man, and as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/20/health/transplants-pig-human-kidney.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> has reported, the procedure was described in a paper published in the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajt.16930">American Journal of Transplantation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the doctors, the kidneys from the pig started producing urine as soon as 23 minutes after the procedure and continued to do so for three days. The patient&#39;s kidneys were fully removed, and his body didn&#39;t show signs of rejecting the transplanted organs. This is the latest in a series of developments wherein  organs from genetically altered pigs were successfully transplanted into humans. In late 2021, NYU Langone Health doctors <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/19/health/kidney-transplant-pig-human.html">attached</a> a pig kidney onto the blood vessels of a brain-dead patient&#39;s upper leg. And, just a few days ago, doctors at the University of Maryland School of Medicine <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pig-heart-transplant-successful-224645097.html">transplanted</a> a pig&#39;s heart into a live patient as part of an experimental procedure.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The UAB surgeons performed the procedure with consent from the family of the recipient, James Parsons, who wanted to be an organ donor. They&#39;re now naming this type of study after him. While the recipient was brain dead in this case, it&#39;s a big step toward a clinical trial involving live patients that they&#39;re hoping would start later this year. Dr. Jayme Locke, the team&#39;s lead surgeon, said this wasn&#39;t a one-off experiment, and that the hope is to &quot;advance the field to help... patients.&quot; The doctor who serves as director to UAB&#39;s Incompatible Kidney Transplant Program added: &quot;What a wonderful day it will be when I can walk into clinic and know I have a kidney for everyone waiting to see me.&quot;</p><p>Based on data from the <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/">Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network</a>, there are currently 90,272 people on the waiting list for kidney transplant. In addition, around 3,000 new patients are <a href="https://www.kidney.org/news/newsroom/factsheets/Organ-Donation-and-Transplantation-Stats#:~:text=The%20median%20wait%20time%20for,compatibility%20and%20availability%20of%20organs.&amp;text=In%202014%2C%2017%2C107%20kidney%20transplants,5%2C537%20came%20from%20living%20donors.">added</a> to the waiting list for the organ each month. Dr. Locke said &quot;kidney failure is refractory, severe and impactful&quot; and that &quot;it needs a radical solution.&quot; She hopes to be able to offer life-saving pig kidney transplants to patients within the next five years.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/implant-genetically-altered-pig-kidneys-brain-dead-patient-120509525.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8babcf45-7044-422e-b242-1113ccbeca40</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 12:05:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642776028</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T14:41:01+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Tests & Procedures]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cd509130-7aa3-11ec-bf3f-6a6f1ae49f84" width="8192" height="5464" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/cd509130-7aa3-11ec-bf3f-6a6f1ae49f84" width="8192" height="5464" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[South_agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Group of surgeons performing surgery on a patient in operating room.

It can&#39;t handle 4K like the Xbox Series X or PS5, but refresh rate is a more important issue for most gamers. You also get dramatically faster load times thanks to Microsoft&#39;s new Xbox Velocity architecture and custom 512GB SSD, though the relatively paltry storage might be an issue for some users.&nbsp;</p><p>Lack of storage aside, the Xbox Series S is already one of the best console deals out there, and even more so at the discounted $280 price. You&#39;d better act quickly if you want one, however, as the deal will disappear within 24 hours or when stock sells out, whichever comes first.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-xbox-series-s-is-7-percent-off-at-woot-111706252.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d5d340dc-dcea-422c-9fad-9be968aed13c</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 11:17:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642768043</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T12:27:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Game Consoles]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/754e8fa0-7aa8-11ec-b3db-f57bc08e7b47" width="2000" height="1344" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/754e8fa0-7aa8-11ec-b3db-f57bc08e7b47" width="2000" height="1344" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The Xbox Series S is 7 percent off at Woot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[The Xbox Series S is 7 percent off at Woot ]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blizzard chief promises to 'rebuild trust' ahead of Microsoft takeover]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blizzard Entertainment boss Mike Ybarra has <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23763775/putting-our-teams-and-players-at-the-forefront-of-everything-we-do">promised in a blog post</a> to &quot;rebuild your trust&quot; in the studio, marking his first comments since Microsoft&#39;s proposed <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-133637845.html">$68.7 billion acquisition</a> of Blizzard Activision. The developer of blockbuster titles like <em>World of Warcraft</em> and <em>Overwatch</em> has been under pressure since it was sued by the state of California, which accused it of being a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women.&quot;</p><p>Ybarra promised new measures to improve the company&#39;s culture, starting with tying executive and management compensation to &quot;our overall success in creating a safe, inclusive and creative work environment at Blizzard,&quot; he said. He also outlined new roles designed to address discrimination and other issues, including:&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;A Culture leader who will help us maintain the best aspects of what we have today, and change and evolve where needed to ensure everyone brings their best self to Blizzard; a new organizational leader for Human Resources who will build trust, empower our teams, and help foster a safe, positive work environment for everyone; [and] a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&amp;I) leader solely focused on our progress across multiple efforts in this area.&quot;</p><div id="1bf5606dc4a843d7b951978594cac564"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;re committed to more open dialog directly with the amazing player communities - not just from me but from all of our incredible teams. <a href="https://t.co/5MUILlUCnS">https://t.co/5MUILlUCnS</a></p>— Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1484296085526827011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2022</a></blockquote></div><p>He said the company has tripled the size of its compliance and investigation teams, shared representation data internally, and created an &quot;upward feedback program&quot; to help employees evaluate managers.

It&#39;s still not clear if embattled CEO Bobbie Kotick will remain with the studio, or for how long.

Intel&#39;s initial plans include building two semiconductor fabrication plants (or fabs) on the property that would employ 3,000 people. Construction on the site is scheduled to begin this year, and Intel expects the fabs to be operational by 2025.</p><p>A <em>Bloomberg</em> report back in late 2021 claimed that the White House &quot;<a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-white-house-discouraged-intel-chip-factory-161435175.html">strongly discouraged</a>&quot; Intel from ramping up chip production in China. The administration has been pushing for companies to manufacture chips in the US in order to address the ongoing global shortage. In turn, companies have been lobbying the president to fund semiconductor research and manufacturing. It&#39;s worth noting, though, that since building new plants takes years, projects like this won&#39;t be able to help address supply chain shortages anytime soon.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Intel said it looked at 38 different sites in the US for the facility but ultimately chose Ohio, because of all the space it could use. The company doesn&#39;t want to build in places where it could displace residents, since that&#39;s what ultimately <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-02-14-amazon-cancels-new-york-hq2.html">killed</a> Amazon&#39;s plans to build a second headquarters in NYC. When the fabs are done, Intel will use them to manufacture both its own chips and chips for clients under the Intel Foundry Services. The company announced its foundry services when it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-7nm-2023-meteor-lake-213933055.html">revealed</a> that it&#39;s building two factories in Arizona, which will also cost Intel $20 billion, back in March 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Gelsinger, the chipmaker has the option to expand the Ohio site to 2,000 acres and to build as many as eight fabs in the future. &quot;We helped to establish the Silicon Valley,&quot; the CEO told <em>Time</em>. &quot;Now we’re going to do the Silicon Heartland.&quot;</p><p><strong>Update 01/21/22 3:45PM ET:</strong> Intel has officially published a press release confirming that it&#39;s building a new &quot;mega-site&quot; in Ohio. The whole project, if the company decides to expand its initial plans and build more fabs, could be worth up to $100 billion over the next decade.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/intel-ichip-making-facility-in-ohio-073608482.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0497dfc8-b03c-4ed1-b0a8-94f5f2578de4</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 07:36:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642760666</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T10:24:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Finance Trading]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/92d01e60-7a83-11ec-bfab-5bf52a37bae7" width="1600" height="1016" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/92d01e60-7a83-11ec-bfab-5bf52a37bae7" width="1600" height="1016" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Intel]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instagram will now reduce the visibility of 'potentially harmful' content]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Instagram is taking new steps to make <a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/how-we-address-harmful-content-on-feed"><ins>“potentially harmful”</ins></a> content less visible in its app. The company says that the algorithm powering the way posts are ordered in users’ feeds and in Stories will now de-prioritize content that “may contain bullying, hate speech or may incite violence.”</p><p>While Instagram’s rules already prohibit much of this type of content, the change could affect borderline posts, or content that hasn’t yet reached the app’s moderators. “To understand if something may break our rules, we&#39;ll look at things like if a caption is similar to a caption that previously broke our rules,” the company explains in an update.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Up until now, Instagram has tried <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-and-instagram-reveal-content-recommendation-guidelines-130011327.html"><ins>to hide</ins></a> potentially objectionable content from public-facing parts of the app, like Explore, but hasn’t changed how it appears to users who follow the accounts posting this type of content.

Specifically, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-06-lioness-2-ai-orgasm-vibrator-data-collection-ces-2020.html">Lioness smart vibrator</a>, which gathers bio-data like body temperature and pelvic pressure. Liemhetcharat said she was partly inspired by the <a href="https://perifit.co/">Perifit</a> kegel exerciser, which also uses games and a device to help people strengthen their pelvic floor. The game, an endless runner called <em>You Are What You Eat</em>, has been in beta since then. Today, Liemhetcharat has released the Android version, which you can now <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AtasFun.YouAreWhatYouEatLioness">download from the Google Play Store</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Liemhetcharat told Engadget that <em>You Are What You Eat</em> is based on her family&#39;s favorite activity. &quot;Our running joke is that we eat everything,&quot; she said. By itself, the game is an endless runner, with the objective of eating as many creatures as possible before dying. You begin as a blob, then grow and morph depending on what you ingest. That will also affect what you can continue to consume, as some creatures will subsequently become &quot;inedible&quot; based on what you&#39;ve become. A <a href="https://allisonliem.org/youarewhatyoueat/lioness_1d28/">WebGL version of the game</a> is available.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="8da3b4d368e64ed1beffa37dbc2ebf8c"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gTmYVeCyw2I?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>But for those who own the Lioness smart vibrator, you can use it to control your slimeball. Squeeze the dildo&#39;s head (where the pressure sensors are) to jump, and do that twice to fly or jump twice. The device will also vibrate in response when you do those things or eat something.</p><p>Those on iOS won&#39;t be left out — Liemhetcharat told Engadget that a version for the iPhone is coming soon, too. So far, the game itself is simple, but the most intriguing aspect is its use of the bio-sensing vibrator as a controller. As a proof of concept, <em>YAWYE</em> is fairly straightforward, though we&#39;ll have to wait for medical professionals to weigh in before we can say with any certainty if it can be helpful in strengthening pelvic floor muscles.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/you-are-what-you-eat-lioness-smart-vibrator-game-223046404.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">83c794f4-5357-4d65-abf7-ba42ffb6e19b</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 22:30:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642718875</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T07:25:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e63ad8a0-7a3e-11ec-affb-5634e936248e" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e63ad8a0-7a3e-11ec-affb-5634e936248e" width="1280" height="720" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Allison Liemhetcharat]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A screenshot from the game "You Are What You Eat" featuring some trees, two pink creatures on the bottom left and the words "This creature has ears, so you will grow ears when you eat it" at the top.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[You Are What You Eat game screenshot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[NASA's Swift Observatory may have suffered an attitude control failure]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>NASA&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/first-fast-radio-burst-in-milky-way-002145743.html">Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory</a> has run into difficulties after 17 years of largely smooth service.

They not only have to measure their blood glucose levels and inject the right amount of insulin, but carry all the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-27-apple-diabetes-products-in-stores.html">relevant equipment</a> with them. MIT and Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital researchers might soon eliminate many of the headaches, though. They&#39;re <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2022/all-one-diabetes-insulin-0120">developing</a> all-in-one devices (not pictured) that measure glucose, calculate the necessary insulin dose and inject you accordingly.</p><p>The first device includes the blood-drawing lancet, glucose test strips and an insulin needle. Users would first take a photo of their meal using a smartphone app to estimate the food volume and carbohydrate levels. After that, they&#39;d start the automated process of collecting blood, calculating glucose (again through the app) and delivering the appropriate amount of insulin.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The second gadget would only need one needle jab — it would build the glucose sensor into the insulin needle and inject the appropriate amount of insulin. You&#39;d have to wait five to ten seconds, but you wouldn&#39;t have to stick yourself twice.</p><p>The technology is still some ways off. While the first device would use parts that were already FDA-approved, it hasn&#39;t been tested in humans. The second, meanwhile, uses a new sensor type that will likely require more work to be testable with humans. Scientists have filed patents for both devices and are hoping to work with companies on further development.</p><p>There&#39;s a strong motivation to bring these devices to market, at least. People with diabetes would only need to use one device at meals, and with the hybrid sensor/needle might suffer less pain. That, in turn, could encourage consistent treatment that improves your overall wellbeing.</p><div id="0ec4baba0b224944b492478db00574c7"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yMSgdLa4aYs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/mit-diabetes-device-blood-glucose-insulin-injection-205524756.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1005f400-8d26-4493-85cc-2f2beb0eae69</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 20:55:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642716081</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T07:25:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Diabetes]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f024cea0-7a27-11ec-97d7-a1c076c0aef1" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f024cea0-7a27-11ec-97d7-a1c076c0aef1" width="7952" height="5304" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[JGalione via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Woman wearing a glucose sensor checking her blood sugar level using a smartphone app. Tottori, Japan]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Woman wearing a glucose sensor checking her blood sugar level using a smartphone app]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[TikTok joins Instagram in testing creator subscriptions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Soon after Instagram started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-creator-subscriptions-test-193856198.html"><ins>rolling out paid subscriptions</ins></a> for creators, TikTok says it may be <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/20/tiktok-begins-testing-support-for-paid-subscriptions/"><ins>following suit</ins></a>.

He noted the accounts spent considerable time posting about their “side interests,” like football, in an attempt to boost their credibility. Some of the accounts also lifted profile photos from real celebrities or media personalities, and regularly updated the images in order to appear more real. Other accounts used fake photos generated by AI programs.</p><p>Overall, Facebook says that the fake accounts weren’t particularly successful as the most popular account had only reached about 4,000 followers, about half of whom were actually located in the UK. “In a way, this is more like an old fashioned pre-internet influence operation, creating detailed fake personas and trying not to be noticed,” Nimmo said.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-cib-report-iran-scotland-fake-accounts-190006227.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">524815a0-2635-4906-b429-b55cc8b646b5</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 19:00:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642707869</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T19:44:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/22b22620-7a22-11ec-b54e-36d4444a3caa" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/22b22620-7a22-11ec-b54e-36d4444a3caa" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this photo illustration a Facebook logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen with a computer keyword in the background in Athens, Greece on January 18, 2022.

Senators Mike Lee, John Cornyn, Ben Sasse, Tom Cotton, Thom Tillis, and Marsha Blackburn <a href="https://twitter.com/leah_nylen/status/1484225457834926082?cxt=HHwWhIC9zZXMg5kpAAAA">all voted against it</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/2992/text">The American Innovation and Choice Online Act</a>, which was sponsored by Senator Amy Klobuchar, would prohibit Amazon from promoting its own Amazon Basics gear over similar products in search results. Similarly, Apple and Google would be barred from pushing their in-house apps over those from third-party developers in their respective app stores. The bill passed out of both the antitrust subcommittee and the primary judiciary committee with the support of that vote and will now be put forth on the Senate floor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unsurprisingly, the platforms impacted by these proposed regulations are none too pleased with the recent proceedings. Apple&#39;s Tim Cook <a href="https://macdailynews.com/2022/01/18/apple-ceo-tim-cook-personally-lobbying-against-the-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act/">has reportedly been personally lobbying against the bill</a> while <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-statement-on-american-innovation-and-choice-online-act">Amazon has released the following statement</a>:</p><blockquote><p>There’s a reason why small businesses who sell on Amazon are asking Congress to take a look at the “collateral damage” that will fall on them and their customers, should the American Innovation and Choice Online Act become law. This bill is being rushed through the legislative process without any acknowledgment by its authors of its unintended consequences. As drafted, the bill’s vague prohibitions and unreasonable financial penalties—up to 15% of U.S. revenue, not income—would jeopardize our ability to allow small businesses to sell on Amazon. The bill would also make it difficult for us to guarantee one or two-day shipping for those small businesses&#39; products—key benefits of Amazon Prime for sellers and customers alike. The bill’s authors are targeting common retail practices and, troublingly, appear to single out Amazon while giving preferential treatment to other large retailers that engage in the same practices. We urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to reject Senator Klobuchar and Senator Grassley’s bill and refuse to rush through an ambiguously worded bill with significant unintended consequences.</p></blockquote><p>A similar bill has already passed the judiciary committee&#39;s counterpart in the House though the President has not yet weighed in regarding his support of these proposals.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/senator-klobuchars-major-tech-reform-bill-advances-out-of-committee-185350924.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">476e5438-b427-487c-961c-307dc355c459</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:53:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642720806</ingested><modified>2022-01-20T23:20:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[Legislative Branch]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f02c7fb0-7a3b-11ec-bf37-ae6fc87697a9" width="3000" height="1943" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f02c7fb0-7a3b-11ec-bf37-ae6fc87697a9" width="3000" height="1943" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[ELIZABETH FRANTZ via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Senator Klobuchar sits behind a microphone at an official hearing.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Senator Klobuchar]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[New 'Wallace & Gromit' and 'Chicken Run' movies are coming to Netflix]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a hiatus of more than a decade, the world’s favorite fictitious British inventor (or possibly second after Q from James Bond) and his lovable canine sidekick are making a comeback.

Gone are the days of the beloved CZ series, while the current lineup lacks the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-12-04-casio-and-the-sleng-teng-riddim.html">lo-fi charm</a> of classic keyboards like the SK-1 and VL-1. But for the last few weeks the company has been <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/casio-new-synth-2022">teasing</a> what seemed like a return to real-deal synths, possibly with a <a href="https://musictech.com/news/gear/casios-new-aix-powered-synth-could-feature-a-vocoder-too/">vocoder</a>.</p><p>Well, bad news: The <a href="https://www.casiomusicgear.com/products/casiotone-series/ct-s1000v">CT-S1000V</a> is not a return to Casio’s analog glory days. Nor is it a vocoder. And the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:$450" href="https://fave.co/3fFU38P">$450</a> list price is a little hard to swallow.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="undefined"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nassE9xtaXc?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>So what exactly is the CT-S1000V? It looks like a midrange Casiotone that uses the company’s flagship AiX engine, with vocal synthesis tossed in as a bonus. In short, it’s a singing keyboard. Frankly, the novelty of being able to whip up some lyrics in the companion app, send them to the CT-S1000V, and then play the words as a melody was more than enough to pique my interest. I’m a sucker for vocoders, over-the-top autotune and talkboxes, so a singing synth is right up my alley.</p><p>Before we dig too far into the vocal synthesis side of things, let’s quickly cover the AiX engine and the hardware. AiX made its debut in 2018 and its strength supposedly lies in recreating acoustic sounds. And look, credit where credit is due: The piano sounds on this are pretty decent. Can I say the same about the other acoustic instruments represented here, like violins, guitars or trumpets? No. But there are enough quality sounds, including some recreations of classic Casio synth tones, to keep you entertained for a while.</p><p>Don’t come to the S1000V expecting a truly customizable synth, though. While there are some tweaks that you can make, this is not the keyboard for someone looking to learn synthesis or get into sound design. That should be immediately obvious, however, when you look at its front panel. The controls are minimal. Physically it has much more in common with the $250 <a href="https://fave.co/3InF5k1">CT-S400</a> than it does with the $480 <a href="https://fave.co/3qNwxNz">CT-X5000</a> (the closest Casio has to a traditional synth).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb83c70-7a18-11ec-a674-7ba39da5099e" alt="Casiotone CT-S1000V" data-uuid="1f20bb69-53dc-3970-b6b2-b8ac5b470412"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>I haven’t played a modern Casio in some time, but I do have to say, the speaker system is impressive. Because the CT-S1000V is clearly aimed at budding pianists and home entertainment, being self-contained is a huge plus. While the built-in speakers on other keyboards often seem like an afterthought, Casio clearly put effort into them here. When you switch over to the drum and rhythm presets, it’s really quite shocking how much bass you get from the kicks.</p><p>On the whole, the CT-S1000V feels well built. It’s plasticky and the full-sized keys are a tad springy, but it feels solid and the click wheel that serves as your primary tool for navigating the interface is satisfying. Casio did make some strange decisions, though. For instance, the mod knob above the pitch wheel. Mod wheels and mod strips? Sure. But a mod knob? In this configuration, where the placement would suggest it’s a performance tool, seems <em>very </em>odd.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb7c741-7a18-11ec-abcf-29f7ddc464f8" alt="Casiotone CT-S1000V" data-uuid="fc4de7ae-6f53-354d-ac85-2e894cdd7533"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>The keyboard also comes with a Bluetooth adapter in the box, but it can only be used for streaming audio and MIDI data. It can’t connect to the companion Lyric Creator app. There are no dedicated MIDI ports on the back and, while it can supposedly be used for MIDI over USB I was unable to get it to work. There are, however, two pedal inputs on the back (one of which can be used for expression), plus ¼-inch stereo audio outs and ⅛-inch jacks for audio in and headphones. There’s also a pair of USB ports: one USB-A specifically for the Bluetooth adapter and a micro-USB (sigh) connector for transferring lyrics from the app on your phone.</p><p>The app is very well designed and thorough, and lyric transfers over USB using a camera kit adapter with my aging iPhone X were almost instantaneous. Casio says transfer over Bluetooth isn’t supported because it would simply be too slow, but just having it as an option would be nice.</p><p>In the app you can either type out or dictate phrases and it will do its best to automatically parse the text. Your mileage may vary, though. Computers aren’t always the best at reproducing human pronunciation and the CT-S1000V is no different. For example, “Engadget” was automatically broken down as “en-gadget”. But when the keyboard sang it back, it became “engage.” I had to go in and manually tweak the lyric to be “En-gad-jet” for it to sound right.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb81560-7a18-11ec-accf-745c2d5407ec" alt="Casiotone CT-S1000V" data-uuid="d4e8d6de-6ab3-353d-9fe2-12ee2417cdd5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>You can really dive deep and customize the phonemes if you want, and punch in specific timings using standard music notation. But there’s no avoiding the fact that getting lyrics to sound right requires a lot of trial and error, which would be less of an issue if you could preview the rendered vocals on your phone before transferring them to the keyboard. Right now it’s just a lot of back and forth.</p><p>On the keyboard itself, you have two primary ways of playing back lyrics: Either in Phrase mode or in Note mode as individual syllables. The former will play back the words using the timing you programmed in. As long as you&#39;re holding keys down, it will sing the lyrics to you. The one issue here is that playback will start over from the beginning if you ever let go of the keys. With syllable playback you have more control over timing and it’s a bit easier to knock out a melody (at least for someone like me who can’t really play piano). But it’s still important that your syllables be broken down just right or the timing will be off when you try to play back a vocal lick.</p><p>There are 22 different voices for you to pick between that range from synthetic choirs, to demonic growls, to talkbox emulations. Some of them get pretty same-sounding, but the variety is welcome. There are a few ways to tweak the voices, including changing the “age” and “gender”, though they dramatically alter the core tone of each.</p><section data-eng-breakout="6d65f6bcd662452b9604e0439139710a" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb83c71-7a18-11ec-9bef-0a1b59de16b2" alt="Casiotone CT-S1000V"></section><p>One last feature worth mentioning is the S1000V’s sampling capabilities. There are two different sampling modes: melody and drum. The latter lets you assign samples to individual keys to create custom drum kits. It’s also probably the easiest of the sampling methods to use. Melody, on the other hand, lets you play back a single sample chromatically across the keyboard by slowing it down or speeding it up. This latter trick is a fun and simple way to create custom instruments, and it’s part of what gave Casio’s SK series its charm.</p><p>But it’s worth noting that the sampling process here is slightly more cumbersome than on those old-school instruments. There’s no dedicated sampling controls on the front, you have to do a little menu diving. And there’s no built-in microphone for quick and dirty recording, you need to use the ⅛-inch jack around back, or a Bluetooth connection. It’s a nice tool to have, but I do wish it were featured more prominently and the interface a little less obtuse.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb7c740-7a18-11ec-adf6-4f0f8ee63f52" alt="Casiotone CT-S1000V" data-uuid="724e0a88-1a44-3c94-b469-4c58dfdcfb8b"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Casio deserves credit for doing something somewhat unique in building a singing keyboard. Sure, it’s a bit gimmicky to type out (or dictate) your favorite song and then play it back using a synthesized choir. But it’s undeniably fun. And including the ability to record custom samples, and layer them with the keyboard’s built-in sounds is a welcome feature.</p><p>It’s hard to overlook the $450 price, though, especially considering the limited sound design controls. The CT-S1000V is probably best suited for someone learning to play piano who wants a <em>fun</em> keyboard with a bit of versatility to practice on. But its price is a bit steep for what feels like mid-range Casiotone. You can get a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/roland-sp-404-mkii-hands-on-dragging-an-iconic-sampler-into-the-modern-age-070043439.html">more capable sampler</a> for around the same price, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/arturia-microfreak-vocoder-synthesizer-limited-edition-220640296.html">Arturia&#39;s MicroFreak</a> delivers limited vocal synthesis and a real vocoder for less. Obviously, the Casio has advantages over those — quality built-in speakers, expansive full-sized keyboard — but you&#39;ll have to decide how much those features are worth in terms of tradeoffs and price.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/casio-casiotone-ct-s1000v-fun-singing-keyboard-hands-on-181016051.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5c5c422e-f9b8-4ce5-a4b7-fa98bec236d5</guid><dc:creator>Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien,Terrence O&amp;#39;Brien</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jan 2022 18:10:16 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642702252</ingested><modified>2022-01-21T07:25:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Terrence O&#39;Brien]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb6dce0-7a18-11ec-9ea7-eb94118ac2b7" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/0bb6dce0-7a18-11ec-9ea7-eb94118ac2b7" width="2000" height="1126" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Terrence O'Brien / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Casiotone CT-S1000V]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Casiotone CT-S1000V]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
