The policy will reportedly apply to stores in Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Louisiana, New Jersey and New York before spreading to other states and shops. Apple has declined to comment.</p><p>The company is lifting the requirements due to declining COVID-19 case numbers and improving vaccination rates, according to the memo. The policy will apply regardless of a customer&#39;s vaccination status, although retail staff will still have to wear masks due to longer interactions and closer contact. Stores will still require masks for everyone in areas where the local government demands the safety measure, such as in Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The company has frequently changed its retail policies as the pandemic has evolved. It has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-closes-stores-in-california-and-the-uk-as-covid-19-cases-soar-083013840.html">closed</a> and reopened stores based on case levels, for instance. It scrapped the mask requirement in many US stores in June only to bring them back a month later.</p><p>Provided the leak is accurate, it&#39;s far too soon to say whether or not this policy shift will stick. The pandemic hasn&#39;t been entirely predictable, to put it mildly. However, a change in mask requirements would certainly reflect Apple&#39;s hopes of returning to pre-pandemic conditions as soon as possible, both in stores and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-return-to-office-092520216.html">in the office</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-lifts-mask-requirements-in-some-us-stores-205206291.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">91c475ee-daa4-48b5-8c47-a5706f5919e9</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 20:52:06 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636059128</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T20:52:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Professional Services]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/904900b0-3dae-11ec-ba8f-d51a04c36a8f" width="6576" height="4384" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/904900b0-3dae-11ec-ba8f-d51a04c36a8f" width="6576" height="4384" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Genaro Molina via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BEVERLY HILLS, CA - OCTOBER 08, 2020 - A customer service representative works with customers at the Apple store as shoppers return to indoor shopping after Los Angeles County eased restrictions at places like the Beverly Center in Beverly Hills on October 8, 2020.

It just might. Porsche is developing a &quot;digital twin&quot; (that is, a virtual copy) that helps predict service requirements based on driving styles. Algorithms can parse a combination of sensor data and &quot;big data&quot; to recommend service based on your driving style. You may need early work on your suspension if you take your car to the track, or the engine if you have a long highway commute.</p><p>The system can even anticipate faults before they happen. That will please mechanics, of course, but it could also keep you safe (and spare you additional repair costs) by scheduling maintenance long before there&#39;s a crisis.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Porsche doesn&#39;t officially launch its first digital twin until 2022, and then only using sensor data. Field testing is already underway however — about half of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-15-porsche-taycan-first-drive.html">Taycan</a> owners have volunteered for a pilot that anonymously monitors the EV&#39;s air suspension for body acceleration. If the car ventures past certain thresholds, the vehicle tells the driver they may need to visit a repair shop.</p><p>The twin system would let automakers ditch fixed maintenance schedules in favor of driver-specific recommendations. Porsche also envisions the algorithms helping even when your car is running flawlessly. You&#39;d have a digital record that could both suggest an accurate selling price for a used car as well as greater transparency for would-be buyers. Car brands could even pitch extended warranties based on the status of your car. So long as companies take privacy into account, though, this could save you more than a little stress (and moments of sheer panic) on the road.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/porsche-digital-twin-predicts-service-202153543.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">06e3ab42-72a7-4cdf-a928-611209e6f684</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 20:21:53 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636057792</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T20:30:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7a45ef90-3da3-11ec-bffd-ee90648002e0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/7a45ef90-3da3-11ec-bffd-ee90648002e0" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Porsche]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan 'digital twin' for maintenance and service]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Porsche Taycan 'digital twin' for maintenance and service]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Square makes its Cash App available for teen use]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/square/">Square</a> is now <a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp/status/1455942956343611399"><ins>allowing all teenagers</ins></a> to use <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/cash%20app/"><ins>Cash App</ins></a>, after restricting it to adults until now.

They’re both trying to address the problem of skyrocketing drug development costs. A recent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7054832"><ins>2020</ins></a> study found that it costs on average $1.3 billion to create a new pharmaceutical. A lot of that has to do with the process itself. As things stand today, researchers physically synthesize each and every promising compound and then test to see if it’s safe for human use. And as they have tried to develop treatments for more complicated diseases, fewer drugs are passing human trials.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/alphabet-isomorphic-labs-announcement-193546886.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f4af1af-4430-477f-af02-d1fcd04a0a8b</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 19:35:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636054550</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T19:36:04+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Health Care Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6d66baf0-3da5-11ec-bff7-23355b957e42" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/6d66baf0-3da5-11ec-bff7-23355b957e42" width="1600" height="1001" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[DeepMind]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AlphaFold 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AlphaFold 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Riot brings 'League of Legends,' Valorant' and other titles to Epic Games Store]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Riot Games is taking its PC titles into new territory as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/league%20of%20legends/"><em><ins>League of Legends</ins></em></a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/valorant/"><em><ins>Valorant</ins></em></a>, <em>Teamfight Tactics</em> and <em>Legends of Runeterra</em> are all now available on the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/Epic%20Games%20Store/"><ins>Epic Games Store</ins></a>.

The motorcycle will ship with the company’s Cypher III+ operating system, which includes the Cypher Store. And if you plan to get the most out of the 2022 SR, you’ll need to spend money at the marketplace. Post-purchase “DLC” is something we’ve seen the automotive <a href="https://www.engadget.com/bmw-connected-drive-store-subscriptions-193746962.html">industry show increasing interest</a> in recent years.</p><p>At first, the Cypher Store will offer a mix of performance and comfort upgrades. It will later expand to sell purchases that enable features like a park mode, heated grips and faster charging. How much you’ll need to pay for those extras will depend on the model you own.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/089f2c70-3d9a-11ec-ab7d-192cba143aec" alt="Zero Motorcycles 2022 SR" data-uuid="c6f588ff-b136-3492-9bfd-899059db4875"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Zero Motorcycles</div></figure><p>In the case of the 2022 SR, it comes standard with a 14.4 kWh battery. You can upgrade its capacity to 15.6 kWh and then 17.3 kWh. In 2022, Zero Motorcycles will start selling an optional tank accessory that further increases the amount of power the motorcycle’s ZF 75-10 electric motor can access. With every possible upgrade, battery capacity increases to 20.9 kWh. At that point, Zero claims you can expect approximately 227 miles of range when driving in a city and about 113 miles at a more consistent 70 miles per hour clip. For charging, the 2022 SR features a standard J1772 connection, which <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-the-netherlands-supercharger-pilot-223842483.html">even Tesla sells now</a>.</p><p>By default, the 2022 SR’s motor outputs 122 lb-ft of torque and 74 horsepower. It can hit a top speed of 104 miles per hour. As you might have guessed, you can pay extra to unlock better performance from the motor. With a $1,795 in-app purchase, power output increases to 113 horsepower, allowing the 2022 SR to go as fast as 124 miles per hour.</p><p>The 2022 SR will start at $17,995 when it debuts at dealerships in the first quarter of 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zero-motorcycles-2022-sr-annoucement-181805528.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f3091fdd-413c-4d31-a2f8-d8796c2bb6d0</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 18:18:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636059719</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T21:02:14+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d7b7a470-3d99-11ec-bf75-3cdb1c0fe554" width="3840" height="2400" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/d7b7a470-3d99-11ec-bf75-3cdb1c0fe554" width="3840" height="2400" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zero Motorcycles]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zero Motorcycles 2022 SR]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zero Motorcycles 2022 SR]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Muoverti says its tilting stationary bike feels like real cycling]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While nothing can truly match the real thing, a number of stationary <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/exercise%20bike/"><ins>bike</ins></a> companies have tried to replicate the outdoor riding experience.

The electromagnetic resistance is controlled by an algorithm that updates a thousand times per second. This, according to the company, enables simulations of factors including drafting, angular wind speed and rolling resistance in real time.</p><p>TiltBikes are compatible with training apps including <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/zwift/"><ins>Zwift</ins></a>, RGT and Trainer Road. What&#39;s more, there are built-in gaming controls, so you can connect the bike to an Xbox and perhaps squeeze in some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/riders%20republic/"><em>Riders Republic</em></a> as you&#39;re getting a workout. The bike can pair with a smartphone, tablet or PC via Bluetooth too.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/60fab100-3cd7-11ec-bbb7-194a76b57842" style="height:3685;width:5527;" alt="The thumbstick control on a Muoverti TiltBike." data-uuid="4b33eb66-dc15-3d2e-918a-728884104f86"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Muoverti</div></figure><p>The frame is swappable, you can switch it out if you have different handlebar or pedal preferences to someone you share a TiltBike with, or go from a time trial setup to a mountain bike one. You&#39;ll also be able to monitor your workouts through a companion app that tracks more than 20 stats in real time.</p><p>These aren&#39;t exactly the first tilting stationary bikes on the market. <a href="https://www.bowflex.com/bikes/velocore/100914.html"><ins>Bowflex&#39;s Velocore</ins></a>, for instance, can stay locked in place or switch to leaning mode. Alternatively, you can put a bike on rocker plates for that side-to-side motion.</p><p>It appears Muoverti&#39;s goal is to bring together elements from other bikes and to elevate the experience. As it stands, some features that serious cyclists will be looking for don&#39;t seem to be available, such as vertical climb simulation, so it might be a better fit for more casual riders. Still, with its stylish frames, TiltBikes look a bit more like actual bikes than rival models.</p><p>Muoverti hasn&#39;t announced pricing for TiltBikes as yet, though given that some configurations don&#39;t include a display, they could prove less expensive than some other models. The company plans to ship the stationary bikes in 2022, giving you some time to find a decent wind machine to get the full outdoor riding effect.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64061c40-3cd7-11ec-8c7c-def61bcc25be" style="height:4000;width:6000;" alt="A rider on a Muoverti TiltBike using a virtual training experience that&#39;s displayed on a TV." data-uuid="ff99b530-215e-3de0-a853-5f0abf655333"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Muoverti</div></figure><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/muoverti-tiltbike-stationary-bike-180005766.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b432a1db-cee5-4a00-a050-455870135187</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 18:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1635966407</ingested><modified>2021-11-03T19:07:02+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Sports & Recreation]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cycling]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5dac9770-3cd7-11ec-bcc9-24b2a7bf0cdf" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/5dac9770-3cd7-11ec-bcc9-24b2a7bf0cdf" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Muoverti]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Muoverti TiltBike.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Muoverti TiltBike]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['League of Legends' champion Jinx arrives in 'Fortnite']]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Game marketing is creating more <a href="https://www.engadget.com/pubg-mobile-tesla-update-145129031.html">strange bedfellows</a>.

The social network is testing new tools that allow group admins to make money, with new shopping, fundraising and subscription features.</p><p>The company announced the updates at its annual Communities Summit event, where it said the new features will help people who run groups “sustain” the communities they have built. With the changes, Facebook is group admins three ways to monetize their communities. The first two, community shops and fundraisers, mirror features elsewhere on the platform. Community shops is an extension of Facebook’s existing features, and allows group admins to sell themed merch or other goods. Likewise, fundraisers will enable admins to crowdfund specific projects or otherwise “offset the costs of running the group.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>But the third feature is entirely new: paid subgroups. Subgroups are essentially smaller groups-within-a-group where members pay a monthly fee to participate. While Facebook is also allowing group admins to set up free subgroups, the paid version of the feature is the company’s latest effort to create subscription-based products. Elsewhere, Facebook has been<a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-has-a-new-plan-to-help-creators-avoid-app-store-fees-174337629.html"><ins> hyping subscriptions</ins></a> as a way for creators to make money, either via newsletters or fan subscriptions for streamers. In the context of groups, subscriptions are meant to enable access to exclusive or specialized content like “coaching or networking or deeper conversations.”</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/77782fc0-3d86-11ec-bd8c-7c68e7307139" style="height:1080;width:1920;" alt="facebook is enabling group admins to make money." data-uuid="c59e51dc-be8a-3690-9822-655bbea455f5"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Facebook</div></figure><p>Maria Smith, Facebook’s VP of Communities says that Facebook doesn’t expect all groups will want or need paid features, but that many groups already sell their own merch or organize fundraisers. So bringing the tools directly to them could be useful. On the other hand, groups have also been home to Facebook’s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-removes-stop-the-steal-facebook-group-210215893.html"><ins>most toxic</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-resisted-efforts-to-be-less-divisive-report-203314601.html"><ins>divisive</ins></a> content, and the company has at times struggled to keep problematic groups in check.</p><p>Given Facebook’s track record here, it feels almost inevitable that some groups will find a way to misuse these tools (Facebook is planning a slow rollout, so most groups won’t have access to these features right away.) Smith notes that subgroups will have the same moderation tools as the wider group and that it could in some cases make it easier for admin to handle. “It’s going to classify the discussions in the different subgroups and then they can manage them more efficiently,” she said. She added that groups and subgroups will also be required to follow the company’s commerce guidelines and fundraising rules.</p><p>As much as groups have been maligned, the feature is also the one that Facebook frequently points to as proof that its platform can bring people together and be a force for good. Facebook has also indicated that groups will play an important role in its plan to build a metaverse. “We&#39;re focused on building bridges from our apps on 2D screens into more immersive virtual experiences,” Mark Zuckerberg said at the start of Thursday’s event. “Facebook, and your groups, are going to be central to this.”</p><p>Zuckerberg is still explaining what a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-metaverse-meta-explained-or-not-120032885.html"><ins>Metaverse means</ins></a> for the social network and the company now known <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-new-name-meta-182151399.html"><ins>as Meta</ins></a>. But it’s not hard to imagine that today’s Facebook groups could one day inhabit virtual spaces within the metaverse, though that vision is still “a ways off,” says Smith.</p><p>In addition to the new monetization features, Facebook announced several other updates for groups, including:</p><ul><li><p>New customization features that allow admins to change background colors, font styles and other aspects of the way groups look</p></li><li><p>Community chats to make it easier for admins and group moderators to reach each other</p></li><li><p>A new “featured” section so group admins can pin content that stays at the top of the group</p></li><li><p>Facebook also plans to start testing a new set of features that will streamline the groups and Pages experience for admins who manage both a group and a corresponding page. It’s still not totally clear exactly how this will work, but Facebook says the goal is to bring some group-specific features, like moderation tools, into Pages while also giving admins the ability to “use an official voice when interacting with their community.”</p></li></ul>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-is-adding-monetization-features-to-groups-160031356.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6f37fdf-4441-494e-a229-4298114e6630</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 16:00:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636041102</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T15:51:51+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4943b9d0-3d86-11ec-a78b-41e36097b7d4" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/4943b9d0-3d86-11ec-a78b-41e36097b7d4" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Facebook]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook is launching paid subgroups so admins can bring in subscription dollars.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Facebook paid subgroups]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Blue Origin loses lawsuit over NASA's SpaceX lunar lander contract (updated)]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Blue Origin has failed in its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-federal-claims-court-nasa-challenge-163927526.html">lawsuit against NASA</a> over <a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">SpaceX&#39;s lunar lander contract</a>. <em>CNBC</em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/spacex-nasa-artemis-lunar-lander-contract-report-184448656.html">reports</a> the Federal Court of Claims has ruled against Blue Origin, dismissing the company&#39;s claims.

The firm even tried <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jeff-bezos-nasa-open-letter-181522642.html">drastically undercutting SpaceX</a> with a $2 billion bid, arguing at the time that NASA has historically awarded contracts to multiple partners to make sure a mission launches on time.</p><p>The outcome isn&#39;t surprising given NASA&#39;s own skepticism. The agency <a href="https://www.engadget.com/elon-musk-on-blue-origin-lawsuit-151130133.html">believed Blue Origin was gambling</a> with its initial $5.9 billion proposal on flawed assumptions that NASA would both haggle down the price and receive the funding needed to cover a more expensive bid. Blue Origin disagreed with the assessment and felt it made a good offer, but that still suggests NASA preferred SpaceX for its lower pricing instead of any unfair criteria.</p><p>In a statement, Blue Origin portrayed the ruling as a partial victory. The case allegedly &quot;highlighted the important safety issues&quot; in HLS procurement. and showed the need for an &quot;unprejudiced&quot; process that spurred competition and included backup systems. The company was also keen to tout its continued involvement with the Artemis program, including development of lunar resource systems, robotics and sensors. It&#39;s not clear if Blue Origin will challenge the outcome (we&#39;ve asked about this), but we wouldn&#39;t be shocked if there was an appeal. You can read the full statement below.</p><blockquote><p>Our lawsuit with the Court of Federal Claims highlighted the important safety issues with the Human Landing System procurement process that must still be addressed. Returning astronauts safely to the Moon through NASA’s public-private partnership model requires an unprejudiced procurement process alongside sound policy that incorporates redundant systems and promotes competition. Blue Origin remains deeply committed to the success of the Artemis program, and we have a broad base of activity on multiple contracts with NASA to achieve the United States’ goal to return to the Moon to stay. We are fully engaged with NASA to mature sustainable lander designs, conduct a wide variety of technology risk reductions, and provide Commercial Lunar Payload Services. We are also under contract with NASA to develop in-situ resource utilization technology, lunar space robotics, and lunar landing sensor collaboration including testing on New Shepard. We look forward to hearing from NASA on next steps in the HLS procurement process.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Update 11/4 1:50PM ET:</strong><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-statement-on-artemis-lunar-lander-court-decision">NASA said</a> it would resume work with SpaceX &quot;as soon as possible&quot; following the decision. It added that it was working with multiple companies on Artemis projects, such as a 2022 request for recurring lunar landing services.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/blue-origin-loses-nasa-lawsuit-over-spacex-151101253.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3ab851c0-7d9d-4bc0-96f1-b52f76c754ad</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 15:11:01 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636057840</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T20:30:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Science]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1e7ac1a0-ee83-11eb-8ff5-422b92b790a3" width="5500" height="4185" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/1e7ac1a0-ee83-11eb-8ff5-422b92b790a3" width="5500" height="4185" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Joe Skipper / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Billionaire American businessman Jeff Bezos speaks with his brother Mark at a post-launch press conference after they flew on Blue Origin's inaugural flight to the edge of space, in the nearby town of Van Horn, Texas, U.S., July 20, 2021.

Check out with a supporting app and you&#39;ll have the choice of billing methods for the transaction. However, this won&#39;t let developers duck Google&#39;s fees.</p><p>The company stressed that it would still charge service fees, but would cut that cost by four percent to help offset costs from running a separate billing system. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-fees-subscriptions-e-books-music-streaming-apps-170908763.html">E-book and music streaming app developers</a> would pay Google a six percent cut instead of the previous 10 percent, for instance, while <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-fee-reduction-july-1-172359771.html">most creators</a> will pay 11 percent instead of 15 percent. Some very popular developers won&#39;t see much change at all, though, dropping from 30 percent to 26 percent. More implementation details are coming in the &quot;weeks and months&quot; ahead.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Senior public policy director Wilson White argued that Google still needed to take a cut to &quot;continue to invest&quot; in Android and the Play Store.  The fees help keep those platforms free, White said. They also fund the advancement of Android, developer tools and security.</p><p>Whether or not Korean regulators will accept Google&#39;s approach isn&#39;t clear. The new law doesn&#39;t bar Google from taking a slice of in-app purchases, but the small drop in fees might not be enough to offset the  costs of third-party systems. The law was meant to open up app stores and foster competition — that won&#39;t happen if it&#39;s too cost-prohibitive to use third-party payments. While this might stop Google from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-countersues-epic-for-sidestepping-fees-on-in-game-purchases-084602622.html">suing developers</a> who offer alternatives, it may still discourage those developers from considering alternatives in the first place.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-play-store-alternate-payment-south-korea-134255092.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">49cc4a50-b6f0-4580-b8e2-56eaf767327d</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 13:42:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636032844</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T13:34:19+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/46629cc0-dcf8-11eb-963b-286771b88ce3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/46629cc0-dcf8-11eb-963b-286771b88ce3" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Mika Baumeister on Unsplash]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Google Play Store on an Android phone]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Play Store on an Android phone]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Small, affordable gadgets that make great stocking stuffers]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s easy to think that the best gadget gifts are the fanciest and most expensive things.

Like other Chromecasts, this one lets you stream movies and TV shows from major services like Netflix, YouTube, Hulu andHBO Max, among many others.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Google TV interface has always been pretty easy to navigate, but it’s simpler than ever thanks to the remote that now comes included with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chromecast-with-google-tv-review-163024220.html">Chromecast</a>. It has an Assistant button, giving you quick access to voice commands, plus a circular D-pad, shortcut buttons for YouTube and Netflix, and support for HDMI-CEC and IR, allowing you to control your entire TV with it. And, unlike larger set-top boxes or smart TVs that your recipient may already have, the Chromecast is portable, so they can take it with them to make binge-watching their favorite shows easier when they’re not at home.</p><a class="athena-button" href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/b3N7L6" id="194c64591ba646139296dbb6bdf4f9ac" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Best Buy;elmt:impactRadius;pdid:">Buy Chromecast with Google TV at Best Buy - $50</a><h2>Apple AirTags</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cf247560-3d6f-11ec-b2fe-103be51e8500" alt="Apple AirTags for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.

(You could even get an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-apple-airtag-cases-holders-accessories-123036404.html">AirTag case</a> for them, too, and still spend less than $50.) These quarter-sized Bluetooth trackers pair almost immediately with iOS devices and can then be tracked using the Find My app.</p><p>You can use them to keep track of nearly anything, but they work best on items that take clips or keyrings or things like backpacks that have small pockets. In addition to showing their location, the Find My app also lets you force the AirTag to play a loud chime so you can more easily find it in your home. And if you’re close enough to the missing item, Apple’s Precision Finding feature can literally guide you to it using the tech in your iPhone’s U1 chip.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3uFZ1sA" id="79f4edb56337445d9ac6c503012f1d38" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Apple AirTag at Amazon - $29</a><h2>KeySmart Classic key holder</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cf2315d0-3d6f-11ec-bdcf-58eee5cec100" alt="KeySmart key holder for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.

It’s easy to stack all of your keys on either end of the KeySmart and, once installed, you can rotate out only the key you need to unlock your door.

We all have so many devices — phones, tablets, smartwatches, headphones, earbuds, and more — and most of them need regular charging. An extra charger like Anker’s lets you power up more devices at once, but it also does so more efficiently. The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-gan-nano-ii-chargers-smaller-more-efficient-160045592.html">gallium nitride technology</a> inside this small cube prevents it from overheating even when charging up a larger device like a MacBook Pro. It’s also 58 percent smaller than the MBP’s own charging adapter, so it’ll take up less space in a bag or backpack when you’re on the go.</p><p>Most bricks of this size aren’t able to support fast-charging for multiple devices, but the 65W capacity of this Nano II model makes it a good option for all of your devices. Just before publishing this story, the 65W model went up in price by a few dollars, pushing it over our $50 threshold — but Anker sells <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:45W" href="https://amzn.to/3qlev5x">45W</a> and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:30W" href="https://amzn.to/302nJsi">30W</a> models as well, so you can get the same charging technology for even less.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3a4nQ8b" id="ba428ed51811452ca45d111d7fbf4e38" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Anker Nano II (65W) at Amazon - $55</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3qlev5x" id="5cdfd32c079849d7be6c1c5014d597f6" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Anker Nano II (45W) at Amazon - $40</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/302nJsi" id="ec1bcf7ac8f64cdbb7e17045e6357d31" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Anker Nano II (30W) at Amazon - $34</a><h2>Anker USB-C to Lightning cable</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/cf22c7b0-3d6f-11ec-8bcf-c3d551159f4a" alt="Anker USB-C to Lightning cable for the Engadget 2021 Holiday Gift Guide.

Its clamp grip can hold all smartphones and its rubber feet prevent it from slipping. But the flexible legs are the kicker here — they let you wrap the stand around objects like railings so you can get the best angle possible when shooting photos or videos.

Currently, both Amazon and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:B&amp;H Photo" href="https://fave.co/3bG5dbv">B&amp;H Photo</a> have a great deal on the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:512GB WiFi model" href="https://amzn.to/3o0Y5MR">512GB WiFi model</a> — it&#39;s down to $1,249, which is $150 off and a new all-time-low price. If you plan on using this iPad as a laptop replacement, you won&#39;t regret springing for a model like this with a bit of extra storage.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3o0Y5MR" id="a271e252f7fa409996c6ba229aef3ed2" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy 12.9-inch iPad Pro (512GB) at Amazon - $1,249</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3bG5dbv" id="77ae00d4dc3848af9240f549495b7679" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:B&amp;H Photo;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy 12.9-inch iPad Pro (512GB) at B&amp;H - $1,249</a><p>We gave the 12.9-inch iPad Pro a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-pro-2021-m1-review-liquid-retina-xdr-5g-features-price-130049005.html">score of 87</a> thanks in part to its stellar performance. The latest tablets run on Apple&#39;s M1 chipset, so they perform similarly to the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-140031323.html">MacBook Air M1</a>. They handle taxing tasks like 4K video editing smoothly, and they won&#39;t break a sweat when handling multiple browser tabs, mobile games and other actions. Battery life is good too — you should get at least 10 hours before needing to recharge. On top of that, the latest iPad Pros have support for 5G, and they include a USB-C port for charging and connecting peripherals, plus the new Center Stage camera that keeps you in frame on video calls.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Both the 11-inch and the 12.9-inch iPad Pros look much the same as they have for the past couple of years. However, the 12.9-inch version has the added bonus of a Liquid Retina XDR display. You&#39;ll notice its full benefits when watching videos — the full screen can hit up to 1,000 nits of brightness, while some HDR elements like flashy visual effects will shoot up to 1,600 nits. Combine that with the screen&#39;s 120Hz refresh rate and you have a stunning panel that&#39;s excellent to use on a daily basis, and even better when watching TV shows and movies.</p><p>We still consider the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:MacBook Air M1" href="https://amzn.to/3bEjCVF">MacBook Air M1</a> to be the best Apple laptop for most people, but you can get a similar laptop experience with a bit more versatility by opting for an iPad Pro. Paired with the right accessories — like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Magic Keyboard" href="https://amzn.to/2ZXM8iP">Magic Keyboard</a> and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Apple Pencil" href="https://amzn.to/3GMoF4V">Apple Pencil</a> —  a 512GB iPad Pro would make a solid laptop replacement for those that value portability above all else. And thanks to the M1 chipset, you won&#39;t sacrifice power to get a better grab-and-go machine.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apple-129-inch-ipad-pro-with-512gb-of-storage-is-150-off-right-now-130003063.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">14af99c6-3cd7-4d5f-8df0-caf22f754844</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 13:00:03 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636030337</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T12:52:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/6c1a9ec0-b815-11eb-8b33-87fbb637229f" width="3000" height="1542" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/6c1a9ec0-b815-11eb-8b33-87fbb637229f" width="3000" height="1542" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chris Velazco/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple iPad Pro (2021) review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple iPad Pro (2021) review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch 15 minutes of 'Elden Ring' gameplay here at 9:45AM ET]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Can&#39;t wait to play <em>Elden Ring</em>?

It’s not the <a href="https://reolink.com/product/reolink-go/">only option in the marketplace</a>, but it’s easily the best known. And at $430, it’s also the most expensive. Enter the Go 2. Not only is it more affordable than its predecessor, but it also comes with a handful of upgrades.</p><p>First, the price. Arlo plans to sell the Go 2 for $250. As for upgrades, the most notable is a 1080p camera, up from a 720p one on the first model, that features a lens with a 130-degree field of view. It also comes with a built-in spotlight, support for two-way audio and color night vision. As with its predecessor, an internal battery allows you to install the camera without the need for any wires and the weather-proof casing will protect it from the external elements.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c6410e70-3ccc-11ec-b6f7-0624c8cc71b4" alt="Arlo Go 2" data-uuid="f6f8b95a-4e4f-35d1-9d1c-7fbe8750af7d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Arlo</div></figure><p>The Go 2 includes both WiFi and LTE connectivity, and it can use the latter as a backup if your home wireless network suffers an outage. Otherwise, it’s fully capable of running on only an LTE connection. On that note, while each Go 2 camera will come with three months of complimentary access to <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Arlo Secure" href="https://fave.co/3CQaola">Arlo Secure</a>, you need the company’s subscription to use the device. If you prefer to store footage locally, the Go 2 comes with a microSD slot. Additionally, if you ever lose the camera or someone decides to steal it, it’s possible to locate it through GPS.</p><p>Arlo envisions people using the Go 2 at construction sites and vacation homes. In other words, places where a stable WiFi connection may not be guaranteed. You can buy the Arlo Go 2 starting today through Verizon. It will come to additional carriers in 2022.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/arlo-go-2-lte-wifi-annoucement-120033836.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3d2901ec-80df-4048-ac64-c75d1fa40011</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 12:00:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636032270</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T13:24:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b80960a0-3ccc-11ec-96f7-e3152e91c453" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/b80960a0-3ccc-11ec-96f7-e3152e91c453" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Arlo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Arlo Go 2]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Arlo Go 2]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: Ford electrified a classic truck to show off its EV motor kit]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Both small bespoke auto customization businesses and major car manufacturers, like Chevy, are pulling out the old and putting in the new when it comes to vintage car engines. Now Ford is making a similar statement with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ford-electric-f100-eluminator-concept-truck-140543585.html https://www.engadget.com/...">F-100 Eluminator concept</a>.</p><p>It’s an upgraded 1978 pickup truck with two of the company&#39;s new Eluminator electric crate motor kits. The power plants are the same as the Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition, giving the F-100 a total 480HP and 634lb/ft of torque. Ford didn&#39;t discuss performance benchmarks or range — it’s likely the car body is heavier due to the era it comes from. And yes, it’s a concept.</p><p>Ford is hoping, however, that you’d buy the $3,900 Eluminator motor for your project car. The automaker eventually hopes to supply everything you might need for an EV retrofit, including batteries. For now, however, just the engine is available, making it a high-level project that is probably beyond the abilities of most of us.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-alarm-pro-now-available-183939069.html">Amazon&#39;s Ring Alarm Pro is now available</a></h2><h3>The system starts at $250.</h3><h3></h3><p></p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/ring-alarm-pro-now-available-183939069.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/c0520c00-3d60-11ec-b4f6-ae9c6d0e5f87" style="height:422;width:675;" alt="The Morning After" data-uuid="0a353f42-9b65-39b6-a1ca-20380147e10e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Amazon</div></figure></a><p>It combines an Eero WiFi 6 with a home security system.

Another option is to buy it as part of a $300 eight-piece kit that comes with a keypad and multiple sensors.</p><p>Keep in mind, you’ll need a Ring Protect subscription to take advantage of many of its features. That adds cloud video storage and 24/7 backup internet for your security devices (via an LTE module in the Ring Pro base station).

If you’re waiting on that paid DLC, <em>Happy Home Paradise</em> is still scheduled to come out tomorrow.</p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-version-2-080043672.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><strong>Continue reading.</strong></a></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p></p><h3>The biggest news stories you might have missed</h3><h3></h3><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/zip-charge-go-electric-vehicles-122503445.html"><ins>ZipCharge Go is a suitcase-size power bank for EVs</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/adidas-xbox-360-forum-mid-155422425.html"><ins>Adidas made Xbox 360 sneakers you can actually buy</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/report-apple-sold-a-record-number-of-mac-books-last-quarter-091233817.html"><ins>Apple sold a record number of MacBooks last quarter</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-vivobook-13-slate-oled-detachable-2-in-1-160058712.html"><ins>ASUS&#39; Vivobook Slate is a 2-in-1 laptop with an OLED display for $600</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-140027031.html"><ins>Amazon&#39;s Alexa-powered indoor air-quality monitor alerts you to pollution</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/metroid-dread-is-a-nintendo-essential-151014629.html"><ins>&#39;Metroid Dread&#39; reminded me why Metroid is an essential series</ins></a></p><p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/holiday-gifts-best-wearables-130050343.html"><ins>The best smartwatches, fitness trackers and wearables to gift</ins></a></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-morning-after-ford-electrified-a-classic-truck-to-show-off-its-ev-motor-kit-113525635.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5f5b0f45-19e3-4bcd-8177-d40e9fbd60c5</guid><dc:creator>Mat Smith</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 11:35:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636025494</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T11:31:38+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mat Smith]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9843ea10-3ca9-11ec-be6b-b4e26a7ddb4c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/9843ea10-3ca9-11ec-be6b-b4e26a7ddb4c" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ford]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ford F-100 Eluminator electric concept truck]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Ford F-100 Eluminator electric concept truck]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM's Cruise starts testing fully driverless taxi rides in San Francisco]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GM&#39;s self-driving <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-12-gm-doubling-staff-at-cruise-autonomous-vehicles.html">Cruise division</a> has launched its fully driverless robo-taxi service in San Francisco, with co-founder and President Kyle Vogt getting the <a href="https://twitter.com/kvogt/status/1455992707952693250">first ride</a>, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/cruise-launches-driverless-robotaxi-service-for-employees-in-san-francisco/"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> reported. To start with, the service will be offered only to GM employees, as it&#39;s still only licensed for testing.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Earlier this week, I requested a ride through our Cruise app and took several back-to-back rides in San Francisco — with no one else in the vehicle,&quot; Vogt wrote in a <a href="https://youtu.be/dmvZBiWYkFQ">YouTube video description</a>. &quot;There are lots of other Cruise employees (not just me) who are testing and refining the full customer experience as we take another major step toward the first commercial AV [ride hailing] product in a dense urban environment.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="7ca78dbbfa1b45978473c453b709b782"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dmvZBiWYkFQ?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Vogt said the Cruise launched the Bolt vehicles on Monday at 11PM, and it &quot;began to roam around the city, waiting for a ride request.&quot; He got his first ride from a Cruise Bolt EV called &quot;Sourdough,&quot; saying the experience was &quot;smooth.&quot; A <a href="https://youtu.be/svebS-uR7wc">separate video</a> showed sections before and after the vehicle picked up passengers while it was in &quot;ghost mode&quot; with no one in it.</p><p>Early last month, Cruise <a href="https://www.engadget.com/waymo-cruise-approval-driverless-rides-california-070950457.html">received</a> a California DMV permit to operate the service between the hours of 10PM and 6AM at a maximum speed of 30 MPH in mild weather conditions (no worse than light rain and fog). It&#39;s allowed to run them without drivers and charge for delivery services, but not ride-hailing. For paid robo-taxi rides, it must apply for a final permit with the California Public Utilities Commission.&nbsp;</p><p>GM recently launched its &quot;Ultra Cruise&quot; system for passenger vehicles, promising that it will &quot;ultimately enable hands-free driving in 95 percent of all driving scenarios.&quot; The company has spent 10 million miles testing the system, and its previous Super Cruise has generally garnered <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2021-cadillac-escalade-super-cruise-quick-drive-review/">positive</a> reviews <a href="https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/cadillac-super-cruise-is-as-good-or-better-than-tesla-autopilot/">compared to</a> rival systems like Tesla&#39;s Autopilot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update 11/4/2021 1:19 PM ET</strong>: Cruise told Engadget that it is currently only offering fully driverless rides to employees right now. While it is allowed under its testing permit to offer free rides to the public as well, it&#39;s not doing so yet. The headline has been changed to emphasize that the program is still in the testing phase, and a reference to rides being available to certain members of the public has been removed.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/g-ms-cruise-is-now-offering-driverless-taxi-rides-in-san-francisco-103542426.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">f938c21a-d77e-4a9c-b993-b632273f5216</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 10:35:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636046907</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T17:28:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Travel & Tourism]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3f32a8e0-3d52-11ec-b7dd-743871b058c9" width="1122" height="676" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/3f32a8e0-3d52-11ec-b7dd-743871b058c9" width="1122" height="676" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cruise]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GM's Cruise is now offering driverless taxi rides in San Francisco]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[GM's Cruise is now offering driverless taxi rides in San Francisco]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Crypto scammers stole $500K from wallets using targeted Google Ads]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Scammers used a new type of phishing campaign, which doesn&#39;t use emails, to steal around $500,000 worth of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/squid-game-cryptocurrency-scam-073957132.html">cryptocurrency</a> from wallets this past weekend alone. According to <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/">Check Point Research</a>, those bad actors purchased Google Ads placements for their fraudulent websites that imitate popular wallets, such as Phantom App and MetaMask. The malicious websites have URLs close to the original&#39;s, such as &quot;phantonn.app&quot; — the real service&#39;s URL is &quot;phantom.app&quot; — with designs also copied from the real deal.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/2ff746b0-3d52-11ec-ab77-c4a8cf26a68e" alt="Check Point Research" data-uuid="3e0272e4-9c50-3400-8018-d9d94e5b8a63"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Check Point Research</div></figure><p>The scammers will then steal the victim&#39;s passphrase if they visit the fake website and type it in. If the victim uses the fake website to create a new wallet, they will be given the attacker&#39;s secret recovery phrase. In the event that they use the recovery phrase to log in, they&#39;ll actually be logging into the bad actor&#39;s account, and any fund transferred to it will go to the scammer. For MetaMask, in particular, the fake website  has the option to import an existing wallet. Since doing so requires a seed phrase, the scammers will  also get access to it.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>As Check Point Research explains, the Phantom App and MetaMask are some of the most popular wallets for Solana and Ethereum. It cross-referenced Reddit forums to come to the conclusion that around half a million dollars were stolen last weekend alone, and it found 11 compromised wallet accounts containing crypto worth between $1,000 and $10,000. The scammers had already withdrawn funds from those wallets before CPR found them.&nbsp;</p><p>CPR says scamming groups are now bidding on keywords on Google Ads, which is a testament to how effective the method is. It&#39;s now advising users to examine the wallet&#39;s URL closely and to skip Google Ads results altogether so as not to unknowingly fall for the scam.</p><div id="90e807589a25456ea04a57657e22d424"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RRlgjBSQCw0?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/crypto-scammers-google-ads-phishing-campaign-100044007.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">789bde4d-583e-40f0-986a-9770f1b1cdcf</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 04 Nov 2021 10:00:44 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1636020210</ingested><modified>2021-11-04T10:03:33+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a6fe890-ac41-11eb-b1a7-507baac40e9c" width="4252" height="2838" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-05/0a6fe890-ac41-11eb-b1a7-507baac40e9c" width="4252" height="2838" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[dulezidar via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Ljubljana, Slovenia - may 14 Bitcoin and alt coins cryptocurrency close up shoot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Bitcoin and alt coins cryptocurrency]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
