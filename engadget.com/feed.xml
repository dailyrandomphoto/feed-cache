When we last left the young crew of the <em>USS Protostar</em>, they had just left the Murder Planet and successfully fled the Diviner’s ship thanks to the activation of the ship’s secret experimental engine. Episode six, Kobayashi, picks up this thread, pushing the story… and possibly the timeline forward in some significant ways this week.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The title is a dead giveaway to one of the threads running through the episode, at least: “Kobayashi” is the name of the ship from the infamous “Kobayashi Maru” test (“Maru” means ship in Japanese). It’s basically a no-win scenario that cadets at Starfleet Academy are run through to test their readiness for command, except this time it’s self-proclaimed captain Dal in the big chair via a holodeck simulation.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/b25a2be0-6e6c-11ec-81ff-cea94c5ca9ba" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Brett Gray as Dal in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ &#xc2;&#xa9;2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

Aside from the absolute hilarity as Dal’s frustration mounts, it’s a pretty standard character study, designed to flesh out Dal and craft him more into the leader he wants to be.</p><p>There’s also some fan service here thanks to cameos from some favorite characters brought to life thanks to the wonders of CGI and well-chosen sound clips. As with Janeway, the show being animated keeps the older characters from having that creepy <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-12-20-star-wars-rogue-one-cgi-actor.html"><em>Rogue One Princess Leia look</em></a>, but the audio samples could have used a lot more processing to have them match up. And why a show designed for newcomers needed this much fan service, I don’t know, but at least it’s not <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-18-star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-review.html"><em>Rise of Skywalker</em></a> bad.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c6fbb230-6e6c-11ec-bfee-019e5d750738" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Ella Purnell as Gwyn and Angus Imrie as Zero in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ &#xc2;&#xa9;2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

Janeway has the files, except they’re classified and it’s up to Gwyn and Zero to try to open them up. And, though the initial reveal from them is a bit of a shocker (to be delved into next week), it’s the flashback sequence early in the episode that yielded the juiciest info for now.</p><p>We’re shown the Diviner 17 years earlier, in horrible health and already looking for the <em>USS Protostar</em>. He decides to create a “progeny,” in the hopes of continuing his race, even though it is against the rules. (Whose rules? That’s another unanswered question.) But the interesting reveal here is that the Diviner was already looking for the Protostar 17 years ago, suggesting that this series may not occupy the 2383 time frame we were given in press materials (though never mentioned on-screen).</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fe886e00-6e6c-11ec-baa3-fe2810ba79e3" alt="STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Jason Mantzoukas as Jankom Pog, Rylee Alazraqui as Rok-Tahk, Brett Gray as Dal, Ella Purnell as Gwyn Kate Mulgrew as Janeway, and Angus Imrie as Zero in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ &#xc2;&#xa9;2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

Even assuming the <em>Protostar</em> is built and launched in a year (which I doubt), <em>Prodigy</em> can’t take place any earlier than 2396, placing it firmly around the time of <em>Picard</em>, which is set in 2399. It’s possible that <em>Prodigy</em> is actually a few years later, however, making it the first Star Trek series set in the 25th century. Or the <em>Protostar</em> traveled through time, complicating things even further.</p><p>But assuming the time period is, in fact, the 25th century, this isn’t the first time we’ve seen the future of the Federation or Starfleet: <em>Discovery</em> is now set in the 32nd century, after all. But being much closer to the time period of earlier shows like <em>The Next Generation</em>, <em>Deep Space Nine</em> and, of course, <em>Voyager</em> makes <em>Prodigy</em> more of a direct continuation of that era. The inclusion of Janeway as a training hologram already gave us a peek as the vaunted status the <em>Voyager </em>crew holds after their Delta Quadrant sojourn, but now the advanced tech seen in episode three “Starstruck” suddenly makes a lot more sense knowing it might be a few years… or decades since <em>Voyager</em>.</p><div id="aa466e8ad1ff497aa1446c179ed31d28"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8316X_cGYs?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>With the exception of <em>Picard</em>, the live-action shows have largely stayed away from the immediate future of the <em>TNG-DS9-Voyager</em> era, choosing instead to retread the 23rd century or even jump forward nearly a thousand years. It’s certainly odd given the popularity of those shows, but in leaving it be Paramount+ has left a lot of room for <em>Prodigy</em> and <em>Lower Decks</em> to do something interesting there, experimenting with new genres while still appeasing hard-core fans. This may be the future we’ve been waiting to see on Star Trek.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-prodigy-episode-six-140026030.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">cc8d4063-e3f1-4fe2-9ef4-513873d1d6d0</guid><dc:creator>Kris Naudus</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 14:00:26 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641419343</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T21:49:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Naudus]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9c21b1e0-6e6c-11ec-b37d-9ec80d433867" width="3000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9c21b1e0-6e6c-11ec-b37d-9ec80d433867" width="3000" height="1264" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Nickelodeon]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[STAR TREK: PRODIGY: Ep#106 --  Kate Mulgrew as Janeway, Jason Mantzoukas as Jankom Pog, Angus Imrie as Zero, Ella Purnell as Gwyn and Rylee Alazraqui as Rok-Tahk in STAR TREK: PRODIGY streaming on Paramount+  Photo: Nickelodeon/Paramount+ Â©2021 VIACOM INTERNATIONAL.

We gave the tablet a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-ipad-air-2020-review-130044886.html">score of 90</a> when it first came out thanks in part to its speedy performance, healthy battery life and fun colors. Normally $599, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:iPad Air" href="https://amzn.to/3EU8zny">iPad Air</a> is back on sale at Amazon right now for $539, or $60 off its normal price. Only the silver model has been discounted at the time of writing this, but if you don&#39;t mind skipping out on one of the more unique color options, this sale price is one of the best we&#39;ve seen in months.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3EU8zny" id="a4e26322f5fe4f06999781254c0eea77" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy iPad Air at Amazon - $539</a><p>The Air sits in between the 10.2-inch iPad and the iPad Pros as Apple&#39;s mid-tier option. It runs on an A14 Bionic chipset with a six-core CPU and a four-core GPU, and this particular model on sale has 64GB of storage and WiFi 6 capabilities. Apple refreshed the tablet&#39;s design to make it look more like the Pros, complete with flat edges, a USB-C port for charging and a lovely 10.9-inch Liquid Retina Display. You won&#39;t get FaceID on this machine, but you will get TouchID thanks to the fingerprint reader on the device&#39;s power button.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Overall, we found the Air to be zippy both in performance and WiFi speeds, and its battery lasted up to 12.5 hours in our testing. While the latest iPad Pros are better if you&#39;re looking for a laptop replacement, you could use the Air as a 2-in-1 while on the go thanks to its compatibility with Apple&#39;s Magic Keyboard. It also supports the second-generation Apple Pencil, allowing it to be a digital notebook for those that prefer writing things out by hand.</p><p>A discount like this is a good one to consider if you want an all-purpose tablet that&#39;s one step up from the base iPad.

Its original developers <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-03-15-torrent-front-end-popcorn-time-made-streaming-movies-free-and-ea.html">took the service down</a> and abandoned the project merely a few days after it launched in 2014. But since the project was open source, other developers were able pick up where they left off, and it&#39;s been killed and revived a few more times ever since. It remains to be seen whether Popcorn Time is now gone for good, but it looks like the biggest contributor to its most recent demise is the dwindling interest in the app.</p><p>On its website, the developers posted a graph of &quot;popcorn time&quot; searches over the past seven years. While   the app enjoyed a ton of searches in the months after its launch in 2015, the graph shows a sharp decline in interest by 2016. Its popularity continued to wane, and it never really recovered after that, at least based on Google Trends.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-04/popcorn-time-alternative-is-hard-to-find-as-app-shuts-down?sref=10lNAhZ9"><em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the group behind Popcorn Time announced its closure in an email. While they didn&#39;t say whether law enforcement action was a factor behind their decision to shut down the app this time around, Popcorn Time has had brushes with the law in the past. The original version may have closed after authorities got involved, and Hollywood studios even <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-09-02-popcorn-time-hollywood-lawsuit.html">sued individual users</a> who allegedly downloaded and shared copies of movies illegally.&nbsp;</p><p>Developers associated with Popcorn Time previously <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015-03-20-popcorn-time-p2p.html">talked about</a> how they&#39;re not responsible for piracy themselves, because the service doesn&#39;t actually host any content. Instead, it relied on a peer-to-peer sharing system and only provided a way for users to access content hosted on other people&#39;s computers.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/movie-piracy-app-popcorn-time-shuts-down-115523694.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d05730b2-9427-4eac-99fd-d6d4cdb2cc4c</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 11:55:23 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641467549</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T11:12:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dd39fd50-6ed4-11ec-aee8-3c5f97a795ad" width="1148" height="651" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/dd39fd50-6ed4-11ec-aee8-3c5f97a795ad" width="1148" height="651" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Popcorn Time]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Popcorn Time]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Popcorn Time]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[French regulator fines Google and Facebook a combined $238 million over cookies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>France&#39;s data regulator CNIL has <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-cnil-fines-google-total-150-million-euros-and-facebook-60-million-euros-non-compliance">fined Google</a> €150 million ($170 million) and Meta/Facebook €60 million ($68 million) for violating EU privacy rules. Both companies failed to allow French users to easily reject cookie tracking technology as required by EU privacy rules, according to CNIL&#39;s news release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The fines were specifically levied against Google&#39;s US and Irish operations (€90 million and €60 million respectively) and against Facebook&#39;s Irish arm. Both companies face daily fines of €100,000 if they don&#39;t change their practices within three months of CNIL&#39;s official decision.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>In addition to the fines, the restricted committee ordered the companies to provide Internet users located in France with a means of refusing cookies as simple as the existing means of accepting them, in order to guarantee their freedom of consent, within three months. If they fail to do so, the companies will have to pay a penalty of 100,000 euros per day of delay.</p></blockquote><p><em>&quot;</em>​​We are reviewing the authority&#39;s decision and remain committed to working with relevant authorities,&quot; a Meta spokesperson told <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/google-facebook-face-big-privacy-fines-in-france/"><em>Politico</em></a>. &quot;Our cookie consent controls provide people with greater control over their data, including a new settings menu on Facebook and Instagram where people can revisit and manage their decisions at any time, and we continue to develop and improve these controls.&quot;</p><p>&quot;People trust us to respect their right to privacy and keep them safe. We understand our responsibility to protect that trust and are committing to further changes and active work with the CNIL in light of this decision under the ePrivacy Directive,&quot; a Google spokesperson said in a statement.</p><p>CNIL said it has issued 100 orders and sanctions related to non-compliance with cookie legislation since it went into force on March 31, 2021. The regulator previously fined Google €100 million for cookie violations under European e-Privacy rules and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-01-21-france-fines-google-over-gdpr.html">€50 million</a> for GDPR violations.&nbsp;</p><p>Google is still fighting the €100 million fine before France&#39;s highest court. It&#39;s expected to fight the latest sanction as well, according <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/google-facebook-face-big-privacy-fines-in-france/"><em>Politico</em></a>. At the same time, the fines against Google and Meta&#39;s Irish operations point to major tension between the EU and Ireland. Europe sees Ireland&#39;s actions as too friendly toward tech giants headquartered there, and hostile toward user privacy.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/france-cnil-facebook-google-cookies-fine-112543645.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">46bbd165-67e2-49ce-8b40-3accb7e77dcc</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 11:25:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641467334</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T11:09:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2020-04/f3b8c070-7999-11ea-9d9d-0d8bf585a053" width="4256" height="2832" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2020-04/f3b8c070-7999-11ea-9d9d-0d8bf585a053" width="4256" height="2832" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LIONEL BONAVENTURE via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A picture taken on January 29, 2013 shows France's computer technology watchdog CNIL (Commisson Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes) sign in Paris.

Now, Nike has filed a lawsuit against the company over Mirror, accusing it of patent infringement. According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/05/nike-sues-lululemon-for-patent-infringement-over-at-home-mirror-gym-and-fitness-apps.html"><em>CNBC</em></a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nike-sues-lululemon-for-patent-infringement-over-mirror-fitness-technology-11641429626"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, Nike&#39;s lawsuit allege that Mirror — a full-size interactive mirror that brings a live fitness instructor into the user&#39;s home — and its apps use technologies that it invented and patented.&nbsp;</p><p>The sports apparel giant specifically mentioned that it filed a patent application in 1983 for a device that can prompt users to exercise, monitor their heart rate, determine their speed while running and the calories they burned. Nike also has a number of mobile apps for fitness, including the Nike Run Club and Nike Training Club.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Nike sent Lululemon a list of patents it allegedly infringed on back on November 3rd. As you&#39;d expect, the company more known for making yoga pants and other types of gym clothes disagreed with Nike&#39;s assessment. A spokesperson told the publications in a statement that the patents &quot;in question are overly broad and invalid.&quot; They also said that Lululemon is confident in its position and &quot;look forward to defending it in court.&quot;</p><p>Mirror operates as a standalone company within Lululemon, putting the workout clothes-maker in direct competition with the likes of Peloton and Tonal. Lululemon CEO Clavin McDonald previously <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lululemon-ceo-explains-why-it-bought-mirror-170336105.html">said</a> that the purchase was all about connecting with consumers, because they&#39;re bound to spend more the more they engage with the brand. Last month, however, the company <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lululemon-slashes-sales-estimate-for-its-mirror-brand-growth-slows-2021-12">halved</a> its sales forecast for the device, calling 2021 &quot;a challenging year for digital fitness.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>This isn&#39;t the only patent-related legal battle Lululemon is embroiled in. Last year, it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/30/business/lululemon-peloton-lawsuit.html">filed</a> a patent infringement lawsuit of its own against Peloton, alleging that the design the other company used for a new line of leggings and sports bras infringe on its intellectual property.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/nike-sues-lululemon-over-mirror-home-gym-081555042.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">47c94904-62ec-4217-af21-7f03767caff7</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 06 Jan 2022 08:15:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641456956</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T08:16:06+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Health]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Fitness]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c3dd6c80-6ebf-11ec-976f-cc7282b53310" width="1600" height="1026" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/c3dd6c80-6ebf-11ec-976f-cc7282b53310" width="1600" height="1026" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Lululemon/Mirror]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Mirror]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Mirror]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Some Facebook moderators can work from home following protests]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Meta&#39;s in-house staff won&#39;t have to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/meta-allows-return-to-office-deferrals-141013788.html">return to the office for months</a>, but some of its contracted workers are only now getting a similar reprieve. <em>BuzzFeed News</em> has <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/facebook-moderators-who-were-ordered-back-to-the-office-can">learned</a> subcontractor Accenture has scrapped a requirement that hundreds of Facebook moderators return to in-person work in Mountain View, California on January 24th.

The moderators said it was impossible to maintain Accenture&#39;s social distancing requirements given tightly packed offices, closed stairwells, and poor enforcement, and that the company didn&#39;t provide exemptions for immunocompromised workers or vulnerable family members.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>An Accenture spokesperson confirmed that moderators working from home &quot;should continue to do so&quot; based on COVID-19 health data, and claimed the company worked &quot;collaboratively&quot; to accommodate individuals in compliance with the law. Meta, meanwhile, said it would &quot;continue to prioritize&quot; the health and safety of all workers. Meta&#39;s own employees can defer returns to the office to as late as June.</p><p>These concerns aren&#39;t strictly new. Moderators accused Meta (then Facebook) in 2020 of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-content-moderators-coronavirus-protections-202420431.html">putting lives at risk</a> by asking some contractors to work from the office even when family members were highly vulnerable. Meta disputed some of the claims at the time, but not all.

The tech is different from your standard OLED in that it only uses blue organic light-emitting diodes. Those diodes then shine the light they produce through a series of quantum dots, allowing the panel to produce the full spectrum of color visible to the human eye. The approach has multiple advantages.</p><p>The most notable, particularly compared to current OLED displays, is that the panel can get a lot brighter. In a demo <a href="https://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1641348163"><em><ins>FlatspanelsHD</ins></em></a> saw at CES, one display produced more than 1,000 nits of peak brightness across a 10 percent window. For comparison, some of the more recent TVs from LG can produce between 700 nits and 1,000 nits of brightness across the same area. Brightness is something LG has consistently tried to address with its WOLD panels. In December, the company’s display subsidiary unveiled its “<a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-oled-ex-enhance-brightness-30-percent-095813152.html"><ins>OLED EX</ins></a>” tech, claiming it would enhance brightness by up to 30 percent compared to conventional OLED displays.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Another advantage of the technology is better color performance. The panels Samsung Display showed off at CES 2022 covered 90 percent of the Rec. 2020 color gamut. LG’s WOLED panels, which people consistently praise for their accurate and vibrant colors, hit about 70 percent of the Rec. 2020 standard. Lastly, viewing angles are improved. In addition to TVs, the technology will make its way to gaming monitors, with Samsung and Dell planning to use the tech in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/alienware-quantum-dot-oled-gaming-monitor-160035802.html">34-inch displays</a>.</p><p>We’ll have to see how the panels perform in the real world, but at least on paper, QD-OLED could easily become the new standard for high-end consumer TVs. One of the first companies set to release a TV with a QD-OLED panel is Sony with its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-2022-oled-mini-led-google-tv-lineup-150041942.html"><ins>A95K</ins></a> sets. Unfortunately, Sony has yet to announce how much those TVs will cost, and we won’t know until closer to release sometime this spring.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-qd-oled-215038108.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d29de600-da31-496c-9f46-7d7b40360258</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 21:50:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641419441</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T02:20:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/43fa4ad0-6e6d-11ec-adfc-acb1c802a76c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/43fa4ad0-6e6d-11ec-adfc-acb1c802a76c" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Samsung]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Samsung QD-OLED]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung QD-OLED]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Watch GM's Silverado EV reveal in 10 minutes]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<div id="629f9bd2c57c4315a786deb0b6c210b9"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNZR1ckXLlk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>GM had a lot to show off during its virtual CES 2022 keynote, including the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html">Chevrolet Silverado</a>, which is built on the company&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gm-is-placing-all-of-its-ev-eggs-in-the-ultum-battery-basket-163038784.html">Ultium battery platform</a>.

They&#39;re organizing under the auspices of the Alphabet Workers Union, a year-old division of the Communication Workers of America which is seeking to represent employees and contractors at all level of Google&#39;s parent company.&nbsp;</p><p>The 11 workers — 10 of whom have signed cards since the union drive began in October — are jointly employed by Google and a staffing agency called BDS Connected Solutions. That&#39;s not out of the ordinary, as staffing arrangements with Alphabet go: a 2019 story in the <em>New York Times</em> found temps and contractors made up <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html">the majority</a> of the tech giant&#39;s workforce, while a <em>Recode</em><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/5/31/18644866/google-contractors-pay-ratings-glassdoor">report</a> that same year indicated that this second class of laborers earned significantly less than Google&#39;s own full-time employees. According to two BDS workers who spoke to Engadget, customer representatives had been feeling left out of key conversations about staffing and safety protocols, and communication with management has deteriorated.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>&quot;We started off by just asking, &#39;Hey, how do you feel about this idea? Do you feel like you have enough say, in the conditions that you work in?&#39; We basically received a unanimous &#39;No, I don&#39;t feel like we do,&#39;&quot; Emrys Adair told Engadget. &quot;It hasn&#39;t always been like this,&quot; Mike Knox, who has been a Google Fiber representative for several years, said &quot;the general relationship between management and the workers. It used to be closer.&quot; Kansas City was the very <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-fiber-1-gigabit-internet-launches-in-kansas-city/">first market</a> Google Fiber launched in, nearly a decade ago.</p><p>What makes this push to form a bargaining unit somewhat unusual, however, has been the decision to skip straight to petitioning the National Labor Relations Board. Typically, this is the longer, more arduous option when an employer refuses to voluntarily recognize a union. But, according to Adair, Alphabet and BDS have neither attempted to quash the union drive, nor expressed a willingness to recognize it.&quot;There&#39;s been no acknowledgement, no pushback. no response at all yet,&quot; they said. Google and BDS have not responded to requests for comment from Engadget.</p><p>Like many workplaces in recent years, these service representatives have cycled through closures, reduced hours and the occasional need to isolate and work remotely when a colleague tests positive for COVID-19. While they weren&#39;t keen to give too many specifics as to what they&#39;d hope to secure in a first contract, one of the  benefits they&#39;re seeking to obtain is hazard pay. &quot;As far as the actual COVID precautions go, they&#39;ve done a pretty alright, job,&quot; Adair said. &quot;Our main concern is just that we&#39;re still working in the store in person in a pandemic, which in and of itself, no matter how you do that is a risk.&quot;</p><p>It may be months or years before the NLRB makes a ruling on these workers&#39; right to form a bargaining unit. In the meantime, Knox hopes it might spur action from others within Google Fiber. &quot;We&#39;re really hoping that this inspires in that regard,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;re hoping that&#39;s a flashpoint where other people can see that and decide to push for more input.&quot;</p><p><em>Are you a Google employee, TVC or contractor?

There&#39;s no steering wheel or pedals, of course. Instead, there&#39;s a built-in ottoman and a compartment for slippers and a blanket. Where GM&#39;s going, you won&#39;t need any sort of manual control.</p><div id="869d0e6dc9ec48289373dcd6b6579225"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBDJBKZg9iA?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p>Even stepping into the car seems like something from science fiction: the doors pop out, while the large windshield/sunroof rises up. As usual, concepts like the InnerSpace are a way for car designers to flex their muscles and imagine what future vehicles could actually be like. While it certainly seems out of reach for most people, perhaps Cadillac&#39;s more affluent clientele would be intrigued by owning a personal spaceship. At least it&#39;s better for the environment than full-sized luxury SUVs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“Electrification and autonomous driving will fundamentally change the role of vehicles and the experiences customers have with them,” Bryan Nesbitt, GM&#39;s executive director of Global Advanced Design, said in a statement. “We’re exploring where that will go with these innovative concepts, envisioning mobility as an ally of wellness, giving customers the ultimate luxury, more personal time rather than taking it.”</p><p>As someone who hates the act of driving, but lives in a place where I can&#39;t avoid it, it&#39;ll be interesting to see how car makers turn these self-driving concept vehicles into a reality. And maybe after getting these wild designs through their systems, they&#39;ll show us more concepts for self-driving family EVs.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/cadillac-innerspace-autonomous-concept-car-201347425.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8bcca169-048b-4aa6-8396-c2bd55d7f184</guid><dc:creator>Devindra Hardawar</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 20:13:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641413060</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T20:04:36+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Finance - Lifestyle]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Devindra Hardawar]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9811cff0-6e61-11ec-b1bf-cde05721dd38" width="2000" height="1334" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[GM]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Cadillac expands its vision of personal autonomous future mobility with the InnerSpace concept â a dramatic, two-passenger electric and autonomous luxury vehicle.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Cadillac Innerspace]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[HTC Vive reveals a VR wrist tracker for the Focus 3 headset]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HTC Vive" href="https://fave.co/3JJAKJk">HTC Vive</a> has revealed a wrist tracker for its <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">Focus 3 headset</a>. The device is 85 percent smaller and 50 percent lighter than the Vive Focus 3 controller.</p><p>The brand says the wearable can track your arm from fingertips to elbow. The Focus 3&#39;s cameras can monitor LEDs for standalone tracking. As such, attaching the Wrist Tracker to an object allows the headset to track it with six degrees of freedom.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>With the help of high-frequency IMU (inertial measurement unit) data and an advanced kinematic model, Focus 3 will still know the exact position of your hand and wrist when the tracker isn&#39;t in the cameras&#39; line of sight. It can predict your pose too, so if you, for instance, reach behind your head with a tennis racket to play a smash shot, the headset should still have a good idea of what you&#39;re doing.</p><p>The Vive Wrist Tracker will be released in early 2022, starting in the US. It costs $129/€129/£119. HTC Vive also revealed new accessories for the Focus 3, including a multi battery charger and charging case, in part to reduce downtime between sessions.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-virtual-reality-wrist-tracker-focus-3-195333828.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">af0c1dad-2a31-4605-89fe-2dfbe1eda46b</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 19:53:33 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641414711</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T02:21:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4c17c490-6e5e-11ec-8f2e-7bc65fa40e60" width="3000" height="1687" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4c17c490-6e5e-11ec-8f2e-7bc65fa40e60" width="3000" height="1687" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[HTC Vive]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A person's arm wearing an HTC Vive Wrist Tracker.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[HTC Vive Wrist Tracker]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Lyft and Kakao drivers can soon take ride requests through Android Auto]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many ride hailing drivers won&#39;t have to mount their phones in the near future.

The wrap is embedded with millions of microcapsules each containing a negatively-charged white pigment and a positively charged-black pigment. Depending on the setting, applying an electrical charge to the material will cause either the white or black pigments to rise to the top of the microcapsule, changing the vehicle&#39;s color in moments.&nbsp;</p><p>While the current iteration can only swap between a pair of colors, the palette could eventually be expanded to display a rainbow&#39;s worth of differing shades. &quot;This gives the driver the freedom to express different facets of their personality or even their enjoyment of change outwardly, and to redefine this each time they sit into their car,&quot; Stella Clarke, Head of Project for the BMW iX Flow featuring E Ink, said in a prepared statement. &quot;Similar to fashion or the status ads on social media channels, the vehicle then becomes an expression of different moods and circumstances in daily life.&quot;</p><p>E-ink exterior displays could also prove useful in more practical applications such as changing colors depending on the weather to increase a vehicle&#39;s battery life (and therefore, range) in cold climates or reduce the need for air conditioning in balmy weather.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/bm-ws-color-changing-car-concept-works-just-like-an-e-reader-190051033.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">30f802d9-7499-42bf-b31b-ca93337b734f</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 19:00:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641336068</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T02:21:49+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/052bdbe0-6da3-11ec-bf9f-aab4b9ca3980" width="2200" height="1238" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/052bdbe0-6da3-11ec-bf9f-aab4b9ca3980" width="2200" height="1238" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[BMW]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[the iFlow e-ink system from BMW]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[the iFlow e-ink system]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[GM teases electric versions of its Chevy Blazer and Equinox SUVs]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>GM&#39;s electric vehicle debuts at CES 2022 involve much more than just <a href="https://www.engadget.com/chevrolet-silverado-ev-details-ces-debut-171551300.html">the Chevy Silverado</a>.

The company has started to test the new versions of its feed, which will allow users to switch between chronological and algorithmically-sorted feeds, says Instagram chief Adam Mosseri.</p><p>Mosseri first shared plans to bring back a chronological feed in December during a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/senate-hearing-instagram-adam-mosseri-001751448.html"><ins>Senate hearing</ins></a> on Instagram’s impact on teens and kids’ mental health.

Home will be similar to Instagram’s current feed, which ranks posts based on what you&#39;re likely to be interested in, while “favorites” will be a dedicated feed for the friends you care most about. “Following” will be a chronological feed just for accounts you follow, much like Instagram’s default feed prior to 2016.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/e8617470-6e51-11ec-be7f-f6d22319dfe0" style="height:732;width:1050;" alt="Instagram plans to roll out anew chronological feed." data-uuid="34f8dbc4-ac42-32c3-bc80-0efef4491d6e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot via Twitter</div></figure><p>“We think it&#39;s important that you can get to a chronological feed, if you&#39;re interested quickly and see the latest that has been posted by the accounts that you follow,” Mosseri said in a video.</p><p>Importantly, the “home” feed will also see significant changes. Mosseri said that the main feed would “have more and more recommendations over time.” The company has already been testing adding recommendations from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-suggested-posts-feed-191126529.html"><ins>non-followed accounts</ins></a> and Reels into its main feed, so it sounds like Instagram plans to double down on these efforts.

Mosseri said the new feed tests “are already out or going out over the next couple of weeks,” with the “full experience” expected to launch for everyone in the “first half of this year.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-tests-chronological-feed-181947259.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8921cbdd-4bd0-49c8-8f65-05dfcb67cd9f</guid><dc:creator>Karissa Bell</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 18:19:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641406787</ingested><modified>2022-01-05T18:19:57+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Karissa Bell]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/07d62b60-6e53-11ec-bbe7-17acef150778" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/07d62b60-6e53-11ec-bbe7-17acef150778" width="6000" height="4000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[In this photo illustration Instagram logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in Athens, Greece on April 13, 2021 (Photo Illustration by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images)]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[App Photo Illustrations]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volvo will debut its 'self-driving' Ride Pilot feature in California]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Volvo will debut “Ride Pilot,” its take on a Tesla-like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-10-beta-145035031.html">autonomous driving feature</a>, in California, the automaker announced on Wednesday during CES 2022. Once it’s approved for use on highways, Volvo says it will offer Ride Pilot as a paid subscription add-on for a new electric SUV it plans to reveal later this year. It will later bring the feature to other markets globally.</p><p>The company worked with Zenseact and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-luminar-lidar-built-in-self-driving-cars-161838644.html">LiDAR developer Luminar</a> to create Ride Pilot, and it’s currently testing the feature in Sweden. As you might guess from Luminar’s involvement, Ride Pilot will utilize LiDAR technology, an approach that puts Volvo at odds with Tesla. CEO Elon Musk famously called the tech a “crutch” during a 2018 earnings call. According to Volvo, Ride Pilot will utilize a Luminar Iris LiDAR sensor complemented by eight cameras, 16 ultrasonic sensors and five radars to enable the software to judge depth. Additionally, the company says it will push out continuous over-the-air updates to ensure the feature is safe to use.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>“When we say self-driving, we mean self-driving. So this will be a feature or function where the car is actually responsible for the driving so you will not need to keep your hands on the steering wheel and you will not need to keep your eyes off the road,” said Martin Kristensson, head of AD and mobility at Volvo.</p><p>Volvo says it will start testing Ride Pilot in California by the middle of 2022. It picked the state for its favourable regulatory stance on autonomous vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/volvo-ride-pilot-181545657.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b27f6d60-f353-4111-8e52-d16485b1aff3</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 18:15:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641408917</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T02:23:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Autos]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd19e8b0-6e52-11ec-bf4c-1aada46c0efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/fd19e8b0-6e52-11ec-bf4c-1aada46c0efc" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Volvo]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Volvo Ride Pilot]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Volvo Ride Pilot]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Volvo is bringing YouTube and Google Home integration to its vehicles]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/volvo/">Volvo</a> says it will be the first automaker to offer direct integration with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/google%20home/">Google Home</a> in its cars. You&#39;ll be able to control certain functions remotely via Google Assistant. You might tell your phone to lock the doors or ask a smart speaker to start warming up your car as you&#39;re getting ready to leave home.</p><p>Two-factor authentication is needed for &quot;more sensitive commands,&quot; like unlocking the doors.

Volvo will roll out Google Home integration in the coming months.

Still, Google Home is one of the more prominent connected home platforms around. If you have a smart speaker with Google Assistant enabled, these features might come in useful.</p><p>In addition, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/youtube/">YouTube</a> will be the first video streaming service on Volvo&#39;s infotainment system. You&#39;ll be able to download the app from the Play Store. The automaker offers unlimited data in certain markets, so you might be able to watch as many videos as you like without worrying about busting your data allowance.</p><p>For safety reasons, you&#39;ll only be able to watch YouTube videos on the screen when the car&#39;s stationary. That will ensure Volvo avoids the kind of controversy Tesla was embroiled in recently, when it emerged that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-touchscreen-video-games-driving-165327545.html">games were playable</a> on the infotainment system while a car was moving. The company said it would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-passenger-play-gaming-disabled-214634365.html">disable that option</a> after the NHTSA said it was <a href="http://nhtsa/">looking into the matter</a>.</p><p>Other apps that Volvo owners will soon be able to download to their infotainment system include navigation apps Sygic and Flitsmeister; charging apps ChargePoint and Plugshare; and parking services SpotHero and ParkWhiz.</p><p>Earlier this week, Volvo <a href="https://www.engadget.com/volvo-polestar-3-infotainment-system-qualcomm-android-automotive-191520806.html">announced</a> it will use Qualcomm&#39;s car chipsets to power the infotainment systems in Polestar 3 and its upcoming electric EV.

It&#39;s announcing a set of news today <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/ces%202022/">at CES 2022</a> that are designed to help those using non-Apple devices easily set up, connect and share seamlessly across platforms. That involves expanding its existing Fast Pair and Chromecast capabilities to more products, as well as improving the sharing of data between Android phones and laptops. In fact, Google said that &quot;for the first time with Android, we&#39;re also focused on building for other platforms, like Windows.&quot;</p><p>First, Fast Pair. Google is working with Acer, HP and Intel to bring <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-10-31-android-fast-pair-will-quickly-connect-bluetooth-devices.html">Fast Pair</a> to Windows PCs so you can quickly connect your Android phone to your laptop. You can then set up Bluetooth accessories, sync your text messages and easily share files via Nearby Share. This feature will arrive on select Windows PCs later this year.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Meanwhile, Google is also bringing Fast Pair to devices beyond wearables, cars and Bluetooth audio accessories, to include things like TVs and smart devices. It already works with the Pixel Buds and some Fitbit watches, enabling easier setup on those devices. In a few weeks, your Chromebook can automatically detect your Fast Pair-enabled headphones when you turn them on, allowing you to connect to them in a single click. New Chromebooks arriving later this year will be easier to set up, too. You can connect your Android phone and port over saved data like your Google account and Wi-Fi password.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f981ae20-6e4f-11ec-b76f-3a26ba3bb028" alt="A pop-up dialog on an Android TV asking if the user wants to connect their detected Pixel Buds." data-uuid="3506705b-67bb-3376-a2e0-01edec5dc94e"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>The company said it&#39;ll let you connect headphones to Google TV or Android TV in the coming months, and that Fast Pair will work with new Matter-enabled smart home devices as well. That should make adding connected appliances to your home network easier than before. It doesn&#39;t sound as simple as Apple&#39;s HomePod setup where you can just hold your iPhone near your speaker to trigger the installation process, but we&#39;ll have to wait to see Google&#39;s solution in action to know for sure.</p><p>After your gadgets are all set up and synced with each other, Google also wants to enable convenient connections a la Apple&#39;s AirPlay or AirDrop. It&#39;s bringing Cast support to more brands, starting with all Bose smart speakers and soundbars, so you can stream music and audio from your Android phone to compatible speakers.&nbsp;</p><p>The company is also &quot;building a technology for Bluetooth-enabled headphones&quot; that will let them automatically switch audio output depending on what device you&#39;re using. Say you&#39;re wearing earbuds while watching a show on your Android tablet and a call comes in on your phone. The system will pause your movie and the headphones will switch over to your phone, then go right back to your tablet when your conversation is over. This will work for all audio playing through your devices at a system level, rather than on a supported-app-only basis. For Apple users, this is similar to how AirPods can automatically switch between iPads, iPhones and Macs.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/27af1f30-6e50-11ec-8ff8-0a706ce97196" alt="An animation showing how audio switching between an Android tablet and phone works when a call comes in on the latter." data-uuid="6ea12a4e-1bd7-3451-9ca8-96194997ef6f"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Google</div></figure><p>Google says compatible headphones will also get spatial audio support so you can hear directional sound based on your head&#39;s movements for more immersive experiences. These features are coming in the next few months.</p><p>Later this year, Phone Hub on Chromebooks is also getting new features to make it more useful. For example, you won&#39;t have to install separate apps like Signal or WhatsApp on your laptop to message your friends via your phone anymore. Messages from chat apps will show up on your Chromebook and you can reply to them from there. Google is also adding Camera Roll to the Phone Hub so you can view your media without opening photos.google.com.&nbsp;</p><p>Locking and unlocking devices and vehicles is also getting easier. Just like you can with Apple Watch (and some Samsung devices), in the coming months you&#39;ll be able to use your paired Wear OS 3 watch to keep your Chromebook and Android devices unlocked when you&#39;re close by.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/4f562f10-6e50-11ec-bb7f-21e9cc976633" alt="An animation showing a phone and a Chromebook.

Compatible Samsung or Pixel phones will now be able to lock, unlock and start supported BMW vehicles. Later this year, too, phones with ultra wideband support can open car doors without leaving your pocket or purse. Google is also adding support for key sharing, in compliance with the Connected Car Consortium interoperable standard, so you can remotely share access to your vehicle right from your phone. The company said it&#39;s &quot;working to bring digital car keys to more Android phones and vehicles later this year.&quot;</p><p>Finally, you&#39;ll also be able to tell the Google Assistant to warm up, cool down, lock and unlock your car and ask it for the amount of battery left in your EV. This is coming first to Volvo Cars vehicles in the coming months, &quot;with more to follow,&quot; according to Google.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything Google announced today fits in with the vision of ambient computing the company has talked about for years. &quot;This is sort of a foundational element for us to achieve the vision of ambient computing,&quot; vice president of multi-device experiences Erik Kay told Engadget. It does seem like when these updates do roll out, non-Apple users may have less reason to envy the seamless ecosystem that iPhone or Mac users enjoy.</p><p><em>Follow all of the latest news from CES 2022 </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/CES%202022/"><em>right here</em></a><em>!</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/google-ces-2022-news-fast-pair-nearby-share-windows-chrome-cast-180055389.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a522fec6-f6bd-4193-b36a-e759b8061bea</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 05 Jan 2022 18:00:55 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1641476526</ingested><modified>2022-01-06T13:42:24+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Information Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Smart Phones]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a5f92af0-6e4d-11ec-9f7f-19c3c871d8f2" width="1600" height="902" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a5f92af0-6e4d-11ec-9f7f-19c3c871d8f2" width="1600" height="902" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Google]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A banner showing a Chromebook, Android phone, smartwatch, tablet and part of a TV, surrounded by Google-style illustrations of icons for microphone, camera and GPS.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Google Multi Device banner]]></media:title></media:content></item></channel></rss>
