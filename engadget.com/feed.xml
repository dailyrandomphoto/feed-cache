Over the last few years, smaller sizes, better battery life and hands-free features have become the norm, but there’s only so much you can do on such a tiny device.</p><p>In 2021, Jabra set the new standard for affordable wireless earbuds with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html"><ins>the Elite 3</ins></a>. At $80, it covers most of the basics quite well.Now the company is improving its mid-range option with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-true-wireless-earbuds-announced-price-specs-152938907.html"><ins>the Elite 4 Active</ins></a>. It’s a more workout-focused model, complete with active noise cancellation (ANC) and enough moisture protection for the sweatiest of sessions. Like it did last year, Jabra is seeking to not only make its true wireless lineup compelling in terms of features and performance, but to also make the price more competitive. T<a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:his $120 model" href="https://amzn.to/3nq6ytd">his $120 model</a> delivers a lot of options that we typically see on earbuds that go for $150-$180.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Elite 4 Active carries Jabra’s new design that debuted on the Elite 3, Elite 7 Active and Elite 7 Pro last year. Instead of a mostly circular earbud with an elbow that holds the microphones, the company switched to a rounded triangle shape that offers a cleaner look. Most importantly, all of Jabra’s latest earbuds are significantly smaller than their predecessors and the Elite 4 Active continues that trend. The smaller size not only means these buds don’t stick out from your ears as much, but they’re also lighter and more comfy.</p><p>I wouldn’t blame you for mistaking the Elite 4 Active for the Elite 3. Aesthetically, the main difference is the outer panel on the 3 is one big button, while that area on the 4 Active is seamless. The button is there, but it’s sealed off. Jabra increased the water resistance to IP57 for this model, and the onboard controls are one area where it had to increase protection. Of course, Jabra has always designed its earbuds with the Active label for workouts. Better sweat protection is usually part of that formula.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/00e305e3-74ba-11ec-bffb-90a988efc117" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Jabra continues to revamp its true wireless lineup with compelling options at affordable prices. With the Elite 4 Active, you get upgrades like ANC and better water resistance over the base model Elite 3. Sound quality is good and battery life is solid, which helps make up for the lack of premium conveniences. " data-uuid="c57e6aee-ae1a-379d-b836-db1f598dcd18"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>The lack of a defined panel or button proved to be an issue for me when accessing the controls. I had to train myself to remember to press in the middle of the earbud as getting too far to the top or bottom wouldn’t register my actions. The outer surface of the Elite 4 Active is completely smooth, without so much as a raised dot to indicate you’re in the right place. Over time I might get used to this, but after a couple weeks of testing, I’m still not nailing it consistently.</p><p>Like every other Jabra model, you can tailor the Elite 4 Active to your needs via the company’s Sound+ app. Since this set is Jabra’s mid-range option, you get more features than the entry-level Elite 3, but not quite as much as the Elite 7 Pro or Elite 7 Active. First, there’s ANC and it’s customizable. Notice I didn’t say <em>adjustable</em>. Specifically, the app lets you set a level of noise cancellation during initial setup. You can also tweak the balance if you need more on one side than the other. Jabra will allow you to repeat this process if you need to, but there’s no easily accessible slider like the Elite 7 models.</p><p>The company’s transparency mode, HearThrough, can be controlled in the app via a slider. In fact, you can even set what the on-board control for sound mode does (single press on the left side). You can have it cycle through HearThrough and ANC, HearThrough and off or HearThrough, ANC and off. The app also allows you to turn on and off Sidetone, which lets you hear your voice when you’re on a call. Unlike some Jabra models, it isn’t adjustable – just all or nothing. Still, being able to hear yourself so you’re a bit less shouty over Zoom is better for everyone. The company’s own Find My feature returns as well, helping you locate a misplaced earbud if you’re willing to give it the proper permissions. And on Android, you can opt for one-touch access to Spotify if that’s your preferred streaming service.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/00e305e0-74ba-11ec-bfff-1dd3c0fb99f1" style="height:1333;width:2000;" alt="Jabra continues to revamp its true wireless lineup with compelling options at affordable prices. With the Elite 4 Active, you get upgrades like ANC and better water resistance over the base model Elite 3.

" data-uuid="192be981-ae78-3073-ba1a-9bce1686fb22"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>For a $120 set of earbuds, I wouldn’t blame you for not expecting too much in the sound department. However, Jabra has a track record of solid audio across its true wireless lineup. With the Elite 4 Active, the company maintains its reputation for buds that sound good, but not great. There’s decent clarity and nice detail, but they lack the wider soundstage and depth pricier models from the likes of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-wf-1000xm4-review-160006474.html"><ins>Sony</ins></a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-03-19-sennheiser-momentum-true-wireless-2-review.html"><ins>Sennheiser</ins></a> offer.</p><p>The Elite 4 Active has pretty good sonic range, but big bombastic tracks like Run The Jewels “Mean Demeanor” and Gojira’s “Another World” sound overly compressed. The bass is solid and not muddy, so keeping the energy up during workouts with hip hop, EDM, or isn’t a problem. It’s just that on the whole, songs lack the dimensional punch you can find with a bigger investment. For $120 though, the Elite 4 Active gets the job done in most cases.</p><p>If you find yourself yearning to tweak the EQ, you can do that in the Sound+ app via a set of sliders. If one-tap audio changes are more your style, Jabra also offers a collection of presets for quick customization. It’s not the most robust set of options for dialing in the sound, but it’s more than you get on the ultra affordable Elite 3.</p><p>One advantage the Elite 4 Active has over the Elite 3 is active noise cancellation. As I mentioned, you can customize the feature to a degree, but it’s not as powerful as what’s on Jabra’s pricer earbuds. Still, the ANC here will help block out some distractions, just don’t expect it to do a lot of heavy lifting.</p><p>The Elite 4 Active has four microphones for calls. Jabra says they’re covered with a “special mesh” to reduce wind noise when you’re outdoors. Typically, mileage varies greatly on call quality with true wireless earbuds. Most of the time you just end up sounding like you’re on speakerphone. With the Elite 4 Active, the call quality is slightly better, but still not as good as if you had a microphone closer to your mouth – or even pointed more towards your face. Background noise is reduced when you’re talking, but any environmental roar is distracting when you’re not.</p><core-slideshow data-slideshowid="f37de552-4588-4246-b24a-6321b5ec3595"/><p>Jabra says you can expect up to seven hours of battery life on the Elite 4 Active, with three additional charges in the case for a total of 28 hours. The company doesn’t specify whether or not that’s with ANC on, but in my tests I managed seven and a half hours with noise canceling active. It’s by no means the best battery life you’ll find in true wireless earbuds, but it’s certainly enough to get you through a workday if you take a break or two. If you run out of juice before you head out the door, a quick charge feature gives you an hour of use in 10 minutes.</p><p><a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:At $120" href="https://amzn.to/3nq6ytd">At $120</a>, Jabra is offering solid mid-range specs at the same price as some companies’ budget models. What’s more, most of those don’t offer ANC, let alone a transparency mode or customizable sound. Samsung put noise canceling inside of its cheapest true wireless model with the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html"><ins>Galaxy Buds 2</ins></a>. These earbuds are tiny and comfy and wireless charging is included, but the ANC performance is just okay. Plus, the Galaxy Buds 2 are only IPX2 rated, so you’ll want to be careful about how wet you get them. Full price they’re $150, but we’ve seen them <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsungs-galaxy-buds-2-are-back-on-sale-for-100-143041841.html"><ins>as low as $100</ins></a>.</p><p>If you’re looking to maximize your dollars, I’d suggest looking into Anker’s Soundcore line. You can find a lot of value, and features, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-spirit-dot-2-spirit-x2-review-183052156.html"><ins>for well under $100</ins></a> there. Plus, the company’s top-of-the-line flagship ANC model, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/anker-soundcore-liberty-3-pro-true-wireless-earbuds-100052557.html"><ins>the Liberty 3 Pro</ins></a>, is <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:only $170" href="https://amzn.to/34E5QlA">only $170</a>. And if you’re good with passive noise isolation, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-3-review-120031350.html"><ins>Jabra’s own Elite 3</ins></a> can get the job done <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:for $60" href="https://amzn.to/3KkwjVU">for $60</a>.</p><p>If Jabra’s new mission is to deliver the same overall quality as its previous earbuds at more affordable prices, I’m here for it. With the Elite 4 Active, as it did with the Elite 3, the company has managed to offer a compelling set of features at a great price. It hasn’t cut corners to do so, improving details like design and fit while maintaining its standard for sound quality. There are some omissions, but all the basics are covered and for the most part done well. Once again, we have more evidence that you don’t need to spend over $150 in order to get a set of good true wireless earbuds.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/jabra-elite-4-active-review-140024466.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7f2a5b69-54f8-4281-adfd-2758abc415ff</guid><dc:creator>Billy Steele</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 14:00:24 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642112077</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T22:14:54+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Billy Steele]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9844d670-74ba-11ec-bfb7-f97ed564d065" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9844d670-74ba-11ec-bfb7-f97ed564d065" width="2000" height="1333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 4 Active review]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Jabra Elite 4 Active review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Final Fantasy XIV' will go back on sale on January 25th]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>New players will be able to purchase digital copies of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> again starting on January 25th, the game&#39;s director and producer Naoki Yoshida has <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/9a6bed5c06ae511c363ece5ead0a98a3986554a2">announced</a> in a lengthy post. Square Enix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/square-enix-suspends-final-fantasy-xiv-sales-114053735.html">suspended</a> the game&#39;s physical and digital sales in mid-December last year, because it was doing too well for what the company could handle at the time. People have had to wait hours to get in when they try to play at peak times, because the &quot;dense concentration of play hours... far exceed [the game&#39;s] server capacity.&quot; Unfortunately, the developer wasn&#39;t able to add more servers before the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xiv-online-endwalker-november-23rd-214301453.html"><em>Endwalker</em></a> expansion was released due to the global semiconductor shortage.&nbsp;</p><p>In his post, Yoshida explained the steps the company is taking to address the game&#39;s high levels of congestion. To start with, Square Enix is bringing its Oceanian Data Center online also on January 25th and opening five new Worlds from the start so that everyone in Oceania can transfer over for a better experience. The world transfer service is currently suspended, but it will resume on January 26th — further, those transferring to the new Oceanian Worlds will be able to do so for free.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Yoshida has also revealed that Square Enix has been working on expanding its Japanese, European and North American data centers. The company explained that due to the global semiconductor shortage, it took some time to procure the needed components to be able to bring them online. In fact, it has to establish the new data centers in phases, because it&#39;s still having a tough time securing the necessary server equipment.&nbsp;</p><p>For North America, the first phase of the expansion will happen sometime in August 2022, and it will see four new Worlds go online. The second phase will be implemented in the summer of 2023 and will open four more Worlds.  For Japan, the developer plans to add one more logical data center to the current three in order to lower the number of Worlds for each of them. The European expansion will also happen in two phases, the first of which is scheduled for July 2022 and will bring four new Worlds online. In the summer of 2023, Square Enix will establish one new logical data center with eight new Worlds in Europe.&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;Once again, I wish to apologize for the delays to server expansion caused by the global semiconductor shortage,&quot; Yoshida wrote. He also asked for players&#39; understanding in resuming sales of the game, even though some may consider the decision to be premature. Square Enix will monitor server stability following the resumption of sales and could restart free trials if everything goes well. However, in case servers &quot;continue to experience extreme levels of congestion&quot; despite all the steps it&#39;s taking, the developer may consider suspending digital sales once again.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/final-fantasy-xiv-back-on-sale-january-25th-133146587.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">24ba88cf-cb91-40b3-8acd-8f7a99a3649a</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 13:31:46 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642168144</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T13:49:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a76abdf0-7540-11ec-bbef-29b500b81f4e" width="1600" height="994" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a76abdf0-7540-11ec-bbef-29b500b81f4e" width="1600" height="994" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Square Enix]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Microsoft opens a third-party review into its harassment and discrimination policies]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has hired a third -party law firm to review its policies on sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22883416/microsoft-board-harassment-discrimination-report"><em>The Verge</em></a> has reported. As part of that, the final report will summarize the results of sexual harassment investigations against the company&#39;s senior leadership and board of directors, including  former CEO Bill Gates.&nbsp;</p><p>The report will &quot;lead to the public release of a transparency report assessing the effectiveness of the company&#39;s workplace sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, training, and related policies,&quot; Microsoft said in a <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/MSBoardPolicy.docx?version=cc15d925-d108-b21f-6313-cb68323e4c56">press release</a>.

The review will also include an analysis of policies, practices, and commitments to create a safe, inclusive work environment.</p></blockquote><p>Microsoft had been planning to disclose how it implements sexual harassment and gender discrimination policies, with a key request being the disclosure of executive-level investigations. However, late last year, Microsoft shareholders <a href="https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-sexual-harassment-annual-report-shareholder-vote-113826396.html">forced the company</a> to write up an annual report detailing how it handles sexual harassment cases within the company.&nbsp;</p><p>The review will be conducted by the law firm Arent Fox and will look at allegations of discrimination and harassment arising from an internal <a href="https://qz.com/1587477/microsoft-investigating-sexual-harassment-claims-overlooked-by-hr/">Microsoft email chain</a> back in 2019. In over 90 pages of emails, female employees alleged that they were harassed and denied promotions and pay raises, among other issues. They further complained that managers and the company&#39;s HR department took no action in many cases. Microsoft was also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-03-13-microsoft-faces-238-complaints-of-gender-discrimination-harassment.html">accused</a> of 238 cases of gender discrimination or sexual harassment in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>While the board will assess the previous investigation against Gates, it won&#39;t reinvestigate the affair that happened in 2000. Gates resigned from Microsoft&#39;s board in early March of 2020, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/microsoft-directors-decided-bill-gates-needed-to-leave-board-due-to-prior-relationship-with-staffer-11621205803">reportedly</a> before the investigation was complete.</p><p>&quot;We’re committed not just to reviewing the report but learning from the assessment so we can continue to improve the experiences of our employees,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said in a statement. “I embrace this comprehensive review as an opportunity to continue to get better.&quot;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/microsoft-hires-an-outside-firm-to-review-its-harassment-and-discrimination-policies-132048142.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">c0200492-ec42-429e-9673-1a617a4ba7c0</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 13:20:48 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642164961</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T12:56:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f4af8c10-7533-11ec-a7dd-2dec09071318" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/f4af8c10-7533-11ec-a7dd-2dec09071318" width="5184" height="3456" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Charles Platiau / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[General view of Microsoft Corporation headquarters at Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris,  France, April 18, 2016.

Take the Xperia 5 III. After launching in other regions <em>last year</em>, the phone is only now available stateside for $1,000. This is its middle-ish high-end phone, with the flagship Xperia 1 series of smartphones (seen above) both bigger and pricier.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-high-end-compact-xperia-5-iii-comes-to-the-us-for-1000-095934384.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/9131cfc0-7535-11ec-8fff-5d8b67023191" style="height:380;width:675;" alt="TMA" data-uuid="0b89caea-854b-3b8d-8d14-c4c9cda03c86"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Sony</div></figure></a><p>For that price, this Xperia does have things to offer. The autofocus tricks, courtesy of Sony’s camera arm, are often impressive. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sonys-high-end-compact-xperia-5-iii-comes-to-the-us-for-1000-095934384.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">The Xperia 5 III</a> can also record 4K video at up to 120 fps; it’s a camera-first smartphone designed for folks who are really into photography or video. But, well, that’s true of all of Sony’s recent phones. And if you’re dying for truly cutting-edge smartphone photography, perhaps the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-xperia-pro-i-announcement-031222484.html%20https://www.engadget.com/...">Xperia Pro-I</a>, with a 1-inch camera sensor, would fulfill the brief more clearly.

Resolution is up considerably to 33 megapixels, and image quality is much improved overall. Video is now on par with rivals with 4K at up to 60p with 10 bit 4:2:2 quality. Autofocus is incredible for both video and stills, and the in-body stabilization does a good job. The biggest drawbacks are the relatively high price and the rolling shutter that limits use of the electronic shutter. Steve Dent puts the newest, best Sony camera to the test.

The plaintiffs — two users from California and one from Chicago — are accusing the company of unlawfully seizing their personal property and violating racketeering laws. They&#39;re now proposing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of all other users who&#39;ve had their accounts frozen before and are seeking restitution, as well as punitive and exemplary damages.</p><p>Lena Evans, one of the plaintiffs who&#39;d been a PayPal user for 22 years, said the website seized $26,984 from her account six months after it got frozen without ever telling her why. Evans had been using PayPal to buy and sell clothing on eBay, to exchange money for a poker league she owns and for a non-profit that helps women with various needs.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Fellow plaintiff Roni Shemtov said PayPal seized over $42,000 of her money and never got an acceptable reason for why her account was terminated. She received several different explanations when she contacted the company: One customer rep said it was because she used the same IP and computer as other Paypal users, while another said it was because she sold yoga clothing at 20 to 30 percent lower than retail. Yet another representative allegedly said it was because she used multiple accounts, which she denies.&nbsp;</p><p>Shbadan Akylbekov, the third plaintiff, said PayPal seized over $172,000 of his money without giving him any explanation why the account got limited in the first place. Akylbekov used the account of a company his wife owns to sell Hyaluron pens, which are needle-less pens that inject hyaluronic acid into the skin. After the money disappeared from the account following a six-month freeze, PayPal allegedly sent his wife a letter that says she &quot;violated PayPal&#39;s User Agreement and Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) by accepting payments for the sale of injectable fillers not approved by the FDA.&quot; It also said that the money was taken from her account &quot;for its liquidated damages arising from those AUP violations pursuant to the User Agreement.&quot;</p><p>PayPal has long angered many a user for limiting accounts and freezing their funds for six months or more. One high-profile case was American poker player Chris Moneymaker&#39;s who had $12,000 taken from his account after six months of being limited. Moneymaker was already in the process of <a href="https://www.poker.org/chris-moneymaker-to-sue-paypal-for-12000-in-seized-funds/">asking people</a> to join him in a class action lawsuit before his funds were &quot;mysteriously returned.&quot;&nbsp;</p><p>Part of the complaint reads:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;Plaintiffs bring this class action against Defendant PAYPAL, INC. (&quot;PayPal&quot;) to recover damages and other relief available at law and in equity on behalf of themselves, as well as on behalf of the members of the class defined herein... This action stems from Defendant’s widespread business practice of unilaterally seizing funds from its clients’ financial accounts, without cause and without any fair or due process.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>PayPal places a &quot;hold&quot; on Plaintiffs&#39; own funds in their own PayPal accounts. PayPal has failed to inform Plaintiffs and members of the class of the reason(s) for the actions PayPal has taken, even telling Plaintiffs and members of the class that they will &quot;have to get a subpoena&quot; to learn the simple information as to why PayPal was holding, and denying Plaintiffs, access to their own money.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/paypal-lawsuit-freezing-customer-accounts-funds-073128563.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">18f5b3b4-9cea-4f5f-8f80-57263face538</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 07:31:28 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642145490</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T07:31:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-08/4acebb90-cb52-11e9-8bfc-78096ef73d84" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/4acebb90-cb52-11e9-8bfc-78096ef73d84" width="5616" height="3744" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[serg3d via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[San Jose, USA - June 27, 2015: PayPal Headquarters]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[PayPal Headquarters]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Facebook's Spanish-language moderators have reportedly been working in unsafe conditions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s no secret Meta employs <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-03-facebook-will-hire-3-000-moderators-to-prevent-livestreamed-viol.html">contract laborers</a> to do much of the hard work of enforcing its content moderation policies on Facebook. And despite assisting one of the most valuable companies in the world, those workers have frequently complained of their jobs involving poor compensation and anxiety-inducing work. Some are now also saying they’re being treated worse than other workers.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahemerson/facebooks-spanish-language-moderators-said-theyre-treated"><em>BuzzFeed News</em></a>, Genpact, a Meta subcontractor that has previously been accused of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-content-india-feature-idUSKCN1QH15I">fostering poor working conditions</a>, has required the Spanish-language moderators out of its Richardson, Texas office to report for in-person work since April 2021. Those workers have had to put their health at risk against both the delta and omicron coronavirus variants while their English-language counterparts have been allowed to cycle through the office in three-month rotations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The news of the situation at Genpact comes just one week after workers at Accenture, another Meta subcontractor, successfully protested to force the company to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-moderators-work-from-home-223951103.html">scrap a requirement</a> it had in place for hundreds of Facebook moderators to return to in-person work on January 24th.</p><p>Contractors who spoke to <em>BuzzFeed News </em>claim Genpact also holds them to unreasonable standards. They say they’re expected to make moderation decisions in about a minute while maintaining an 85 percent accuracy rate. Complicating everything is the fact that Meta reportedly doesn’t disseminate guidelines on how to apply Facebook’s <a href="https://transparency.fb.com/policies/community-standards/">Community Standards</a> in a language other than English, leaving those workers in a situation where they’re forced to first translate that guidance before applying it.&nbsp;</p><p>And there’s the scale of the problem the team has to tackle. Genpact’s Spanish-language moderation team is named after Mexico but in addition to moderating content posted by people living in the North American country, they’re also responsible for Facebook and Instagram posts from Spanish-speaking users in most Latin American countries as well. In Mexico alone, Facebook has more than <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/in-mexico-facebook-faces-challenges-as-it-seeks-to-keep-democracy-honest/2018/06/22/098d5f3a-7624-11e8-b4b7-308400242c2e_story.html">84 million users</a>. By contrast, the Genpact Mexican market team consists of approximately 50 individuals.</p><p>“We use the combination of technology and people to keep content that breaks our rules off of our platform, and while AI has made progress in this space, people are a key part of our safety efforts,” a Meta spokesperson told Engadget. “We know these jobs can be difficult, which is why we work closely with our partners to constantly evaluate how to best support these teams.”</p><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/meta-genpact-spanish-langauge-descrimination-001938677.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">44b6b8d3-eef0-447d-8360-773547be3993</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jan 2022 00:19:38 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642162388</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T12:13:17+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69777bd0-4239-11ec-bff3-daacf01891f3" width="4900" height="3109" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/69777bd0-4239-11ec-bff3-daacf01891f3" width="4900" height="3109" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Dado Ruvic / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[A woman holds a smartphone with Meta logo on it in front of a displayed Facebook logo in this illustration taken, October 28, 2021.

The company has not yet officially announced its imminent demise, though its reactions from its workforce have already appeared on LinkedIn.</p><p>“As with most adventures, they must come to an end,” Jeff Hollowell, Local Motors VP of information technology, wrote on Thursday. “Local Motors has closed its doors. It has been an exciting, challenging, and educational experience working with Olli and all the team at Local Motors. I was fortunate to work with amazing individuals and help build what others said could not be done! I’ve been able to grow as a leader and learn new skills that I now take to my next path forward. Thanks to all the team members and partners that I was able to work with. The time spent was well worth the effort.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Local Motors pioneered the idea of crowdsourcing the production of vehicles with 2016&#39;s, Olli, a<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-16-olli-driverless-ev-local-motors-ibm-watson.html"> 3D-printed 12-passenger microbus</a> powered by now equally defunct IBM&#39;s Watson. It set off a minor arms race among automakers to produce a new class of autonomous EV people movers, however, imparting Level 4 autonomous capabilities has proven exceedingly difficult to date — in part due to technological shortcomings in the current generation of sensor and signal processing systems. Of. course, that hasn&#39;t dissuaded companies from trying, their efforts having led to a series of high-profile traffic accidents in recent years such as the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-11-09-las-vegas-self-driving-shuttle-bus-crash.html">Navya that wrecked</a> in the opening hours of CES 2017, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/toyota-epalette-tokyo-paralympic-games-collision-201745169.html">Toyota e-Pallette that ran down a paralympian</a> in August, and <a href="https://www.cp24.com/news/1-person-critically-injured-in-whitby-collision-involving-self-driving-shuttle-1.5711026">the solo-vehicle accident in Whitby, Ontario</a> that critically injured a man last December.</p><p>Local Motors first made a name for itself with the <a href="https://www.gearpatrol.com/cars/a53127/local-motors-rally-fighter/">Rally Fighter kit car</a> before it pivoted to developing the Olli. The company had planned to launch a pilot program for the second iteration of its autonomous shuttle, the Olli 2.0, in Toronto last spring, however those plans were subsequently pushed back to February, 2022, and, with Thursday&#39;s revelation, will now likely never take place.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/after-15-years-local-motors-will-reportedly-cease-operations-this-friday-224540158.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">800cc426-8994-42fd-b728-38954a86543d</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 22:45:40 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642166389</ingested><modified>2022-01-14T13:20:35+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a282a810-74bf-11ec-beff-24ab959a0ddb" width="1024" height="683" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a282a810-74bf-11ec-beff-24ab959a0ddb" width="1024" height="683" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Local Motors]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[olli autonomous shuttle]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[olli]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[US lawmakers want terms of service to be summarized in plain language]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Unless you’re a lawyer, there’s a pretty good chance you’ve never read through a website’s entire terms of service. There’s a simple reason for that. Far too often, they’re too long and difficult to parse. Some services offer summary statements, but they’re the exception, not the norm.</p><p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers made up of Representative Lori Trahan and Senators Bill Cassidy and Ben Ray Luján of Louisana and New Mexico want to change that. They’ve introduced the <a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/tldr_act.pdf"><ins>Terms-of-service Labelling, Design and Readability Act</ins></a> – that’s TLDR for short. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-privacy-label-december-8-233406513.html"><ins>Taking a page from Apple</ins></a>, the proposed legislation would require online businesses to include a “nutrition label-style” summary at the top of their terms of service agreements and make the contracts easy for researchers to examine through the use of XML tags.

The group cites a <a href="https://lorrie.cranor.org/pubs/readingPolicyCost-authorDraft.pdf"><ins>2012 study</ins></a> that found it would take the average American 76 workdays to read all the terms of service contracts they’ve agreed to use their favorite online services as the basis for the need of the TLDR Act.

Reuters photographer Leah Millis: "Thousands of supporters of then-President Donald Trump, a Republican, stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 in a failed attempt to overturn the recent election and prevent Joe Biden, a Democrat, from becoming the next president. It was the worst attack on the seat of the U.S. government since the War of 1812. I arrived at the west side of the U.S. Capitol before the Trump supporters overwhelmed police lines, and I documented the chaos that ensued for the next seven hours. At one point I heard the crowd chanting "heave-ho" and thought they must be breaking in through the doors. I didn't want to risk getting crushed or injured by the massive crowd, which was hostile toward members of the media and had already assaulted several of my colleagues that day. I chose to risk climbing some scaffolding that had been erected for the upcoming inauguration to give me a better view. The Capitol had already been breached via different entrances, but the fight for this entrance went on for hours. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the mob of Trump supporters and in the process multiple officers were severely injured. Four people would die that day and a police officer attacked by protesters died the next day. Four officers later took their own lives. Eventually, law enforcement was able to successfully push the crowd back. At 5:04 p.m. to disperse the remaining protesters, they used a flash-bang grenade, which released a blinding light that illuminated the U.S. Capitol building. To me, the explosion of the grenade captured the violence and shock of the day: American citizens attacking and breaching their own country's Capitol building.

A DC federal grand jury has <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/leader-oath-keepers-and-10-other-individuals-indicted-federal-court-seditious-conspiracy-and">unsealed</a> seditious conspiracy charges against Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes and 10 other individuals for their alleged roles in the US Capitol breach on January 6th, 2021.  Rhodes and followers face accusations they planned to use force to oppose the electoral college vote certification, including the direct attempt to seize the Capitol building as well as through multiple &quot;quick reaction force&quot; teams that planned to deliver guns and other weapons to extremists inside the building.</p><p>The Oath Keepers&#39; digital savviness played an important role in the charges. The paramilitary group discussed plans with co-conspirators through encrypted messaging apps, social media, text messaging and websites, according to the Justice Department. Federal investigators <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/13/feds-say-they-used-encrypted-messages-to-charge-oath-keepers-leader.html">revealed</a> they&#39;d used Signal messages as part of the case, although it wasn&#39;t clear how they&#39;d obtained the discussions — <em>CNBC</em> speculated that a participant in group chats leaked the contents to federal agents.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Rhodes and Edward Vallejo, who reportedly helped coordinate the quick reaction teams, are the only ones facing charges for the first time. The rest, including prominent members like Donovan Crowl and Jessica Watkins, were already facing indictments. The conspiracy charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.</p><p>The legal action could effectively bring down a group long accused of promoting harm both on- and offline. The Oath Keepers had threatened violence online, prompting a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-the-oath-keepers-211426663.html">Twitter ban</a> in September 2020, and spread COVID-19 conspiracy theories that sometimes included <a href="https://www.engadget.com/social-media-and-coronavirus-turned-qanon-mainstream-192049364.html">QAnon</a>-linked hashtags. The group&#39;s Capitol incursion, meanwhile, was partly fuelled by online <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-stop-the-steal-policies-report-205339822.html">election misinformation</a> promoting unsupported claims of widespread fraud during the 2020 presidential vote.</p><p>The Oath Keepers already lost much of their online presence in the months before and after the Capitol incident, but the new charges could make it that much harder for the group or its members to maintain that internet representation. This also underscores social media outlets&#39; imperfect attempts to curb violent organizations and the misinformation that fuels them. While more aggressive crackdowns wouldn&#39;t have necessarily stopped the 2021 breach, outlets like Facebook have acknowledged they could have done more to curb groups that spread and acted on that misinformation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/oath-keepers-leader-charged-capitol-breach-211007516.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a88ebdfe-d93c-4446-b678-507afd26bff5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 21:10:07 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642108208</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T21:10:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/18a831d0-74a3-11ec-bf4f-d938bc0fd0a8" width="2200" height="1466" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/18a831d0-74a3-11ec-bf4f-d938bc0fd0a8" width="2200" height="1466" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Jim Urquhart / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Oath Keepers founder, Stewart Rhodes, speaks during the Patriots Day Free Speech Rally in Berkeley, California, U.S. April 15, 2017.

Sadly, that’s precisely what one New Mexico school district employee did. Kristy Stock was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison for her role in a scheme to steal and resell more than 3,000 iPods intended for Native American students.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-md/pr/former-new-mexico-school-district-employee-sentenced-18-months-federal-prison-stealing"><ins>release issued by the Department of Justice</ins></a> details the charges against Stock of tax fraud and transportation of stolen goods. According to her plea agreement and court documents, the scheme began back in 2013 when she was in charge of a program for the Central Consolidated School District of New Mexico designed to provide devices to Native American students living on tribal reservations.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While overseeing the program, Stock was supposed to use federal grant money to buy iPods to distribute to students. However, thanks to help from other conspirators including her friend James Bender and Saurabh Chawla, the group ended up shipping the stolen iPods to Maryland where they were listed on eBay before being sold at a “substantial” markup.</p><p>Due to his own account having previously been suspended due to security concerns, Chawla was forced to use Bender’s eBay account to list the stolen devices for auction, with Bender serving as an intermediary. Later, between 2015 and 2018, Stock communicated directly with Chawla, providing info on the make, model, color and quantity of devices before agreeing on a price and putting them up for auction.</p><p>All told, Stock admitted that she made more than $800,000 from selling stolen iPods between 2013 and 2018. To make matters worse, Stock also filed fraudulent tax returns on the income, resulting in tax loss of around $270,000. That said, while Stock faces an 18-month prison sentence, she actually got off lighter than her co-conspirator Chawla, who was sentenced to 66 months after failing to pay more than $700,000 in taxes. Meanwhile, Bender was sentenced to just 366 days in prison.</p><p>So while Stock and her crew eventually got caught, the real lesson is that here is that crime doesn’t pay–especially if you’re stealing from children and then lying on your taxes about your ill-gotten income.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/woman-sentenced-to-prison-for-stealing-over-3000-ipods-intended-for-native-american-students-194009681.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8fa92df1-f821-4e26-a1d7-0e472e126438</guid><dc:creator>Sam Rutherford</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 19:40:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642101507</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T19:19:15+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Crime & Justice]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Sam Rutherford]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/645cb010-74a3-11ec-97ed-caf007601916" width="5000" height="3750" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/a4e62440-74a3-11ec-bf57-613d22b5d24c" width="2560" height="1440" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Gado via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Close-up of an Apple iPod Nano 7th generation music player, produced ca 2012, on a light gray surface in Lafayette, California, December 25, 2021.

Given that owners of the previous two games can access locations from those titles, you&#39;ll be able to play the entire trilogy in VR. The virtual reality mode has been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitman-3-vr-trailer-psvr-202918052.html"><ins>available on PSVR</ins></a> since last January.</p><div id="dbb1f517c8dc4874bfb2bf2cbc21d2b0"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/WxkfE8fO2A">pic.twitter.com/WxkfE8fO2A</a></p>— Eskil Møhl (@Eskil_IOI) <a href="https://twitter.com/Eskil_IOI/status/1471817268824838145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>IO has also laid out some of its content plans for Year Two of <em>Hitman 3.</em> In Elusive Target Arcade, each contract will challenge players to take down multiple Elusive Targets in a certain order, with some complications added for good measure.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike standard Elusive Targets, which you <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hitman-3-first-elusive-target-mission-211311444.html">only get one shot at</a>, Arcade contracts are permanent additions to the game. The twist is that, if you fail a contract, you need to wait 12 hours before you can try again. IO says this will help Arcade contracts retain the high-stakes spirit of Elusive Targets. Three Arcade Contracts will be added on January 20th, with more to follow later in the year.</p><p>Another new mode called Freelancer is coming to <em>Hitman 3</em> this spring. It includes a customizable safehouse where you can plan out missions. That&#39;s important, because the mode has roguelike elements. If you take gear out on a mission and don&#39;t return with it, that equipment will vanish from your inventory. However, you&#39;ll be able to acquire weapons and items from Suppliers that you find in mission locations.</p><p>Later this year, IO will add a ray-tracing mode to the PC version of <em>Hitman 3</em>, which will work with locations from the other games.

There hasn&#39;t been a brand-new game in the series since <em>The Settlers Online</em> in 2010, and the decade since has only led to a cancelled game (<em>Kingdoms of Anteria</em>) and four years of development for the imminent reboot. While there will certainly still be fans, it&#39;s not clear how many of them were willing to wait a decade for a follow-up.</p><div id="28c4c0948b7c4512a95a3123f806fe45"><div style="left:0;width:100%;height:0;position:relative;padding-bottom:56.25%;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m-kVr2X306A?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/the-settlers-reboot-release-date-171935887.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">40be4d1f-2fcf-4816-ab2e-45ffc5216db5</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 17:19:35 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642093841</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T17:10:48+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Video Games]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1ef20bc0-748e-11ec-bb77-08f72d2665d4" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-01/1ef20bc0-748e-11ec-bb77-08f72d2665d4" width="1920" height="1280" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Ubisoft]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA['The Settlers' reboot from Ubisoft]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA['The Settlers' reboot from Ubisoft]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Apple's third-gen AirPods drop to $140 at Amazon]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you missed the holiday-season discounts on Apple&#39;s latest AirPods last year, you have another opportunity to get them today. Amazon has the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:third-generation AirPods" href="https://amzn.to/3K8Vuun">third-generation AirPods</a> for $140 right now, which is 22 percent off and a return to their record-low price. Apple released these buds last fall and they represent a complete redesign from the original AirPods, which resembled Apple&#39;s old-school EarPods.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3K8Vuun" id="659afe8ae4fd442ea8fdbeaedd32398a" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy AirPods (3rd gen) at Amazon - $140</a><p>While the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:second-generation AirPods" href="https://amzn.to/3HWMNBo">second-generation AirPods</a> haven&#39;t been retired yet, the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-review-2021-160026883.html">latest models</a> will likely work better for most people. That&#39;s due in part to their new design, which looks more like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:AirPods Pro" href="https://amzn.to/3GCMT0E">AirPods Pro</a>. They don&#39;t have the removable silicone ear tips that the Pros have, but they have a contoured look with a shorter stem plus an IPX4 rating that should protect them during  sweaty workouts.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Apple also greatly improved the audio on these AirPods; their custom driver and high-dynamic-range amplifier help produce crisp sounds with rich bass. While they don&#39;t support ANC, the third-gen earbuds do have Adaptive EQ, spatial audio and always-on Siri. The H1 chip inside helps enable all of those features, along with fast pairing and switching between Apple devices. We also appreciate their battery life — you should get six hours of listening time before they need more juice, and roughly 30 total hours of use with the extra power provided by their charging case.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-third-generation-airpods-drop-to-140-at-amazon-170410502.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">12645cdf-8b93-4d95-89f2-e45d1a082cf4</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 17:04:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1642092993</ingested><modified>2022-01-13T16:56:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/72e88700-359a-11ec-bfb9-b69664469f60" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-10/72e88700-359a-11ec-bfb9-b69664469f60" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Apple totally overhauled AirPods for the third-generation version with the biggest changes coming in the design and audio quality.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Apple AirPods (2021) review]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Bandai Namco is making a 'My Hero Academia' battle royale for PS4, Xbox One and Switch]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As if the market for battle royale games wasn’t crowded enough already, you’ll soon have another option in the form of <em>My Hero Academia: Ultra Rumble. </em>Based on the popular manga and anime, Bandai Namco teased the title in a <em>Weekly Shōnen Jump</em> article spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2022/01/free-to-play-battle-royale-my-hero-academia-ultra-rumble-announced-for-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc"><em><ins>Gematsu</ins></em></a>.</p><div id="a58b2d807adb4099aabe4a6132e79b5d"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The latest issue of Weekly Jump reveals.
