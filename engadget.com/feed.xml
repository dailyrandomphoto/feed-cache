The Denis Villeneuve adaptation of the Frank Herbert novel is <a href="https://www.imax.com/news/dune-is-returning-to-imax-theatres-on-december-3">returning</a> to IMAX theaters on December 3rd for a limited time only.

The Airborne Object Identification and Management Synchronization Group (AOIMSG) will succeed the US Navy’s Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force.

For every other incident detailed in that report, ODNI said there was too little data for it to conclude what happened. If the US government were to have any chance at better understanding UFOs, ODNI said it would need to deploy more resources and a standardized approach across various agencies.

If there’s a theme to the sale, it’s all about CRPGs. Expect to see titles like <a href="https://adtr.co/DtnE4a"><em><ins>Divinity: Original Sin</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://adtr.co/r25kVJ"><em><ins>Divinity 2</ins></em></a> as much as 65 percent off.</p><p>One of the highlights of the sale sees <a href="https://adtr.co/xvym2C"><em><ins>Horizon Zero Dawn</ins></em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>discounted by 50 percent to $23.74. The Complete Edition includes the excellent <em>Frozen Wilds </em>DLC that expands the story and adds an entirely new open-world area for players to explore. If you’ve been waiting to pick up <em>Horizon</em> on PC, now is a good time to do so since Guerrilla patched many of the performance issues that hampered the game at launch. We’ll note here <em>Horizon</em> is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/"><ins>50 percent off on Steam</ins></a> if you would rather buy the game through Valve’s storefront.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>You can also get 50 percent off on both <a href="https://adtr.co/fPLcZe"><em><ins>Disco Elysium</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://adtr.co/7NbQ75"><em><ins>Cyberpunk 2077</ins></em></a>. If we had to pick a favorite among that pair, it would be <em>Disco Elysium</em>. It’s one of the best RPGs to come out in recent memory and has a lot to say about a variety of topics. If the fact it involved a lot of reading made you hesitant to try it before, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/disco-elysium-console-final-cut-2021-015155766.html"><ins>The Final Cut</ins></a> release adds full voice acting to the game. At just under $32, we’d say even <em>Cyberpunk</em> is worth it.</p><p>GOG has also discounted the entire Focus Home Interactive catalog by up to 80 percent. In that way, you can get some less-known gems like <a href="https://adtr.co/SltpQc"><em><ins>A Plague Tale: Innocence</ins></em></a> and <a href="https://adtr.co/8pUqM7"><em><ins>Vampyr</ins></em></a> for as low as $9.89. They’re not the most polished games, but if you’re looking for something different and with some character, they’re worth checking out.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/gog-pre-black-friday-sale-183145902.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">bf8ba10c-4373-461f-a26f-ee5a0db6ed10</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:31:45 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637778710</ingested><modified>2021-11-24T18:32:03+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-01/7c788490-389f-11ea-b7ff-dcf6bc93b438" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-01/7c788490-389f-11ea-b7ff-dcf6bc93b438" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Sony]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Horizon Zero Dawn]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Horizon Zero Dawn]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA['Star Trek: Discovery' season 4 will stream on Pluto TV in some countries]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&#39;t panic that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-leaves-netflix-080929478.html"><em>Star Trek: Discovery</em> vanished from Netflix</a> in many countries right before <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-discovery-november-18-paramount-plus-014439729.html">season 4</a> arrived — you might have a stopgap solution, depending on where you live.

The Commerce Department has added eight technology producers to its Entity List to prevent them from supporting the Chinese military&#39;s quantum computing efforts. Officials are concerned the entities could feed &quot;emerging&quot; US tech that could aid with <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2014-01-03-nsa-wants-to-make-a-quantum-computer.html">breaking encryption</a>, producing <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-10-09-researchers-demo-unbreakable-encryption-based-on-quantum-crypt.html">&#39;unbreakable&#39; encryption</a> and developing anti-stealth or anti-submarine systems.</p><p><a href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2021-25808.pdf">The list</a> focuses on a mix of companies and researchers, including QuantumCTek and the Hefei National Laboratory for Physical Sciences at Microscale. The US also added three affiliates of Corad Technology Limited, a Chinese firm on the list since 2019, although it wasn&#39;t clear that quantum computing was involved — it was also accused of backing Iran&#39;s military and space programs as well as North Korea &quot;front companies.&quot;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The broader Entity List update included 27 organizations and people, including 13 in Pakistan accused of backing the country&#39;s &quot;unsafeguarded&quot; nuclear or ballistic missile programs.</p><p>This is unlikely to put a stop to China&#39;s military uses of quantum computing when the country may need to research and develop much of the technology in-house. The expanded blocklist might slow things down, however, by limiting China&#39;s access to American processors and other equipment that could fast-track development.

If you have any remaining quests you want to complete, now might be the time to do that.</p><p>Squads of up to 16 players will be able to experience The End together. The event playlist will open at 3:30PM, so it&#39;s probably worth joining early to secure a spot. Meanwhile, since Epic is ending the season a day earlier than planned, everyone who logs into <em>Fortnite</em> before it wraps up will receive a 225,000 XP bonus.

You&#39;ll get both email and iMessage notifications to the addresses and phone numbers associated with your Apple ID. If you visit <a href="https://appleid.apple.com/">appleid.apple.com</a>, you&#39;ll also see a prominent &quot;threat notification&quot; message indicating what happened and when.</p><p>The company stressed these notifications will never ask you to click links, download content or share login details like passwords and verification codes. It instead asked users to visit the Apple ID website to verify warnings.

Samsung&#39;s original Galaxy Chromebook was one of them, but the company realized that paying $1,000 for a Chrome OS machine was a hard sell for most. Enter the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Galaxy Chromebook 2" href="https://amzn.to/3HTbRKg">Galaxy Chromebook 2</a>, Samsung&#39;s correction and a much better laptop with an easier-to-stomach starting price of $449. But now you can get the Galaxy Chromebook 2 for $50 less, or $399, which is a record low. That&#39;s for the base model with a Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Core i3 model" href="https://amzn.to/3FB0XXQ">Core i3 model</a> is also on sale for $549 — $50 more than it&#39;s lowest price, but still a decent deal.</p><a class="athena-button" href="https://amzn.to/3HTbRKg" id="cb6635a09c8249f7a2d9a7fa13c0f8a8" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Chromebook 2 at Amazon - $399</a><a class="athena-button" href="https://fave.co/3oLrnzb" id="6f88c187621a4fd08c2349b0997a70a6" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Samsung;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:">Buy Galaxy Chromebook 2 at Samsung - $399</a><p>Samsung prioritized the right things when developing the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review-140021243.html">Galaxy Chromebook 2</a>. The design is much the same as the original, with a relatively light 2.2-pound frame, a premium build and a fiery red color. The company ditched the lovely yet taxing 4K display from the previous version and opted for a 1080p QLED touchscreen which remains nicer than panels on most other Chromebooks. While the 4K display did a number on the original laptop&#39;s battery life, this QLED display isn&#39;t as bad. We managed to get about 12 hours of use on a single charge, and while we wish the battery life was a tad longer, it should get you through a work day.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The Galaxy Chromebook 2 has a convertible design, too, so you can use it in tablet mode or prop it up so it acts as a small TV for video streaming. It doesn&#39;t come with a stylus like some of Samsung&#39;s other laptops, but any <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-02-01-google-universal-stylus-initiative.html">Universal Stylus Initiative</a> pen will work with it. If you&#39;re eyeing the Galaxy Chromebook 2 as a secondary or travel device, the base model with a Celeron processor may provide all the power you need. But hardcore Chrome OS fans who want to use this machine as their daily driver won&#39;t regret shelling out a bit more money for the Core i3 version.</p><p><em>Get the latest Black Friday and Cyber Monday offers by visiting </em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/buyers-guide/deals/"><em>our deals homepage</em></a><em> and following </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals on Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>All products recommended by Engadget are selected by our editorial team, independent of our parent company.

Due to a technical issue with the campaign, the Elecjet Apollo Ultra was pulled from Indiegogo, but has returned today. The article text remains as originally published, but links to the campaign have changed.</em></p><p>In the space of a few years, we’ve gone from 5W USB adapters being the norm, to iPads and Nintendo Switches being able to charge at 18W, all the way up to modern laptops drawing up to 140W. This explosion in charging rates over a (somewhat) standardized USB-C connector has been great for consumers who can now mostly charge their stuff with one or two well-positioned adapters. But, it’s made choosing the right power bank to keep all of your devices topped up on the go way more difficult.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Enter Elecjet, a small company which has been carving out a niche for itself by using graphene in adapters and power banks. It launched its first “graphene-enhanced battery power bank,” on Indiegogo back in 2019, and is now back with the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/elecjet-world-s-fastest-charging-power-bank--2?secret_perk_token=426e4ca2&amp;utm_source=prm&amp;utm_medium=engadget&amp;utm_campaign=elecjet#">Elecjet Apollo Ultra</a>. It’s a 37Wh (10,000mAh) power bank with a couple of notable specs: It can be charged at 100W, and can output at up to 87W across its two ports.</p><p>These numbers are very high. On the output side, most 10,000mAh battery packs top out at around 18W; it’s only chunkier chargers that reach figures like 65W. On the input side of things, you’re looking at around 30W as the peak for a high-end portable charger. (There is a market for “laptop power stations,” which can meet and in some cases best Elecjet’s input and output numbers, but those are typically bulky units.)</p><p>My personal power bank at the moment is a 20,000mAh Anker PowerCore, which maxes out at around 25W output and 30W input. Although it’s double the capacity of the graphene model, after about a month of using a pre-production unit Elecjet sent me, I don’t want to go back.</p><div id="aaac938bf3f84bad835f9256cceb6ce6"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MlJwM_hjwvk?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p>Before I get into that, what does a “graphene-enhanced battery” even mean? Elecjet takes the lithium cells that are inside every device nowadays, and plays with the chemistry. Its “composite graphene cells,” mix a graphene solution in with the lithium in the cathode, and then add some layers of graphene coating the anode.</p><p>What you get from this sprinkling of graphene is much improved performance at the expense of size. Thanks to offering lower resistance and higher thermal conductivity, Elecjet’s graphene-lithium composite cells can theoretically be charged five times faster, and run through five times more charge cycles, but are about 25 percent less energy dense than regular lithium. So, composite graphene batteries are faster and run cooler, but will either have a lower capacity or a larger size when compared to the batteries we’re used to.</p><p>I’m not really close to pushing the Apollo Ultra to its stated 87W limit. The devices I need to charge on the regular are an iPhone 12, a Nintendo Switch and an M1 MacBook Air. It happily charges my Nintendo Switch at 18W, my iPhone at 20W, and my MacBook Air at around 45W.</p><p>That last figure is actually higher than the charger that came with the MacBook Air, but on plugging in a 65W Apple charger from a MacBook Pro, I saw essentially the same figure, so it appears that’s a safe rate for the battery. I did run some tests on a friend’s 13-inch MacBook Pro, though, and found it was able to charge it at a similar speed to the 65W charger that device came with, so I have no reason to doubt the output claims.</p><p>Speaking of claims, this is nitpicking to the extreme, but the Apollo Ultra’s USB-C port outputs at up to 65W, and its USB-A port can handle 18W. With the PPS power spec it can output at 68.25W, but none of these combinations add up to the claimed 87W output figure.</p><p>Output aside, the main benefit for me is how fast you can charge the battery itself. I’m quite forgetful, and will often be getting ready to leave the house with my phone on low battery, and then go to pick up my power bank only to find out it’s empty. I’m sure that’ll still happen, because if I haven’t learned in 36 years to prepare for life adequately I’m not about to change now.&nbsp;</p><p>But being able to charge the Apollo Ultra so quickly has meant it’s really not an issue. Plugging it in for about six to seven minutes gives me enough juice to charge my iPhone from the red up to 100 percent, and honestly even a couple of minutes before I run out of the door has got me home without my phone dying on me. Although the pre-production units are limited to 87W input (and so took about 35 minutes to charge), the final, 100W edition will charge from 0 to full in under half an hour. It’s like a safety net for my own stupidity.</p><p>Its small size, at least in comparison to my regular power bank, is also a plus. At 130 x 68mm, Elecjet’s bank has roughly the same footprint as an iPhone 13 mini, and it’s about 17mm thick. It’s totally pocketable for most folks, or at the least jacket-pocketable, which is not something I can say about my Anker. It’s also, in my opinion, pretty attractive for a power bank, with nice quality white and black plastics, and a proper display that shows the battery percentage. After years of divining how much power is left with four little LEDs, having so many degrees of precision is very nice.</p><p>For everything I love about its size and build quality, there’s no getting around the fact that the Apollo Ultra’s overall capacity is quite low. It can handle about two thirds of a MacBook Air’s charge, two and a bit Switch charges, or three-ish charges of a modern smartphone. That’s… absolutely fine. But the benefits of being able to charge something at 65W are somewhat limited when the battery drains in 35 minutes at that rate.</p><p>What I really want is impossible with today’s tech: Something this size, just as performant, but double the capacity. In the future, Elecjet says it will be able to make the power module smaller to mitigate the density issue, and it also claims it has “ a new battery under the wraps” that can get far closer to the density of regular cells.</p><p>In the meantime, it would be great to see Elecjet expand its current Apollo Ultra range to include larger capacity batteries. Some options would be good, so buyers can pick the compromise that suits them. A 55Wh battery pack would only be 50 percent larger, but handle a wider variety of devices. Even a 75Wh battery would only be double the volume.</p><section data-eng-breakout="99b534d608dc42458c4d82a174332a0b" data-eng-breakout-type="e2ehero"><img class="e2ehero-url" src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/00f012f0-439e-11ec-9eef-2c5208c040e1" alt="Elecjet Apollo Ultra"></section><p>Judging the pricing Elecjet has opted for is difficult. <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/elecjet-world-s-fastest-charging-power-bank--2?secret_perk_token=426e4ca2&amp;utm_source=prm&amp;utm_medium=engadget&amp;utm_campaign=elecjet#">The Apollo Ultra is on Indiegogo at $65</a>, which is honestly the most expensive I’ve seen a battery pack of this capacity in recent memory. But it behaves more like the ultra-high end battery packs that go for $100+, and unlike those it fits in my jeans pocket. But it doesn’t last as long as those— you see my problem. I think $65 is a reasonable price for what you get here. It’s a sleek, cool-looking thing, and the fast-charging makes it more useful to me than a “regular” larger-capacity battery pack.</p><p>As with all Indiegogo products, there’s a big caveat in that you are not buying a product that currently exists. Production will begin shortly, and users backing today should expect their devices in early 2022. I have a working unit on my desk, so I’m confident that Elecjet can deliver a power bank as advertised. But the company’s past Indiegogo campaigns do lead to even more caveats.</p><p>Both the Elecjet Apollo and Apollo Max campaigns had issues. A few users reported exploding power banks, others never received their units and, perhaps worst of all, users who complained through the Indiegogo campaigns were left without answers for months or in a couple of cases years. All of the complaints have now been addressed, but only in the past few days leading up to the launch of the new product.</p><p>Elecjet merged with another company named Real Graphene earlier this year. Both companies were founded by the same person, Samuel Gong, a UC Berkeley engineering graduate, but Gong says he was not involved in the day-to-day operations of Elecjet until the two merged.&nbsp;</p><p>When I asked about the complaints surrounding prior campaigns, Gong acknowledged that “there were some issues with the previous products’ quality,” and said most people who didn’t receive their product failed to provide a shipping address through Indiegogo. He said the company “was being managed by another team, and previous campaigns and products were done by [that] team.” He added that the new Apollo Ultra was extensively prototyped and has been evaluated by UL (a well-regarded certification company) for safety. The press pack Elecjet provided touts “8 safety features” and notes the device never exceeded 42C in testing. This matches my personal experience, in which the device was cooler to the touch than my regular power bank, which was charging at a lower rate.</p><p>As for not responding to customer support requests, he acknowledged that, after the merger, the company “couldn’t dedicate enough time to previous campaigns.” The reason he gave for the sudden responses to old complaints was that a new team has been hired to manage the Indiegogo campaign, and that team is also aiding backers of old projects from before the new leadership team was around.</p><p>I’m extremely into the Elecjet Apollo Ultra. It’s rare that I’m interested, let alone excited, about a product as dull as a power bank, but it’s always good to see something totally new enter any tech space. Those caveats are certainly worrying, though. If you’re not willing to take the risk but are still interested, Elecjet does have its own retail site, and <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:a sizable Amazon presence" href="https://amzn.to/3C9YDor">a sizable Amazon presence</a>, for its other products.

That means they support Apple&#39;s Spatial Audio feature and let you easily switch between Apple devices — just as you can with a pair of AirPods. However, they&#39;re also device agnostic, so you can use the Fast Pair option to quickly set them up with your Android device. They also work with Find My Device on Android, so you can see their last known location.&nbsp;</p><p>The main drawbacks are a lack of wireless charging and onboard controls, but most budget wireless buds lack those features.

According to the new agreement, however, Tesla will now be able to associate video to specific vehicles. &quot;By enabling FSD Beta, I consent to Tesla’s collection of VIN-associated image data from the vehicle’s external cameras and Cabin Camera in the occurrence of a serious safety risk or a safety event like a collision,&quot; the agreement reads.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><blockquote><p>By enabling FSD Beta, I consent to Tesla’s collection of VIN-associated image data from the vehicle’s external cameras and Cabin Camera in the occurrence of a serious safety risk or a safety event like a collision.</p></blockquote><p>As <em>Electrek</em> notes, the language could indicate that Tesla wants to ensure it has evidence in case its FSD system is blamed for an accident. It could possibly also be used to detect and fix serious issues more quickly.</p><p>FSD 10.3 was released more widely than previous betas, but it was <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-pulls-latest-self-driving-beta-over-left-turn-and-other-issues-063331006.html">quickly pulled back</a> due to issues like unwarranted Forward Collision Warnings, unexpected autobraking and more.  At the time, CEO Elon Musk tweeted that such issues are &quot;to be expected with beta software,&quot; adding that &quot;it is impossible to test all hardware configs in all conditions with internal QA, hence public tests.&quot;</p><p>However, other drivers on public roads are unwitting beta testers, too. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-investigation-192733573.html">currently investigating</a> a driver&#39;s complaint that FSD led to a November 3rd collision in Brea, California. The owner alleged that it caused his Model Y to enter the wrong lane and hit another car, causing considerable damage to both.&nbsp;</p><p>Tesla is releasing the new beta to even more users with Driver Safety Scores of 98 and up — previously, beta releases were limited to drivers with perfect 100 scores. Tesla charges drivers $199 per month for the feature or $10,000 in one shot, but has failed meet promised deadlines for autonomous driving. Currently, the FSD system is considered to be a Level 2 system — far from the Level 4 required to really be &quot;full self-driving.&quot;&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-fsd-testers-must-consent-to-video-collection-in-case-of-a-crash-or-safety-issue-092112078.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b4acb0fb-3e3f-4c81-bb01-7e0acb7dec44</guid><dc:creator>Steve Dent</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 09:21:12 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637767822</ingested><modified>2021-11-24T15:30:32+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Automotive Industry]]></category><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Steve Dent]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64b9ce00-4d00-11ec-bedf-8246fed3f253" width="2270" height="1329" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-11/64b9ce00-4d00-11ec-bedf-8246fed3f253" width="2270" height="1329" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Tesla FSD agree to video collection]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Tesla FSD agree to video collection]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Samsung will build a $17 billion semiconductor factory in Texas]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Samsung has committed to build a chip-making factory in Texas, just as the US starts to push for the expansion in semiconductor production within the country. The Korean tech giant will be investing $17 billion into the new facility, which will manufacture high-end and advanced chips for smartphones, 5G and artificial intelligence, among other applications. According to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-picks-texas-for-17-billion-chip-making-factory-11637710466?mod=rss_Technology"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a>, construction for the factory is scheduled to begin next year, while production within the facility is expected to start in the second half of 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>The US government has been taking steps towards <a href="https://www.engadget.com/biden-budget-proposal-domestic-chip-manufacturing-180310697.html">boosting</a> semiconductor production in the US, following the global chip shortage caused by shuttered plants and the high demand for PCs and other devices during the pandemic.

It ultimately chose Taylor, Texas for this new facility due to the generous tax breaks and incentives it offered, as well as the city&#39;s capability to do rolling blackouts and providing electricity to certain facilities in the case of power outage.&nbsp;</p><p>Kim Ki-nam, chief executive of the Samsung Electronics Device Solutions Division, said in a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/23/samsung-announces-new-advanced-semiconductor-fabrication-site-in-taylor-texas/">statement</a>:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;As we add a new facility in Taylor, Samsung is laying the groundwork for another important chapter in our future. With greater manufacturing capacity, we will able to better serve the needs of our customers and contribute to the stability of the global semiconductor supply chain. We are also proud to be bringing more jobs and supporting the training and talent development for local communities, as Samsung celebrates 25 years of semiconductor manufacturing in the US.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/samsung-17-billion-chip-factory-texas-054150875.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">0530a209-77b6-4d12-8baa-dd50b1152bb9</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 24 Nov 2021 05:41:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637733134</ingested><modified>2021-11-24T05:52:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Sectors & Industries]]></category><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2018-11/9d39ea50-f3ec-11e8-a5bf-da5d7be62959" width="5661" height="4152" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2018-11/9d39ea50-f3ec-11e8-a5bf-da5d7be62959" width="5661" height="4152" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[georgeclerk via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Seoul, Republic of Korea - March 26, 2013: The Samsung logo on the window of one of the South Korean company's offices in Gangnam, central Seoul, with cars and people on the street reflected  in the window.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Samsung Office in Seoul]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon delays Comixology integration to early 2022]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon has delayed its plan to integrate Comixology purchases and the platform itself into its broader ecosystem.

The FCC said the carrier responded to outage-related questions in a &quot;timely&quot; fashion, however, so this wasn&#39;t a hotly disputed issue. Not that the company was likely to fight a settlement that won&#39;t significantly impact its finances. And like it or not, this won&#39;t do much to help people who couldn&#39;t get full help in a moment of crisis.</p><p><strong>Update 11/24 12:45PM ET:</strong> T-Mobile told Engadget it takes reliable connectivity and public safety &quot;very seriously&quot; with multiple failsafes, and that it was &quot;moving on&quot; from the FCC investigation to focus on its network expansion. You can read the full statement below.</p><blockquote><p>We understand how critical reliable connectivity is to ensure public safety and we take that responsibility very seriously. We have built resiliency into our emergency systems to ensure that our 911 elements are available when they’re needed.&nbsp;This was a short-term isolated outage and we immediately took&nbsp;steps&nbsp;to further enhance our network&nbsp;to prevent this type of event from happening in the future. Now we are moving on from the FCC’s investigation and continuing our focus on our ongoing network build.</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/t-mobile-911-outage-fcc-settlement-230802122.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">5d44e36d-89c5-4164-976b-dbe4a0306aeb</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Tue, 23 Nov 2021 23:08:02 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1637775902</ingested><modified>2021-11-24T17:45:13+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6b11cbd0-1700-11ec-94fb-ebcea6d7e402" width="4234" height="2823" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-09/6b11cbd0-1700-11ec-94fb-ebcea6d7e402" width="4234" height="2823" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[ARLINGTON, VA - AUGUST 18:  People walk past the front of a T-Mobile retail store on August 18, 2021 in Arlington, Virginia.
