A new analysis of the security expenses racked up by Silicon Valley giants shows they collectively spent $46 million to safeguard their top brass last year. Of that figure, $23.4 million alone was spent on Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s personal security, up from $20.4 million in 2019, according to the report by <a href="https://www.protocol.com/ceo-security-pandemic"><em>Protocol</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The company attributed the increase to new COVID-19 protocols and additional protection during the election. Included in the figure was a pre-tax allowance of $10 million and an additional $13.4 million for the Facebook founder&#39;s personal security. As a result, Zuckerberg far eclipsed others on the list including the world&#39;s richest person, Jeff Bezos, who paid $1.6 million in personal security costs. Signalling just how cautious Facebook is, the company&#39;s COO <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/SherylSandberg">Sheryl Sandberg</a> was in second place with security worth $7.6 million in 2020.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The results reflect the growing stature of the tech elite, who have grown more recognizable alongside the ballooning market caps of their companies, which provide globally popular services. Fame has inevitably brought with it unwarranted attention.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook, which has been accused of everything from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-resisted-efforts-to-be-less-divisive-report-203314601.html">polarizing</a> public discourse to enabling the spread of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">vaccine misinformation</a>, has a right to be defensive. The company has previously noted in SEC filings that Zuckerberg is &quot;synonymous&quot; with the &quot;negative sentiment&quot; around it. In April, Facebook noted that its yearly assessments “identified specific threats to Mr. Zuckerberg.&quot; Other tech leaders have also borne the brunt of their notoriety. In 2020, it was revealed that Bezos&#39; phone had been <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-21-guardian-jeff-bezos-whatsapp-hack-saudi-arabia-mbs.html">hacked</a> via WhatsApp two years prior, potentially by Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p><p>The security expenses list includes 11 individuals in total. In third place is Google&#39;s Sundar Pichai ($5.4 million in protection costs), followed by Lyft co-founder and president John Zimmer ($2.06 million), Oracle&#39;s Larry Ellison ($1.71 million), Snap&#39;s Evan Spiegel ($1.67 million), Bezos, Salesforce boss Marc Benioff ($1.31 million), Uber&#39;s Dara Khosrowshahi ($849,000), Lyft CEO Logan Green ($599,000) and Apple&#39;s Tim Cook ($470,000).</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-protect-mark-zuckerberg-130242571.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">1201b9f0-98b1-44f6-bab0-6c6c3d94368e</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 13:02:42 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626958964</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T13:02:58+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f5b58420-eaeb-11eb-bb2f-1723f3b29589" width="3500" height="2233" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/f5b58420-eaeb-11eb-bb2f-1723f3b29589" width="3500" height="2233" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Eduardo Munoz / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Facebook Inc.

If you somehow haven&#39;t invested in either yet, you could do so now for less. Amazon has a new sale on the six-quart <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Instant Pot Duo Crisp" href="https://amzn.to/3zphJGd">Instant Pot Duo Crisp</a> multi-cooker and air fryer that knocks the price down to $98, which is more than $50 off its normal price. While we saw this model drop to $79 during Black Friday last year, this discount is the best we&#39;ve seen offered by Amazon all year.</p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Instant Pot Duo Crisp at Amazon - $98" href="https://amzn.to/3zphJGd">Buy Instant Pot Duo Crisp at Amazon - $98</a></p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Unlike standard Instant Pots, this model comes with both the easy-seal lid and a detachable air-frying lid, the latter of which can be used to make crispy chicken wings, vegetables, fries and more. The pot itself has 11 built-in cooking programs, including sauté, pressure cook, steam, bake, broil and dehydrate. The bundle includes most things you&#39;ll need to try out all of those cooking modes, too, like a broil and dehydrate tray, multi-level air fry rack and more. Only the six-quart model is on sale (the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:eight-quart" href="https://amzn.to/3BxqkbA">eight-quart</a> will set you back $200), but it&#39;s arguably the best size for most people as it can hold enough food for up to eight people.</p><p>The Duo Crisp is, admittedly, a more &quot;advanced&quot; Instant Pot than most. If you&#39;re new to the multi-cooker space, we recommend the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:$69 Instant Pot Duo" href="https://amzn.to/2V785sP">$69 Instant Pot Duo</a> as it starts off cheaper than the Duo Crisp and it keeps things fairly simple with seven cooking modes. But for those who know a multi-cooker would make their meal prep much easier, and for whom air-fry experimentation sounds exciting, the Duo Crisp is a good investment.

The parents on the Engadget staff know this well, and we’ve tried out a bunch of educational toys with our kids, with various results. These are some of the ones that have had staying power with our children — and even we adults have to admit we found them pretty fun, too.</p><h2>Smart Lab: Smart Circuits</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/818b8ff1-df5a-11eb-bf97-0f6cdaf2522c" alt="Smart Lab: Smart Circuits for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="0668a510-c1f6-3d4a-8427-d648a10064a1"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Will Lipman Photography for Engadget</div></figure><p>When it comes to introducing kids to electronics there are a ton of options, but I personally like the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Smart Circuits kit" href="https://amzn.to/3jhXCVH">Smart Circuits kit</a>. It can take a kid from simple blinking lights to complex motion-controlled games. The snap-together baseboard can lie flat on a table like a regular breadboard, but it can also be folded into a cube or the pieces can be attached at a 90-degree angle. This gives kids an extra element to play with when they graduate to designing their own circuits.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The kit itself only has a few pieces, but they’re quite flexible. And they’re all housed in large colorful plastic that should be easy for a kid to handle. There’s the usual electronics kid fare, like LEDs, a speaker, a potentiometer and two buttons. But there’s also a tilt switch, a light sensor and a microprocessor capable of handling some relatively robust tasks. The kit comes with instructions for 50 projects, but with the parts available a creative child could build quite a few more.</p><p>My one critique is that the jumper wires can be tough to insert and might require a bit of patience — something we know not every eight-year-old has an abundance of.<em>&nbsp;</em>—<em> Terrence O’Brien, Managing Editor</em></p><p><a class="athena-button" data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:amazon;pdid:Buy Smart Circuits at Amazon - $50" href="https://amzn.to/3jhXCVH">Buy Smart Circuits at Amazon - $50</a></p><h2>Playskool Shape Sorter</h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/818b8ff0-df5a-11eb-9dbf-4a1e53e822fe" alt="Playskool Shape Sorter for Engadget&#39;s 2021 Back to School guide." data-uuid="194a562b-b7df-3fda-90b6-b61a11a059a7"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Playskool </div></figure><p>A shape sorter is an awesome toy for younger kids because it encourages hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills, problem-solving and even vocabulary (by identifying the names of shapes and colors).

The lid latches, which means they can’t just dump the shapes out easily; they have to learn how to work the mechanics of the lid as well. Also, the multi-colored shapes have tactile patterns on them that match the area of the box they’re supposed to fit into, and that gives me another teaching opportunity. The whole thing is durable, too — my son likes to chew on the shapes and my daughter likes to stand on the box, but despite that abuse, there’s not so much as a dent or a scratch on it.

Last year, LG unveiled the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lg-puricare-wearable-air-purifier-114505307.html">PuriCare Wearable Air Purifier</a> featuring three fans and a pair of HEPA-style filters. Ten months later, it&#39;s finally <a href="https://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/07/for-top-athletes-breathing-clean-pure-air-while-training-is-now-a-reality/">revealed</a> an initial release date for the device, an improved version of which arrives in Thailand in August. There&#39;s still no word on the price, however.</p><p>The latest iteration features a smaller, lighter motor and a built-in mic, speaker and voice amplifier. LG says its &quot;VoiceOn&quot; tech automatically recognizes when you&#39;re talking and boosts the sound so others can hear you through the mask. Unfortunately, it can&#39;t make you sound like Darth Vader.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>LG has also bumped up the battery from 820mAh to 1,000 mAh, though the stated 8 hour running time is still the same. It&#39;s also touting a two hour recharge time using the included USB cable. The wearable purifier should roll out to more regions upon receiving approval from regulators, the company said.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, LG is promoting the mask with the help of the Thai Olympics team, who wore it en route to the summer games in Tokyo. Clearly, the Korean company is pitching it as a go-to for those who train outdoors. But, LG&#39;s device has its rivals: We&#39;ve previously seen tech-infused masks from <a href="https://www.engadget.com/razer-project-hazel-shipping-early-q4-2021-070156937.html">Razer</a> and, um, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/will-i-am-xupermask-face-mask-140005760.html">Will.i.Am</a>.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/lg-wearable-air-purifier-mic-114651832.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">a6998d41-6871-4a2f-b818-cd16432f336f</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 11:46:51 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626954414</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T11:47:08+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6a8a1eb0-eae1-11eb-afff-f5479425980c" width="1000" height="666" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/6a8a1eb0-eae1-11eb-afff-f5479425980c" width="1000" height="666" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[LG]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[LG mask]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[LG mask]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Morning After: How and where to watch the Japan Olympics]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The Olympics, a year late, are here.

But, even in the face of criticism from the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/joe-biden-facebook-killing-people-vaccine-misinformation-195433641.html">White House</a>, a new report claims Facebook is still failing to delete even the most incendiary misinformation. As recently as last week, posts containing the hashtag #VaccinesKill were still active on the social network, according to <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/08/tech/instagram-vaccine-misinformation/index.html"><em>CNN</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>It was only until the news publication warned the company of the lapse that it blocked the posts behind a message that read Facebook is &quot;keeping our community safe.&quot; To make matters worse, the same hashtag was banned by Facebook-owned <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-05-09-instagram-blocking-anti-vaccine-hashtags.html">Instagram</a> almost two years prior. That action followed Facebook&#39;s pledge to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-facebook-instagram-anti-vaccine-content.html">crack down</a> on vaccine falsehoods, including bogus claims that they cause autism and other diseases, in the midst of a measles outbreak in New York.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>This time round, the threat is even greater. With the world still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, and cases of the Delta virus rising in the US, Facebook&#39;s latest slip-up will only draw more concern from policymakers. Just days ago, President Biden lambasted the company and other social networks by suggesting their failures were debilitating the vaccination drive. “They’re killing people,” Biden said.</p><p>In its defense, Facebook has previously noted that it&#39;s taking down more erroneous anti-vaccine information than ever before. In October, it <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-ads-discouraging-vaccines-165502226.html">banned ads</a> encouraging people to avoid getting vaccinated, following that with a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-vaccine-misinformation-193754704.html">wider clamp down</a> on anti-vaccine claims.&nbsp;</p><p>The company told <em>CNN </em>that it did not take action against the #VaccinesKill hashtag in the past as it did not meet its threshold. Facebook explained that it determines whether a hashtag violates its policies by looking at numerous factors, including the type and spread of content it is appearing in. &quot;Now, the #vaccineskill hashtag on Facebook violates our policies against misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines and we&#39;ve blocked it from search,&quot; the spokesperson said.</p><p>At the same time, users are finding new ways to bypass the social network&#39;s misinformation rules. In May, some people began weaponizing Facebook&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-anti-vaccine-profile-frames-200210989.html">custom profile frames</a> to display false vaccine claims, forcing it to take them down.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/facebook-blocks-vaccines-kill-hashtag-094031580.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">92297cb8-90d5-4062-87ea-ae6dda0138b4</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 09:40:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626947123</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T09:45:44+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[Arts & Entertainment]]></category><category><![CDATA[Social & Online Media]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/389af410-eac8-11eb-b9b7-4c39d8721269" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/389af410-eac8-11eb-b9b7-4c39d8721269" width="4000" height="2667" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Emily Elconin / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Nurses wait for people to come by to receive their coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine at a mobile pop-up vaccination clinic hosted by the Detroit Health Department with the Detroit Public Schools Community District at East English Village Preparatory Academy in Detroit, Michigan, U.S., July 21, 2021.

As first reported by <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-frat-boy-culture"><em>Bloomberg Law</em></a>, the DFEH sued the gaming giant after a two-year investigation wherein it came to the conclusion that the company discriminated against female employees. In addition to receiving smaller salaries than their male counterparts, female employees were also allegedly subjected to constant sexual harassment.</p><p>The DFEH enumerated several findings from its investigation in its <a href="https://aboutblaw.com/YJw">complaint</a> (PDF). Activision Blizzard&#39;s workforce is only about 20 percent women, and very few of them reach top roles in the company, the court document reads. Further, those who do reach higher roles earn less salary and total compensation than their male peers. Other female employees in non-executive roles are also paid less, promoted more slowly and terminated more quickly.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>DFEH also said that the defendant&#39;s &quot;frat boy&quot; culture is a &quot;breeding ground for harassment and discrimination against women.&quot; Female employees constantly have to fend off unwanted sexual comments, the agency wrote. They have to endure being groped during &quot;cube crawls,&quot; in which male employees would drink alcohol as they make their way around various cubicles, as well. The document mentioned one particularly egregious case, in which a female employee took her own life during a business trip with a male supervisor who brought sex toys with him on the trip. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, that employee was severely harassed prior to her death, with her nude photos passed around during a company holiday party.</p><p>Activision Blizzard&#39;s HR department received a lot of harassment, discrimination and retaliation complaints, the DFEH said. However, the defendant allegedly failed to take &quot;effective remedial measures in response&quot; to them. Also, people were apparently discouraged from making complaints, since human resource personnel were known to be close to the alleged harassers.</p><p>The state agency has filed the lawsuit to force the video game titan to comply with California&#39;s workplace protections. It&#39;s also seeking unpaid wages and pay adjustments for female employees.</p><p>Activision Blizzard, however, denies DEFH&#39;s allegations. In a statement, the company said that the agency&#39;s lawsuit &quot;includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard&#39;s past.&quot; It called the DFEH&#39;s complaint &quot;inaccurate&quot; and described the lawsuit as the &quot;type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State&#39;s best businesses out of California.&quot;</p><p>The whole statement, courtesy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-sued-by-california-over-widespread-1847339746"><em>Kotaku</em></a>, reads:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;We value diversity and strive to foster a workplace that offers inclusivity for everyone. There is no place in our company or industry, or any industry, for sexual misconduct or harassment of any kind. We take every allegation seriously and investigate all claims. In cases related to misconduct, action was taken to address the issue.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The DFEH includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past. We have been extremely cooperative with the DFEH throughout their investigation, including providing them with extensive data and ample documentation, but they refused to inform us what issues they perceived. They were required by law to adequately investigate and to have good faith discussions with us to better understand and to resolve any claims or concerns before going to litigation, but they failed to do so. Instead, they rushed to file an inaccurate complaint, as we will demonstrate in court. We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family. While we find this behavior to be disgraceful and unprofessional, it is unfortunately an example of how they have conducted themselves throughout the course of their investigation. It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The picture the DFEH paints is not the Blizzard workplace of today. Over the past several years and continuing since the initial investigation started, we’ve made significant changes to address company culture and reflect more diversity within our leadership teams. We’ve updated our Code of Conduct to emphasize a strict non-retaliation focus, amplified internal programs and channels for employees to report violations, including the “ASK List” with a confidential integrity hotline, and introduced an Employee Relations team dedicated to investigating employee concerns. We have strengthened our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and combined our Employee Networks at a global level, to provide additional support. Employees must also undergo regular anti-harassment training and have done so for many years.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We put tremendous effort in creating fair and rewarding compensation packages and policies that reflect our culture and business, and we strive to pay all employees fairly for equal or substantially similar work. We take a variety of proactive steps to ensure that pay is driven by non-discriminatory factors. For example, we reward and compensate employees based on their performance, and we conduct extensive anti-discrimination trainings including for those who are part of the compensation process.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are confident in our ability to demonstrate our practices as an equal opportunity employer that fosters a supportive, diverse, and inclusive workplace for our people, and we are committed to continuing this effort in the years to come. It is a shame that the DFEH did not want to engage with us on what they thought they were seeing in their investigation.&quot;</p></blockquote>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/california-sues-activision-blizzard-090352763.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">34303078-143e-449d-a383-e2e9465cb573</guid><dc:creator>Mariella Moon</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jul 2021 09:03:52 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626944697</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T09:05:11+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Society & Culture]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Mariella Moon]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eab98e40-eac8-11eb-aefb-94d36d9a725a" width="3792" height="2424" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/eab98e40-eac8-11eb-aefb-94d36d9a725a" width="3792" height="2424" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[UKRAINE - 2021/06/18: In this photo illustration, Activision Blizzard logo of a video game company is seen on a smartphone screen in front of Blizzard Entertainment logo.

According to Twitter Support&#39;s <a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1417957446367252493">announcement</a>, the goal is to be able to gather enough data, so the platform can work on ways to surface more relevant responses. In long threads, for instance, the best replies don&#39;t always show up immediately and might be buried underneath tons of other people&#39;s tweets.</p><p>The random testers who get the feature might see different versions of it. Some may see upvote and downvote buttons, while others might only see a downvote button right next to Twitter&#39;s heart/like option. A third version will show testers thumbs up and down buttons instead. The number of downvotes a reply gets will not be visible to the public, and users&#39; downvotes will be visible to them alone. Meanwhile, upvotes will show up as likes.&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><div id="3ce4a8609cc1458f9320a8ef458cca17"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Some key notes about this experiment:<br><br>1. This is just a test for research right now.<br>2. This is not a dislike button.<br>3. Your downvotes are visible to you only.<br>4.

As Twitter User Researcher Cody Elam explains in a series of tweets, the experiment&#39;s purpose isn&#39;t to shame users, but to give &quot;people the power to privately voice their opinion on the quality of replies&quot; and to give the company a &quot;more nuanced feedback.&quot; He added: &quot;We’re hoping to learn more about the quality of replies that people vote on and if voting is a feature that people find valuable.&quot;</p><div id="0a5336a805db4a6faeea3380fb0c2677"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In past research, we’ve learned which types of replies are considered best when reading conversations:<br><br>•Informative<br>•Supportive<br>•Positive<br>•Funny</p>— Cody Elam (@codyelam) <a href="https://twitter.com/codyelam/status/1417923996473905155?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 21, 2021</a></blockquote></div><p>This isn&#39;t the first time Twitter started testing the Reddit-like feature.

While the update isn’t flush with a litany of new features, these few changes make a world of difference for producers, musicians and DJs alike.</p><p>To record audio, you can use an external input or even just the internal microphone. This accommodates pros and entry level creators with little to no gear beyond the laptop. When recording, even in loop mode, your contiguous session is kept whole. This lets you try different versions of a guitar lick or vocals in a single take that you can trim down to the best segment later. You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LismZjDhbRQ">edit the recordings</a> into clips, use different pieces throughout your project or even layer them in different keys for effect.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Serato Studio 1.6 also keeps recordings in your library for use in other projects. You can sample vinyl directly into your project and by analyzing the file, it will instantly match them to your current BPM. There&#39;s  key detection for the recordings too, which can help keep your vocals on point.</p><p>Those using third-party apps or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s13_AzBq3EI&amp;list=PL0OwIw0MGXQMmEk5eRooUHIP_uvldZnPo">live-streaming</a> will be happy to know that you no longer need plug-ins to make the audio available to other apps. Serato now includes its own Virtual Audio Driver for input and output channels, and even works on Big Sur.</p><p>As always, Studio is great for those using Serato DJ and a controller, but now that audio recording has been added, it has the chops to stand on its own as a production tool. It&#39;s also very intuitive and opens up plenty of opportunities for creative expression without having to jump through hurdles in the process. New users can get the outline of a track rolling in minutes and pros can use it as a sketch pad or to compose full projects quickly.</p><p>Serato Studio 1.6 is available to download today and, as always, there&#39;s a limited free version for you to test drive. To open up all the capabilities and access tons of sounds and samples, you can <a href="https://serato.com/studio/pricing">choose from</a> a $10 monthly subscription or buy it outright for $199 (including all updates for Version 1).</p><div id="0189e06955a34263888842cd69f3f1f0"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G0VA24jDFvM?rel=0" style="top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;border:0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><p></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/serato-studio-audio-recording-music-production-210009386.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">119acdc0-5a6b-4858-9bf5-f0ecaf5bf5e3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Turi</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 21:00:09 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626956966</ingested><modified>2021-07-22T12:29:39+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Audio Technology]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Turi]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cd8f9470-ea34-11eb-ac95-39e777ad2fb6" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/cd8f9470-ea34-11eb-ac95-39e777ad2fb6" width="1920" height="1080" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Serato]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Producer Cor Don records vinyl directly into the Serato Studio app.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Serato Studio]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[FTC votes to fight back against right to repair restrictions]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The US Federal Trade Commission has voted unanimously to tackle unlawful repair restrictions. In a policy statement <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements/1592330/p194400repairrestrictionspolicystatement.pdf">published on Wednesday</a>, the agency said it plans to devote additional resources to enforcing existing laws, such as the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=granuleid%3AUSC-prelim-title15-chapter50&amp;edition=prelim">Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act</a>, that protect small businesses and consumers from companies that would prevent them from fixing on their own products they purchased. In doing so, the FTC will take a five-part approach to the problem that will involve it collecting comments and complaints from the public, as well as working more closely with state law enforcement and policymakers to update existing regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&quot;These types of restrictions can significantly raise costs for consumers, stifle innovation, close off business opportunity for independent repair shops, create unnecessary electronic waste, delay timely repairs, and undermine resiliency,&quot; <a href="https://www.engadget.com/lina-khan-ftc-confirmation-antitrust-big-tech-183254782.html">recently confirmed</a> FTC Chair Lina Khan said. &quot;The FTC has a range of tools it can use to root out unlawful repair restrictions, and today’s policy statement would commit us to move forward on this issue with new vigor.&quot;&nbsp;</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The policy statement follows a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/">July 9th executive order</a> in which President Biden directed the FTC to tackle &quot;unfair anti-competitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items&quot; imposed by &quot;powerful manufacturers&quot; in the farming and technology industries. With Wednesday&#39;s announcement, the FTC didn&#39;t name any specific companies it will target as part of any enforcement action. However, a company like Apple is likely to be top of mind for the agency. The tech giant has consistently <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-05-19-tech-companies-are-trying-to-crush-mom-and-pop-repair-shops.html">lobbied against state-level right to repair legislation</a>, claiming those laws would <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-21-apple-repair-costs.html">put consumers at risk</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Right to repair advocates were quick to praise the announcement. &quot;The FTC sets the tone for the nation’s commerce. For too long, manufacturers have been bullying consumers and driving local repair shops out of business,&quot; iFixit CEO Kyle Wiens said in a <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/51520/ftc-unanimously-approves-policy-of-fighting-repair-restrictions">blog post</a> the company published following the policy announcement. &quot;This landmark new policy changes that.

As of today’s launch, there are more than 50 plugins you can add to your client, including games like <em>Heads Up</em>. Once you install the latest version of Zoom, a “Discover” tab under the new Apps side panel will allow you to see what’s available.</p><p>You can expand and collapse the panel as needed during a call to access the functionality of an app. As one example, the Asana plugin allows you to create, edit and assign tasks without leaving Zoom. Another way to see what’s available is through the <a href="https://marketplace.zoom.us/"><ins>Zoom Marketplace</ins></a>. If you use Zoom for work and you’re part of an organization, your admin can limit what you can install.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Zoom sees third-party integrations as a way to become a platform instead of a single-use app. Much like its new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/zoom-events-platform-130014048.html"><ins>Events</ins></a> hub, which the company <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-events-elevate-virtual-experiences/"><ins>made widely available today</ins></a>, the idea here is to keep the service growing so it can continue on the trajectory it established during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/zoom-third-party-apps-183929305.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">690eb849-ee90-47e7-9296-942c23010af8</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 18:39:29 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626892772</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T18:39:45+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ac8d8b20-ea51-11eb-bdb7-892250ba36f4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/ac8d8b20-ea51-11eb-bdb7-892250ba36f4" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Zoom]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Zoom Apps]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Zoom Apps]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Valve announces a $1 million 'CS:GO' art contest]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/valve"><ins>Valve</ins></a> is on the lookout for new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/csgo-ranked-matches-no-longer-free-to-play-132009460.html"><em><ins>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive</ins></em></a> weapon skins, and it&#39;s hoping to entice creators to submit designs with <a href="http://counter-strike.net/dreams"><ins>a $1 million art contest</ins></a>.

It made the decision soon after the iOS app vanished from the App Store following the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018-11-20-tumblr-pulled-app-store-child-exploitation.html">discovery of child exploitation on Tumblr</a>.</p><p>Monthly page views dipped by almost a third in the months after the porn ban, according to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/tumblr-debuts-post-a-subscription-service-for-gen-z-creators/?tpcc=ECTW2020"><em>TechCrunch</em></a>. The number of daily posts has also dropped over the years from around 67.7 million in 2012 to 11.3 million today.

Until today, you had to go outside of the app to understand what those messages were communicating. Not any more. Instagram has introduced a new feature that will translate any foreign text you see in Stories, and that feature is now rolling out to users across the globe.</p><p>When the app detects you’re viewing a Story in another language, it will display a “See Translation” prompt toward the top left of the interface. All you have to do is tap the banner to see the text in your native tongue. With today’s launch, the feature can translate text between more than 90 languages — though it doesn’t work with audio at the moment. Inevitably that means they’ll be Stories where you might not understand what someone is saying. Still, it’s a step toward making Instagram as inclusive as possible. People can also take advantage of Instagram’s recently added <a href="https://www.engadget.com/instagram-stories-captions-172051963.html">auto-captioning feature</a> to get around the current translation limitation.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/instagram-translate-text-stories-160008406.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">7e52027e-5617-4948-b087-93f07e44282c</guid><dc:creator>Igor Bonifacic</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jul 2021 16:00:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1626880589</ingested><modified>2021-07-21T15:16:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Igor Bonifacic]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64ffbce0-ea35-11eb-a5fc-5caa58c543d2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/64ffbce0-ea35-11eb-a5fc-5caa58c543d2" width="1600" height="1000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Instagram]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Instagram Stories translation]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Instagram Stories translation]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Epic Games buys 3D asset platform Sketchfab]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/tag/epic%20games"><ins>Epic Games</ins></a> seems determined to give developers everything they need to make games in <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tribeca-epic-games-unreal-engine-workshops-indie-filmmakers-182840472.html"><ins>Unreal Engine</ins></a> without having to look elsewhere for parts.
