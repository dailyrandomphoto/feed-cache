The probe follows 11 crashes with parked first responder vehicles since 2018, which resulted in 17 injuries and one death.</p><p>“Most incidents took place after dark and the crash scenes encountered included scene control measures such as first responder vehicle lights, flares, an illuminated arrow board, and road cones,” the NHTSA&#39;s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) wrote in a document <a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/inv/2021/INOA-PE21020-1893.PDF">detailing the investigation</a>. “The involved subject vehicles were all confirmed to have been engaged in either Autopilot or Traffic Aware Cruise Control during the approach to the crashes.”</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>The ODI&#39;s preliminary evaluation centers on Autopilot in Models Y, X, S and 3 from model years 2014 to 2021. That covers around 765,000 Tesla electric vehicles, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-16/tesla-autopilot-investigated-again-by-u-s-over-crashes-ap-says"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>notes. The incidents in question took place between January 2018 and July of this year, including in Massachusetts, Michigan and Arizona. The ODI also cited three crashes in California.</p><p>The Autopilot system keeps the vehicle centered in the lane and maintains speed when it&#39;s active in its Operational Design Domain (ODD). It&#39;s not yet a full self-driving system, however. Drivers still have principal responsibility for Object and Event Detection and Response (OEDR) — identifying and responding to obstacles, vehicles and &quot;adverse maneuvers&quot; by other drivers.</p><p>&quot;The investigation will additionally assess the OEDR by vehicles when engaged in Autopilot mode, and ODD in which the Autopilot mode is functional. The investigation will also include examination of the contributing circumstances for the confirmed crashes&quot; mentioned in the document as well as similar crashes, the ODI wrote.</p><p>The NHTSA <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016-06-30-tesla-under-investigation-after-first-autopilot-related-death.html">investigated</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2017-01-19-investigation-clears-tesla-for-fatal-autopilot-crash.html">cleared</a> Tesla over the first Autopilot-related death in 2016. Since then, the agency has opened dozens of other probes into incidents in which it believes Autopilot was involved. In June, the NHTSA ordered automakers to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nhtsa-automated-driving-system-crash-report-174552853.html">report incidents</a> involving semi- and fully autonomous driving systems within 24 hours of learning about them.</p><p>Earlier this year, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) <a href="https://www.engadget.com/ntsb-nhtsa-letter-tesla-210752970.html">urged the NHTSA</a> to issue stricter regulations for autonomous driving, citing Tesla in its letter. &quot;Tesla recently<a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-expansion-8-3-171559184.html"> released a beta version of its Level 2 Autopilot system</a>, described as having <a href="https://www.engadget.com/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-october-20-171500591.html">full self-driving capability</a>,&quot; NTSB chair Robert Sumwalt wrote. &quot;By releasing the system, Tesla is testing on public roads a highly automated AV technology but with limited oversight or reporting requirements.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/tesla-autopilot-investigation-nhtsa-141310451.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d96a1d84-628b-4417-bc66-3a5ede8d25a4</guid><dc:creator>Kris Holt</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 14:13:10 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629123231</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T14:14:07+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Transportation]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Kris Holt]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/30065400-c4c3-11eb-b9ef-1f964935a881" width="7836" height="5224" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-06/30065400-c4c3-11eb-b9ef-1f964935a881" width="7836" height="5224" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NICOLAS ASFOURI via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The inside of a Tesla car Model 3 is seen at a Tesla shop inside of a shopping Mall in Beijing on May 26, 2021.

But there are still some companies that still need those chipsets — ASUS being a notable example. The Taiwanese electronics giant&#39;s <a href="https://www.engadget.com/asus-rog-phone-5-gaming-phone-112327496.html">ROG phones</a> have high-end components aimed at the most demanding users and mobile gamers.</p><p>That&#39;s exactly the audience for the new &quot;Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders,&quot; a phone that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-snapdragon-insiders-150023369.html">Qualcomm built with help from ASUS &quot;for its fans&quot;</a>. It boasts features like a 6.8-inch screen with a 144Hz refresh rate, comprehensive 5G support, fast charging and special audio enhancements. Clearly, this $1,499 device is a showcase for Qualcomm’s strengths, and though its name says it’s for Snapdragon Insiders, anyone can buy it. But should you?</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><h2>Design</h2><p>That depends on a few things, one of which being your preference on phone sizes. This is a <em>big</em> phone. At 210 grams (or 0.46 pounds), the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders (which I’m going to call SSI from now on) is one of the heavier phones I’ve used recently. Many devices with such large screens tend to weigh about the same — the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-snapdragon-865-plus-5g-s-pen-price-140017843.html">Galaxy Note 20 Ultra</a> is lighter, but the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-iphone-12-pro-max-review-cameras-battery-price-233156949.html">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-specs-price-cameras-snapdragon-888-160013665.html">Galaxy S21 Ultra</a> are actually even heavier.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b896ca10-fc82-11eb-bb79-7b298f7f8851" alt="A man holding the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders. The picture shows the phone in his hands, with its rear facing us." data-uuid="a119c96e-bf89-38db-b1f9-a6d8c18d5b1a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The SSI also looks notably different from the iPhones and Galaxies which, depending on your taste, could be a good or bad thing. Its rounded rectangle body has a matte blue finish with shiny red accents on the camera bump and volume button. And you know how bezels for selfie cameras went away over the last two years on most flagships? That’s not the case here — there’s still a thin border above the screen where the sensor sits. That, combined with the silhouette and finish, make the SSI look pretty outdated.</p><p>Another polarizing feature on the SSI is an illuminated Qualcomm Snapdragon fireball icon on the rear, below the fingerprint sensor. You can set the light to “breathe” (i.e., glow on and off), turn it off altogether, or have it stay on all day. Even when it’s not lit, though, the logo is pretty obvious. It adds clutter to the phone, and made feeling for the fingerprint scanner confusing whenever I wanted to unlock the device without looking at its back.</p><p>One last note on design: The bump for the SSI’s triple-camera array on the back is a surprisingly compact horizontal row that’s neatly tucked away in the top left. It’s smaller and thinner than those on the Galaxy and iPhones, though it still protrudes enough that the handset doesn’t lie flat when you put it on a table.</p><h2>Display</h2><p>Topping the list of the SSI’s premium specs is its display. The AMOLED panel is from Samsung, and it runs at 2,448 x 1,080. It also refreshes at 144Hz, which is one of the fastest on modern smartphones, beating the Galaxy S21 and Note series, not to mention the iPhone family. To ensure that you’re shooting at your enemies as quickly as you can tap on them, the display also offers a 1ms response time.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/f24f6690-fc82-11eb-afc1-7d38c1e1e07c" alt="A man holding the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders with its screen facing out. " data-uuid="0dd3f835-6a28-3397-b2b0-2eed2057bcee"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I furiously scrolled up and down on the Engadget homepage, as well as my Instagram feed, and the display kept pace with my finger. Shooting at my enemies on <em>League of Legends Wild Rift</em> was similarly responsive, and a first-person shooter like <em>Call Of Duty</em> was also satisfyingly speedy.</p><p>Since it’s an AMOLED panel, it also delivers vibrant colors and deep blacks on videos and photos. Its peak brightness of 1,200 nits also makes for easy viewing under sunlight. It’s worth noting, though, that the 20.4:9 aspect ratio causes some content to be cut off — the ends of long messages in Telegram, for example, disappear into the edges of the screen. Qualcomm doesn’t appear to have optimized its display to accommodate all apps.</p><h2>Audio</h2><p>The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders is one of the first to feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Sound technology, which promises low Bluetooth latency, multiple listening profiles and smart amplifier software. It also has four mics and Qualcomm’s “High Dynamic Range Audio Record,” which the company says is capable of delivering studio-quality recording. The SSI comes with a pair of wireless Master and Dynamic earbuds, too, but most of the audio enhancements will work through the phone’s speakers too.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/77d03060-fc83-11eb-bbf7-62ed326e4467" alt="Side view of the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders laid on a wooden surface, showing its power and volume buttons on the right edge." data-uuid="5c088e75-34f9-3dc3-a642-3e02cde28800"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>The Master &amp; Dynamic headphones were built using Qualcomm’s Bluetooth Audio SoC and will support high-res 24-bit 96kHz audio with active noise cancellation. Qualcomm also said these should stay connected to your phone even if there are lots of other RF devices around, so audio drop-outs should be minimal.</p><p>I haven’t visited many busy places during my testing, so I can’t vouch for how well these headphones stay connected in those situations. Plus, the headphones that Qualcomm sent reviewers were pre-production and do “not reflect commercial-ready Snapdragon sound quality.” The company said that when the devices do ship later this month, they’ll have features like high-res audio and super wide band voice for greater call clarity. For now, though, all I can say is the earbuds perform fine. Songs like “Say So” by Doja Cat and “Next Level” by aespa also sounded richer than on the Pixel Buds 2.</p><p>The SSI itself also delivered loud and clear audio, though I don’t usually expect great quality from phone speakers since I rarely play music through them. Sound effects and background tracks on games and YouTube videos rang out nicely, and that’s pretty much all I need from a phone’s sound system.</p><h2>Cameras</h2><p>Like many modern flagships, the SSI has a trio of cameras on its rear. The 64-megapixel main sensor with f/1.8 aperture is accompanied by a 12-megapixel ultrawide option and an 8-megapixel telephoto. That’s a pretty typical setup, though the main camera here is sharper than those you’ll find on iPhones and Pixels.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/9e3bb300-fc83-11eb-b5bf-0187535f5e80" alt="A close up view of the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders&#39; three rear cameras at an angle. " data-uuid="1a13c29c-e847-3d80-9a1a-9dd7e53ebf0c"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Qualcomm said an over-the-air update is coming later this month that will enable, among other things, a full resolution mode for better “snapshot performance.”</p><p>Other enhancements that the update is supposed to bring include “better texture/noise performance,” “improved night shot quality,” “Video Super Resolution,” “upgraded camera tuning” and “best autofocus experience.” The company said it will also “fully optimize” HDR via the ultra-wide and telephoto cameras and multi-frame noise reduction. That’s far too many things coming that could sway how I feel about the camera, and I wish they were available to test before the phone hits shelves later this month. For now, I’m supposed to take Qualcomm’s word for it and that’s not how reviews work.</p><p>Without the updated software, the SSI delivered lackluster photos that paled in comparison to the Note 20 Ultra and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5-review-camera-performance-battery-price-150051832.html">Pixel 5’s</a>. The Qualcomm phone’s images had a blue (sometimes green) cast and weren’t significantly sharper or clearer than the Pixel’s, which costs hundreds less. Google’s portrait mode is also superior, and it never failed to keep the lantern fly I was taking pictures of in focus. Meanwhile, the insect came out blurry in 90 percent of the shots on the SSI.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/01e43df0-fc84-11eb-93ef-dd22b86f24a7" alt="A screenshot of the camera app in the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders, demonstrating an Auto Tracking video recording mode. There is a yellow square surrounding a man and Stop and Pause buttons on the right.. " data-uuid="a2779ca9-2215-343d-85f8-2e8d3a3c58eb"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Screenshot (Cherlynn Low / Engadget)</div></figure><p>One thing I was able to test is a unique Auto Tracking mode. Qualcomm re-architected its AI engine to run machine-learning-based tasks better, and one of these features is an Auto Zoom tool in the camera. When you use the Auto Tracking mode, you can tap on the viewfinder to designate a subject, and the camera will automatically adjust framing to make sure your pet or loved one is always in the scene.</p><p>And by the way, this isn’t an autofocus tool that makes sure your kids or fur babies always look clear. Qualcomm’s method will actually zoom in and out to give your selected subject the spotlight. When this worked, like when I shot a clip of our video producer, Brian Oh’s adorable dog Zen as she ambled around the room, it was lovely. The camera zoomed in till Zen’s face took up half the screen and we were staring into her soulful eyes, and zoomed out when she moved out of frame so we always saw her.</p><p>But in my testing, the system was not always good at identifying people’s faces and separating them from the background. That would be fine if it simply didn’t do anything in those cases, but the resulting footage was nauseatingly jerky and looked like the camera was searching for the subject. This is a nice tool in theory, but even if it worked perfectly I’m not convinced I’d use it much.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/c2602bd0-fc83-11eb-95ff-fc3670601a24" alt="The Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders with its rear facing the camera against a yellow background. " data-uuid="788f5ce3-0443-3089-bdc1-13d023c2dc43"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>Another thing I’m not sure I like is the 24-megapixel front camera. Sharper sensors are nice in general, but the better clarity here didn’t make a big difference over selfies shot on other phones. Again, I don’t know if the coming OTA update will be effective so I can only evaluate the selfie camera as I’ve experienced it.</p><h2>Performance and battery life</h2><p>With a Snapdragon 888 CPU, 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage, the SSI has plenty of muscle and ran smoothly for most of my time with it. I encountered occasional hiccups when shooting portrait mode pictures in rapid succession and when trying to shift focus in auto-tracking mode, but those are pretty specific to the camera. When I played <em>League of Legends Wild Rift</em> with screen recording on, the phone never lagged.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the SSI often ran hot, though. After a couple of minutes of concurrent gaming and screen-recording, or a few attempts at capturing video in auto-tracking mode, or even just a round of <em>Settlers of Catan</em>, the area below the fingerprint sensor got noticeably warm.</p><p>The 4,000mAh battery here typically got me through a day and a half, and sometimes more, which is impressive given its screen size and refresh rate. That’s also in line with most devices in this class, like the Note 20 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro Max, and better than the S21 Ultra.</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/4ab32870-fc84-11eb-8d7c-e4b7ae2b56b3" alt="A man using the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders" data-uuid="d9630184-ef58-370d-b837-70a0b753cfca"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low / Engadget</div></figure><p>I didn’t go out a lot so I wasn’t using 5G much — if you’re a heavy data user or you set the logo on the back to stay lit all day, the runtime will likely drop. Speaking of, the SSI supports both mmWave and sub-6 5G, though your experience of the speed improvements this brings will depend largely on your carrier and service area.</p><p>When you do run out of juice, it won’t take too long to get recharged. Qualcomm includes a Quick Charge 5 adaptor in the box that it says will get you up to 70 percent in 30 minutes or a full charge in 52 minutes. I did get the phone fully charged in under an hour, which is impressive given the generous battery size.</p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>On paper, the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders seems like a spec chaser’s dream. But headline features like Snapdragon Sound aren’t ready yet, 5G performance is reliant on your carrier and coverage, while the camera is still pending a major update that <em>may</em> improve performance. Not only does this phone seem like it’s not ready for review, it also feels far too niche. Even demanding users who might like a smartphone like this will get more out of a Galaxy Ultra or the OnePlus 9 Pro. Unless you’re a rabid Qualcomm fan or need a beefy, long-lasting honker of a phone with a 144Hz screen, few people should get the Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/qualcomm-asus-smartphone-for-snapdragon-insiders-review-140014488.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">10c4da51-ff66-4e27-860e-1a540c3a8fb5</guid><dc:creator>Cherlynn Low</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 14:00:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629123243</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T14:14:21+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Cherlynn Low]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc457b10-fe9b-11eb-946d-38746d613343" width="2000" height="1283" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/fc457b10-fe9b-11eb-946d-38746d613343" width="2000" height="1283" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Cherlynn Low / Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The ASUS Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders photographed in front of a yellow background.]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[ASUS Smartphone for Snapdragon Insiders]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon knocks up to 30 percent off Echo devices in its 'off to college' sale]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Regardless of if you&#39;re personally heading back to school in a few weeks, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Amazon&#39;s latest sale" href="https://amzn.to/3xL61EN">Amazon&#39;s latest sale</a> is a good opportunity for anyone to grab a new Echo device. In addition to Fire tablets and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-fire-tv-cube-sale-100-164733265.html">Fire TV devices</a>, both the Echo Dot and the regular Echo smart speakers have been discounted — the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo Dot" href="https://amzn.to/3yTexCO">Echo Dot</a> is down to $35 while the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:amazon;pdid:Echo" href="https://amzn.to/3m8NT5s">Echo</a> is on sale for $80.

We included it in our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/school-tech-under-50-140026676.html">back-to-school gift guide</a> because it&#39;s a handy little speaker to have for impromptu dance parties, plus it it takes up very little space on a desk and it&#39;s quite cheap even when not on sale. Alexa can also answer basic questions that could help students in the middle of a study session, although we wouldn&#39;t recommend relying on the personal assistant for homework answers. Overall, we gave the Dot a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-echo-dot-clock-2020-review-143052099.html">score of 88</a> from us for its solid audio quality for the price, tap-to-snooze alarm and attractive orb-like design.</p><p>if you have more space to spare, the Echo is one of <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-22-smart-speakers-guide-google-amazon-echo-sonos.html">our favorite smart speakers</a> as of late. It combines a three-inch woofer with two 0.8-inch tweeters to produce louder sound than both Google&#39;s Nest Audio and the HomePod mini. The audio quality is great, and if you have two in your home, you can use them as a stereo pair for an even better experience. We also appreciate that, like the Echo Dot, the standard Echo has a 3.5mm audio jack, letting you connect the speaker to another playback device like a turntable.</p><p>Ultimately, though, an Echo device is best if Alexa is your virtual assistant of choice. Alexa has gotten more useful over the years and there are thousands of Skills that you can install and use to make your experience more personalized. If you&#39;ve been meaning to add to your smart home system, or you&#39;ve wanted to build one from the ground up, an Echo device is a good place to start — especially when you can grab a few at a discount.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/amazon-off-to-college-sale-echo-smart-speaker-echo-dot-echo-dot-kids-edition-133014968.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">fd7c1293-6254-4b42-8e6c-a9423f5c2047</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 13:30:14 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629119236</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T13:07:34+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/15507cb0-2b4b-11eb-a7f2-e43dad8c267e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/15507cb0-2b4b-11eb-a7f2-e43dad8c267e" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[Amazon knocks up to 30 percent off Echo devices in its &#39;off to college&#39; sale]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Amazon's Fire and Fire Kids tablets are on sale for up to 40 percent off]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Amazon is known for making affordable tablets that get the basics right.

The beta version of the Android Accessibility Suite — which was part of the fourth Android 12 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-4-platform-stability-google-171004146.html">beta</a> that recently arrived on Pixel handsets — includes a neat new way to control your phone. &quot;Camera Switches&quot; essentially lets you use face gestures to complete a number of actions. For instance, you can set the app to detect when you smile or raise an eyebrow in order to open your notifications panel or quick settings. You can also open your mouth to scroll forward or backward. As spotted by <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-with-face/"><em>XDA Developers</em></a><em>, </em>the update lets you map around six face gestures to over a dozen phone controls. These can also be tweaked based on gesture size to prevent the app from constantly initiating actions.</p><p>Camera Switches builds upon the Switch Access feature in Android Accessibility Suite, which lets you interact with your device without using the touchscreen. Depending on the context, this can be done using an external device, such as a keyboard, via a USB or Bluetooth connection, or by pressing the built-in buttons on your phone. In that sense, Camera Switches takes the feature up a notch by introducing gestures to the mix. Seeing as most people are already accustomed to unlocking their phones with their face, the new additions shouldn&#39;t seem completely foreign.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>While using Camera Switches, you&#39;ll see a persistent notification icon that indicates your camera is being used. However, as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/android-12-beta-hands-on-181528378.html">Android 12</a>&#39;s privacy dashboard already includes a status indicator for both the camera and mic, this feature may be unnecessary. <em>XDA </em>was also able to sideload the app&#39;s APK to get the new feature on Android 11.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-face-114800871.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">6950ce5c-5fa3-4037-b105-757918adb2a4</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 11:48:31 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629114513</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T11:48:46+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Cameras & Photography]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[Handheld & Connected Devices]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a99d83f0-fe85-11eb-8ffd-2a99d94cc2b3" width="5607" height="3683" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/a99d83f0-fe85-11eb-8ffd-2a99d94cc2b3" width="5607" height="3683" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[NurPhoto via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[Android logo is seen displayed on a phone screen in this illustration photo taken in Tehatta, West Bengal, India on April 27, 2021.

The Pixel 5a could appear any day now, according to the latest reports from, of all places, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5a-parts-leak-210709004.html">repair shops</a>. The latest rumors include a larger battery (4,680mAh battery up from 3,800mAh) and an August 17th release date — which would be tomorrow.</p><a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-5a-parts-leak-210709004.html"><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/8deb53b0-fe0a-11eb-b73f-19f1251153e0" alt="Google Pixel 4a 5G back from review" data-uuid="a3a82de8-5ace-3ed9-bda5-55a8e41a7708"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Cherlynn Low/Engadget</div></figure></a><p>We’re already expecting the Pixel 5a to land with a dual-camera system and a headphone jack, the latter of which is rare in 2021.

Similarly priced phones may look the same on paper, but the Pixel’s imaging capabilities, which lean hard on AI and software, typically produce great images in most situations. I’m sure the Pixel 5a is likely to continue this winning formula — even if it lacks that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pixel-6-pro-first-look-tensor-processor-better-cameras-160005582.html">homemade Google chip</a>.</p><p>— Mat Smith</p><p></p><h2><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-3d-printer-moon-regolith-iss-215332227.html https://www.engadget.com/...">NASA sends a 3D printing system for lunar soil to its space station</a></h2><h3>It could help plan for future Moon and Mars habitats.</h3><a href="https://www.engadget.com/nasa-3d-printer-moon-regolith-iss-215332227.html https://www.engadget.com/..."><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b476c1d0-fd43-11eb-b379-6dbf01dfe68a" alt="Render of NASA astronaut holding Moon regolith" data-uuid="6b208123-7aa6-33de-8888-1f736ba5b874"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">NASA</div></figure></a><p>NASA&#39;s latest International Space Station resupply mission included a machine meant to demonstrate 3D printing regolith (loose soil or rock) on the Moon and similar extraterrestrial surfaces.</p><p>The Redwire Regolith Print (RRP) project will work in tandem with an existing printer system (ManD) to try 3D printing simulated regolith.

That&#39;s $70 off the normal price of the popular wireless earbuds, which remain our <a href="https://www.engadget.com/best-wireless-earbuds-120058222.html">top pick</a> for iOS users. The Amazon deal currently lists the Pro for $190, but an extra $10 discount is automatically applied at checkout.

Chiefly, the Pro deliver superior sound thanks to their active noise cancelation and support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/airpods-pro-firmware-update-spatial-audio-083143292.html">spatial audio</a>. Apple even claims the buds can customize your listening experience by using Adaptive EQ to tune music to the shape of your ear.&nbsp;</p><p>They look different to the AirPods, too. The Pro have shorter stems and are a bit wider, making for a more crowdpleasing design. While the addition of silicone ear tips in different sizes results in a more comfortable fit compared to the regular AirPods. They&#39;re also better gym buddies courtesy of their sweat and water resistance.</p><p>Seeing as the Pro dropped in 2019, you may be wondering about new upgrades. Rumors indicate that new <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-airpods-third-generation-leak-205121774.html">AirPods</a> could be imminent this holiday season. Reports also claim that the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-next-gen-airpods-pro-smaller-design-121846608.html">next</a> AirPods Pro will <a href="https://www.engadget.com/apple-new-air-pods-pro-fitness-2022-125843385.html">focus on fitness tracking</a>. Of course, none of that matters if you want to upgrade right away. In which case, you can&#39;t go wrong with the current Pros, especially if you&#39;re an iPhone owner. The lower price is the icing on the cake.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/apples-air-pods-pro-fall-back-to-180-the-second-lowest-price-weve-seen-085820239.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">8df7cacc-e4a8-4c16-997b-4074db09c53d</guid><dc:creator>Saqib Shah</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 08:58:50 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629115670</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T12:08:05+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Personal Investing Ideas & Strategies]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Saqib Shah]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3703de0-fe6d-11eb-bff8-f9ba0768a75b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/b3703de0-fe6d-11eb-bff8-f9ba0768a75b" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[AirPods Pro                                    ]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[AirPods Pro]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Switch is the first console to sweep Japan's game sales chart in 33 years]]></title><description type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-03-07-nintendo-switch-review-two-years.html">Nintendo Switch</a> isn&#39;t struggling to compete against the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/sony-playstation-5-review-130048353.html">PlayStation 5</a> on its home turf in Japan... far from it.  <a href="https://twitter.com/GameDataLibrary/status/1426003162889134082">Game Data Library</a>, <a href="https://www.axios.com/nintendo-gaming-charts-195b69e0-4d16-44fa-90cf-c2305dad05de.html"><em>Axios</em></a> and <a href="https://in.ign.com/nintendo-nx-1/164591/news/nintendo-switch-sweeps-japanese-sales-chart-a-feat-that-hasnt-been-accomplished-in-30-years"><em>IGN</em></a> report that every game on <em>Famitsu</em>&#39;s August 8th weekly <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/ranking/game-sales/">Top 30</a> chart was a Switch title, ranging from <em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> in 30th place to <em>Minecraft</em> at the top. It&#39;s reportedly the first time a platform has swept that chart since November 1988, when Nintendo&#39;s own Famicom (the basis for the NES) dominated the list.</p><p>Nintendo has controlled the Japanese games chart with multiple platforms before. In the early 1990s, the Famicom, Super Famicom (aka Super NES) and Game Boy cemented its position. It&#39;s much harder for a single system to rule the rankings, though.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>There&#39;s also a sharp contrast with the US. While the Switch has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/npd-video-game-spending-record-march-2021-144536464.html">outsold rival consoles</a> in the country and frequently thrives in game sales (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/zelda-skyward-sword-hd-nintendo-switch-230230304.html"><em>Skyward Sword HD</em></a> was July&#39;s best-selling game), it typically faces stiffer competition from the PlayStation and Xbox ecosystems.</p><p>There wasn&#39;t a direct explanation for the sweep, although the titles reflect both Nintendo&#39;s influence and local tastes. Most of the games are either Nintendo&#39;s (including <em>Skyward Sword</em> and <em>Mario Kart 8</em>) or come from franchises that have long been popular in Japan, such as <a href="https://www.engadget.com/nintendo-switch-monster-hunter-rise-limited-edition-155516717.html"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, <em>Taiko no Tatsujin</em> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/dragon-quest-12-041721411.html"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a>. It also helps that Japan is in the grips of its largest-ever COVID-19 pandemic wave — people may be buying Switch games to keep them and their kids entertained at home.</p><p>Whatever the reason, the feat suggests why Nintendo isn&#39;t in a rush to upgrade the Switch beyond <a href="https://www.engadget.com/new-nintendo-switch-oled-131324519.html">modest revisions</a>.

In a statement from earlier in the dispute, the company acknowledged the duplicate system in China but maintained that it was strictly a test version &quot;physically isolated&quot; from the real network, making it impossible to extract data. An overseer for the Lahore effort, Muhammad Kamran Khan, said an investigation was underway but that there wasn&#39;t any evidence of data theft &quot;so far.&quot;</p><p>Whoever is telling the truth, the lawsuit highlights the ongoing concerns that Huawei might be aiding China&#39;s surveillance goals. The company has long denied the allegations, and there isn&#39;t yet &quot;smoking gun&quot; evidence that it has used backdoors to snoop on other countries. However, that hasn&#39;t allayed suspicions that have led the US, UK and others to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/huawei-files-us-lawsuit-disputing-fcc-security-threat-designation-172919533.html">blacklist its technology</a>. This case might only exacerbate Huawei&#39;s situation, even if BES&#39; assertions don&#39;t hold up in court.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/huawei-contractor-pakistan-backdoor-194308607.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">b3d76098-7882-451e-99e1-37052c42347a</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 19:43:08 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629117854</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T12:44:29+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Business]]></category><category><![CDATA[Company Legal & Law Matters]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/199c07d0-fdeb-11eb-9feb-3d2676895ca0" width="5137" height="3363" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/199c07d0-fdeb-11eb-9feb-3d2676895ca0" width="5137" height="3363" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Wolfgang Rattay / reuters]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[The logo of the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies is pictured next to a statue on top of a building in Copenhagen, Denmark, June 23, 2021.

Intelligence officer and initiative leader John Cohen told <em>The</em><em>Wall Street Journal</em> in an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/homeland-security-considers-outside-firms-to-analyze-social-media-after-jan-6-failure-11629025200?mod=rss_Technology">interview</a> that Homeland Security is looking at hiring companies to analyze social networks for signs of impending terrorism and other extremist violence. The department had been studying social media before, but the outside partners would help &quot;dramatically&quot; expand these efforts, Cohen said.</p><p>Murmurs of extensive social media scanning first surfaced in May, but there were few details about how it would work. The rumors suggested Homeland Security would focus on alarming trends rather than individual targets, such as brewing extremist movements or threats against specific communities. The aim is to catch the violent rhetoric behind events like the January 6th <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-bans-stop-the-steal-ahead-of-inaguration-214239970.html">Capitol riot</a>, which Homeland Security didn&#39;t anticipate despite mounting social media activity.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>One of the companies involved in discussions is Logically, a firm that uses a mix of AI and human analysis to track online content at a large scale. It was previously involved in a government effort to fight <a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-tool-voter-misinformation-report-190524785.html">voting misinformation</a>, but here could use publicly accessible social media to spot trouble.</p><p>Whether or not Homeland Security can address privacy fears is another matter. Cohen said the department wouldn&#39;t use companies to acquire information it was restricted from seeing, and <em>Journal</em> sources said officials were determined to protect civil liberties. Logically chief Lyric Jain said his company couldn&#39;t share personal data for Americans without court orders.</p><p>Even so, there are concerns Homeland Security could abuse this private analysis. It could theoretically hold on to content and use the data to pursue unrelated criminal cases or target peaceful political dissent. That could chill free speech by making people afraid to talk about certain subjects in public channels, even if there are no discussions of violent intentions.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/homeland-security-social-media-search-plans-152947703.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">be4d31e9-501c-44b1-9e0a-db0ae62f35d3</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sun, 15 Aug 2021 15:29:47 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1629120500</ingested><modified>2021-08-16T13:28:40+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Politics & Government]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-01/f88fcd10-1a8f-11e9-97ad-3f9c9fb1dc1d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-01/f88fcd10-1a8f-11e9-97ad-3f9c9fb1dc1d" width="3000" height="2000" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Anadolu Agency via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[WASHINGTON, USA - MARCH 7: The Department of Homeland Security logo is seen on a law enforcement vehicle in Washington, United States on March 7, 2017.

It was built to handle high demand, but it wasn&#39;t meant to cope with an <a href="https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-expands-to-39-new-territories-082604619.html">increasingly global</a> audience streaming much more than <em>Game of Thrones</em>.</p><p>An HBO Max app revamp will supposedly provide both modern underpinnings and, importantly, room to grow. The unnamed executive said the new app won&#39;t look much different at first, but should allow for a more &quot;sophisticated&quot; interface update as well as new and upgraded features.</p><p>If accurate, this could be important to HBO Max&#39;s long-term future. The TV streaming space is increasingly crowded with rivals like <a href="https://www.engadget.com/star-trek-lower-decks-season-two-premiere-strange-energies-070032163.html">Paramount+</a> and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/universal-films-tv-debut-peacock-041027104.html">Peacock</a> joining incumbents like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. You might easily lose interest in HBO Max if buggy apps sour the experience, no matter how alluring the content might be — and that will be particularly important once WarnerMedia stops <a href="https://www.engadget.com/every-2021-warner-bros-film-will-simulcast-on-hbo-max-and-in-theaters-184336206.html">releasing brand new movies</a> on the service.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hbo-max-smart-tv-app-overhaul-173225888.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">d32cb145-c67c-4e03-a716-e6445e01ee9b</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 17:32:25 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628962348</ingested><modified>2021-08-14T17:32:43+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Mobile Apps]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/276125f0-e6fb-11eb-bff8-e21d1689d2e3" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/276125f0-e6fb-11eb-bff8-e21d1689d2e3" width="5000" height="3333" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[SOPA Images via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[BRAZIL - 2021/06/03: In this photo illustration a close-up of a hand holding a TV remote control seen displayed in front of the HBO Max logo.

This week, Billy Steele lent his ears to Samsung’s new entry level Galaxy Buds 2 to check out their new design and features. A little while ago, Terrence O’Brien created beautiful music on the Novation Circuit Rhythm sampler and struggled with the controls on the SkulptSynth SE. Devindra Hardawar also experienced immersive VR courtesy of two professional headsets from HTC. Lastly, Daniel Cooper checked out Framework’s repairable laptop to see just how easy it is to customize and fix.</p><h2>Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 2 <a href="https://www.engadget.com/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-150002889.html">offer premium features at an affordable price</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/efd486d0-faa6-11eb-b94f-10d8b46c6c7b" alt="Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 revivew" data-uuid="d85d267f-eaf1-3d9f-8f6e-219ac49d7b5a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Billy Steele/Engadget</div></figure><p>Affordable wireless earbuds often come with compromises, but Billy Steele feels that Samsung has found a winning combination with the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Galaxy Buds 2" href="https://fave.co/3iGTSwg">Galaxy Buds 2</a>. Redesigned to include wireless charging and ambient sound at an entry-level price of $150, the Galaxy Buds 2 are 15 percent smaller and 20 percent lighter than the Galaxy Buds+, which makes them comfortable to wear. Billy says that the sound quality, though improved, doesn’t have quite the same clarity and depth, but the dynamic range is comparable. Low-end tones lack punch and tracks that should sound big and bombastic are a bit flat and subdued.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>That being said, he was still impressed by the inclusion of active noise-cancellation, which Samsung says can reduce 98 percent of background noise. Billy could still hear a bit of his box fans and white noise machine during testing, but the feature was definitely better than relying solely on passive isolation. He felt that Samsung delivered on the call quality improvements as well, via a combination of machine learning, three microphones per bud and a voice-pickup unit to maximize clarity. He managed to get around seven hours of battery life from “regular” use (which included some ANC), but was disappointed that the Buds 2 only have an IPX2 rating, which could produce issues during sweaty workout.</p><h2>HTC&#39;s Vive Pro 2 produces an incredible virtual reality experience — <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-pro-2-review-5k-vr-headset-133100685.html">but it comes at a steep price</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e3553b70-eb10-11eb-adbb-58d3a3230e93" alt="HTC Vive Pro 2" data-uuid="6ae80b9d-4f42-3655-b669-12c7a13e7b8a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar liked <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HTC&#x002019;s Vive Pro 2" href="https://fave.co/3zhTpWI">HTC’s Vive Pro 2</a> VR headset so much he called it “an enthusiast’s dream.” However, he’s quick to point out that its $1,399 price tag makes it a tough sell. The Vive Pro 2 offers a 5K 120Hz display with 2,448 x 2,448 pixels per eye. Additionally, the LCDs have RGB sub-pixels that help to produce the sharpest desktop VR experience that he’s ever seen. It also has solid ergonomics — Devindra says the headset is comfortable to wear for extended sessions due to its weight distribution and its plush cushioning on the front and back.</p><p>But even if you’re prepared to shell out for the headset, Devindra admits it comes with some drawbacks. First, the controllers are the same archaic, oversized ones that came with the original 2016 Vive. He also felt that the on-ear headphones produced some heat during use, as did the displays. But the biggest issue is the graphics power necessary to experience the device in its full glory: Devindra says you can probably forget about getting anything truly usable out of the system’s minimum requirements, which means you’ll need a lot of desktop power to get the most out of the Vive Pro 2. Despite those hurdles, he’s quick to call the Vive Pro 2 the highest quality desktop VR available right now.</p><h2>Framework’s modular laptop <a href="https://www.engadget.com/framework-laptop-review-150001399.html">can be repaired by anyone</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/e1867930-e93f-11eb-8de5-0d0581187a5b" alt="Framework Laptop Hero Image" data-uuid="d5a7ef23-e2fe-38d2-bd6b-eb1e66dce77a"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Daniel Cooper</div></figure><p><a href="https://frame.work/">Framework’s laptop</a> isn’t eye-catching or showy. The design of the 13-inch notebook resembles an older MacBook, but with one noteworthy difference: it’s intended to be modded and repaired via the included Torx T5 screwdriver and the expansion cards. While testing how easy it was to replace a keyboard, Daniel Cooper said he felt fully confident that he could make multiple repairs to the machine — something that can’t be said for most consumer laptops.</p><p>In addition to being easy to upgrade and fix, the Framework features a solid spec list: a 13.5-inch, 3:2, 2,256 x 1,504 display with a backlight capable of 400 nits; a variety of inputs via the expansion cards as well as a 3.5mm headphone jack; a chiclet keyboard with 1.5mm of travel and an impressive 1080p, 60fps webcam with an 80-degree field of view. During testing, the $1,399 Performance model handled undemanding games well and scored an average 4927 in PC Mark 10. The only thing Daniel didn’t enjoy about the machine were the side-firing speakers, which produced weak, tinny sound.</p><h2>The HTC Vive Focus 3 is a <a href="https://www.engadget.com/htc-vive-focus-3-review-standalone-vr-headset-163044765.html">premium VR workhorse</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/2878f661-e4bd-11eb-b7bb-d183f7158f02" alt="HTC Vive Focus 3" data-uuid="f4f40b8c-822e-3409-9a78-d0ee1770933d"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Much like the Vive Pro 2, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:HTC&#x002019;s Vive Focus 3" href="https://fave.co/36Ap6yd">HTC’s Vive Focus 3</a> isn’t intended for the casual consumer. The $1,300 price point alone puts it on another level, likely best for business users who should be pleased with the superior hardware, ergonomics and build quality. Devindra Hardawar says the system has just about everything you would want in a modern headset: a sturdy yet light build with a design that’s comfortable to wear for long periods of time, and even has support for large glasses.</p><p>With a 5K resolution, a 90Hz refresh rate and a 120-degree field of view, the Vive Pro 2 delivered one of the most immersive standalone VR experiences that Devindra has seen. He had a realistic sense of walking through meadows and beaches in a nature trek VR program, and said he was consistently impressed by how great everything looked. However, he was disappointed by the limited software library that required him to remove the headset to purchase apps and games. After his time with the Focus 3, Devindra heartily felt that it is an ideal set up for companies who can take advantage of the business-focused apps and the hardware quality without cringing at the price point.</p><h2>The SkulptSynth SE is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/modal-electronics-skulptsynth-se-review-virtual-analog-170031324.html">a formidable sound engine</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2db64c40-f3a4-11eb-aaf7-3621e0a8d368" alt="Modal Electronics SkulptSynth SE" data-uuid="c27a8af5-d3bb-3a6d-aec6-dedc56b7aafe"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>As a follow up to the original Skulpt, the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:SkulptSynth SE" href="https://fave.co/3l5Z1zn">SkulptSynth SE</a> makes some upgrades to the build quality but comes in more affordable at $199. Terrence O’Brien spent some time with the instrument and determined that it’s still as powerful, compelling and confusing as the previous version. The SE features a total of 32 oscillators stacked in four voices which produces a thick tone that Terrence called inviting. He says the SE shines when the stacked oscillators are given a chance to really flesh out the sound. He also approved of the various modulation options, which give the device a surprising amount of depth.</p><p>Despite the improvements in the hardware (specifically firmer knobs), Terrence said that the SE still felt pretty wobbly and cheap overall. And he was still frustrated by the cramped layout and the navigation of the controls — he recommends keeping the included cheat sheet at hand to help with the latter. Additionally, the touch keyboard wasn’t always super responsive. However, using the app solved a lot of his complaints and he was excited about the MPE support, which is unheard of at the SE’s price point.</p><h2>Intel’s NUC 11 Extreme <a href="https://www.engadget.com/intel-nuc-11-extreme-review-practical-tiny-gaming-desktop-pc-130041721.html">offers gamers a full sized GPU</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/02366650-f033-11eb-9dbf-a36902acb4c4" alt="Intel NUC 11 Extreme mini gaming desktop" data-uuid="d3aa09bc-49ae-3c93-bf3b-44ecdd6faba6"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Devindra Hardawar/Engadget</div></figure><p>Devindra Hardawar is quick to acknowledge that the new <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:NUC 11 Extreme" href="https://fave.co/2VLRlZa">NUC 11 Extreme</a>, aka “Beast Canyon,” is pretty sizable. However, he feels the trade-off is worth it because the design provides support for a full GPU — something that should attract gamers to the unit. It’s also a bit cheaper than the last model and more flexible due to the fast 11th-gen Intel CPU (which can be purchased separately as an upgrade for NUC 9 Extreme owners).</p><p>This NUC was clearly designed with gamers in mind with an LED skull on the black metal case, mesh air vents and three large fans on top. Devindra was pleased to report that the case cooling on the device was excellent: the GPU never went above 75 celsius and the CPU stayed under 80 celsius. Additionally, because of the thoughtful modular design, he had no trouble fitting in large GPUs like NVIDIA’s RTX 3070 Ti or the Radeon RX 6800. The system also performed well in benchmark testing: in PCMark 10 it outpaced every Windows PC we’ve seen this year. Still, the $1,150 to $1,350 price tag for the NUC 11 is high, especially because owners will need to pay up for additional hardware and software.</p><h2>The Novation Circuit Rhythm is <a href="https://www.engadget.com/circuit-rhythm-review-a-solid-and-affordable-sampler-groovebox-130026004.html">entirely sample-based</a></h2><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-07/44ecbdb1-eb32-11eb-ad6f-51f9f1a6a517" alt="Novation Circuit Rhythm" data-uuid="8bdda6e8-edaf-314f-9add-82d6eb07d1ff"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Terrence O&#39;Brien / Engadget</div></figure><p>Though physically similar to its cousin the Circuit Tracks, <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Novation&#x002019;s Circuit Rhythm" href="https://fave.co/3sdLDLf">Novation’s Circuit Rhythm</a> uses the popular screen-free workflow of the Circuit with the full-featured sampler and performance effects of the SP-303 to produce a device that is ideal for lo-fi hip hop and house music. Terrence O’Brien particularly enjoyed this simple workflow as well as the sampling and slicing features that are fun to use.</p><p>The Circuit Rhythm has 32 RGB, velocity-sensitive pads, 28 buttons for switching views and tracks, eight endless encoders and two knobs for volume and master filter. Terrence says those eight monophonic sampler tracks are the core of the Rhythm, and he was also impressed with its portability and 3.5-hour battery life. Though he would like to see some additional features like more fine-grained temp control, overall he deemed the Circuit Rhythm a strong contender for best entry-level sampler, particularly for anyone interested in hip hop or house music creation.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/icymi-we-listened-to-samsungs-150-galaxy-buds-2-160043512.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">3862e8bf-a331-4166-ad64-862bd2d0d7c1</guid><dc:creator>Amber Bouman</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 16:00:43 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628877064</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T17:51:26+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Amber Bouman]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d375e0-faa6-11eb-bc6f-ea61e8b7666d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/51d375e0-faa6-11eb-bc6f-ea61e8b7666d" width="1600" height="1067" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Billy Steele/Engadget]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[With the Galaxy Buds 2, Samsung adds active noise cancellation to its most affordable true wireless earbuds.

Tap the button and you&#39;ll see a swipeable video collection from both the subreddits you&#39;ve subscribed to as well as related communities. As usual, you can upvote, downvote, comment on or gift awards.</p><p>A basic version of this experience was available before, but only if you tapped on a video — and the first videos you&#39;d see would come from the same subreddit. The new tab is meant to &quot;bring community through video,&quot; according to a Reddit spokesperson, and that means creating a &quot;unified&quot; experience that matches what you expect from app-based video players.</p><span id="end-legacy-contents"></span><p>Reddit didn&#39;t say when all iOS users could expect the feed, or when you&#39;d see an Android version. The vido section first reached a handful of iOS devices sometime in July.</p><p>This isn&#39;t a shocking move. Reddit started <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-08-19-reddit-livestreaming-trial-rpan.html">toying with livestreams</a> in 2019, and <a href="https://www.engadget.com/reddit-bought-tik-tok-rival-dubsmash-113916703.html">bought TikTok rival Dubsmash</a> in December 2020. While that company&#39;s code isn&#39;t being used for the feed (that will come with future products), the acquisition signalled Reddit&#39;s intent — it wants to keep its social network relevant in an era when video is all-important. You might not see video take center stage, but it&#39;s now considerably more than a nice-to-have feature.</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/reddit-tiktok-video-feed-154754721.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">597fcd5d-006f-43ee-bf88-fdfeaadd72e7</guid><dc:creator>Jon Fingas</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:47:54 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628956076</ingested><modified>2021-08-14T15:48:25+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Jon Fingas]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/83a0ce30-fd10-11eb-bbff-c613d2be23d9" width="5861" height="3906" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/83a0ce30-fd10-11eb-bbff-c613d2be23d9" width="5861" height="3906" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[Yuriko Nakao via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[KATWIJK, NETHERLANDS - JANUARY 29: In this photo illustration, the logo of Reddit, a social news aggregation is pictured along with other apps, including Instagram and WhatsApp on a smartphone on January 29, 2021 in Katwijk, Netherlands.

It introduced a new proprietary typeface and increased contrast to make buttons and other visual elements like images stand out. Just because those changes make the website more accessible for some people, though, doesn&#39;t mean they work for everyone. As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/13/twitters-web-redesign-isnt-as-accessible-as-it-should-be-experts-say/?tpcc=ECTW2020"><em>TechCrunch</em></a> and <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/twitters-new-font-chirp-is-apparently-giving-some-users-headaches/"><em>CNET</em></a> note, complaints started pouring in after the update went out, with people reporting eye strain and headaches caused by the changes. Now, the social network has announced that it&#39;s adjusting its buttons&#39; contrast levels to make them easier on the eyes.&nbsp;</p><div id="ee52a2e8b84e44809bb8ded09c643195"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We&#39;ve identified issues with the Chirp font for Windows users and are actively working on a fix.

But the presence of this installation comes at a price: due to the telescope&#39;s exceeding sensitivity, virtually every device and appliance that emits radio waves, Wi-Fi signals, or microwave radiation is banned for square miles around. That means that Green Bank, West Virginia has about as much tech today as it did in the 1950&#39;s (maybe even a little less) — and some people very much like it that way. But not everybody. In the excerpt below, Pocahontas County attorney, Robert Martin, recounts the challenges of attempting to modernize the region without loosing a horde of gentrifiers upon it as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/acc7e940-fc5e-11eb-aded-3513edb78a29" style="height:2700;width:1800;" alt="The Quiet Zone cover" data-uuid="a85ebc00-15f1-3e54-9b29-33522580f444"><figcaption></figcaption><div class="photo-credit">Harper Collins</div></figure><p><em>Excerpted from the book </em><a href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/the-quiet-zone-stephen-kurczy?variant=32959295422498"><em>THE QUIET ZONE: Unraveling the Mystery of a Town Suspended in Silence</em></a><em> by Stephen Kurczy.

In early 2018, the Pocahontas County Commission passed a resolution in support of cell service throughout the county, a challenge to the very notion of a Quiet Zone. The commission assigned its attorney, Robert Martin, to contact all major telecommunications providers asking them to invest in Pocahontas.</p><p>“I’m doing my level best to get another company in here,” Martin told me in the spring of 2018. He’d invited me to his house to discuss the new cell service ordinance, and we were swigging Bud Lights at his kitchen table.</p><p>“How many cell companies have you written to?” I asked.</p><p>“All of them,” he said. “I promised the companies that we’ll get everybody in the damn county to sign up with them. I’ll sign up first! . . . I wrote a letter to everybody and said, ‘We have shit for cellphone service here, we want you to come in here, we’ll partner with you, we’ll help you however we can. Come in here.’”</p><p>At our feet were two boxers and a basset hound. In the adjacent mudroom was a 250-pound Vietnamese potbellied pig named Pig, who was snoring. Pig knew how to open the front door and pull a blanket over himself. “I’m the true image of West Virginia, aren’t I?” Martin laughed. “I got a pig living in the house.” Despite his home literally being a pigsty, Martin was always the best dressed at county meetings, usually wearing tight designer jeans, leather boots, and a crisp dress shirt, top buttons undone and a few chest hairs curling out. A blustery guy, Martin was once jailed in Marlinton for contempt of court for arguing with a circuit judge. He had a history of getting into fights at West Virginia University football games. For years, he’d also operated a hotel in Belize, paying “tens of thousands of dollars in bribes” and putting the payments on his tax returns so the U.S. government could see the corruption he was dealing with (even if he was admitting to violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act). Martin came across as a dogged lawyer who knew how to get things done. And he wanted cell service.</p><p>“You seen that commercial saying Verizon has more coverage than anyone else?” he asked me. “Pause and look at it real closely, and you’ll see right where Pocahontas County is because almost the entire Eastern Seaboard is all yellow [signifying cell coverage] and right there in southeastern West Virginia there’s this hunk about this big—it’s Poca-fucking-hontas County. I swear to God. Right fucking there we are on Verizon’s commercials.”</p><p>Martin knew well what connectivity was like outside the Quiet Zone. He had earned his law degree from West Virginia University in 1979, married a girl from Marlinton, and started his career in Pocahontas County before becoming a well-heeled insurance defense lawyer in Charleston. He’d gotten his first cellphone in 1986—it was the size of a beer bottle, with a three-foot-long antenna, and it went to bed with him every night. That attachment ended in 2012 when he moved back to Pocahontas, where he only carried an iPhone so he could listen to music in his truck. I asked if he was concerned about the impact of cell service on the electrosensitives.</p><p>“Wackos that are afraid of their brains getting fried and all that?” he responded. “Yeah, I know about them.”</p><p>“They see Green Bank as a haven,” I said.</p><p>“So? <em>So?</em>” He said he wasn’t going to let the electrosensitives keep Pocahontas “behind the curve” for cell service.</p><p>“But I’m here <em>because </em>you’re behind the curve,” I said. “That makes this place unique.”</p><p>“You think we want to deal with stone knives and axes for the rest of our existence? You’re like these fucking people who move in here and don’t want it to change, that it? We have people who have moved here in the last five to ten years and they don’t want anything to change. They’ve ‘discovered’ Pocahontas County and now <em>nothing </em>can change. Well, <em>fuck, </em>that ain’t the way of the world. We have limitations because of the observatory, because of our topography, because of our insignificant population. But we need to do what we can as government entities to make things available to people.”</p><p>“Of course,” Martin added, the cell service would have to comply with the Quiet Zone.</p><p>“We believe in the observatory, we don’t want to fuck with them,” he said. “Right now, as you and I are sitting here bullshitting, they’re up there looking for fucking E.T. And I want to give them every opportunity to do that. But I’ve got emergency services I’ve got to render in this county.”</p><p>In addition to trying to bring in cell service, Martin was assisting the county’s emergency services director, Michael O’Brien, to improve communications. The 911 center in Marlinton had difficulty broadcasting any emergency radio communications toward the northern end of the county, where Green Bank was located. O’Brien found a partial solution by installing an internet-controlled radio system just north of Green Bank in the town of Durbin, but it had minimal range and failed altogether when internet or electricity went down. Pocahontas was also one of the only counties in the state unable to adopt a “smart radio system” that integrated radios with smartphones.</p><p>On the off chance that someone made an emergency 911 call from one of the county’s few pockets of limited cell service, authorities had an especially hard time pinpointing the person’s location. “We had a dispatcher spend two and a half hours on the phone one night with a lady that was trapped in her car in a creek,” O’Brien told me. “She didn’t know where she was or how she got there. We were just keeping her calm while we sent the department to look in all the areas that had cell service.”</p><p>ACCORDING TO DELOIT TE, a 10 percent increase in mobile penetration increases total factor productivity—a key component of economic growth modeling—by 4.2 percentage points over the long run. In Pocahontas, businesspeople like Kenneth “Buster” Varner felt they needed all the help they could get to keep the county’s economy puttering along, which meant bringing in cell service.</p><p>I first met Varner in early 2017, while eating breakfast at the counter at Station 2. A heavy, jowly man, he had leaned over and asked, “Do you think the gravy is too salty?” As we shoveled down heaping plates of biscuits and sausage gravy, he told me about his various businesses. Aside from owning Station 2, he operated a half dozen enterprises involved in logging, excavation, towing, septic pumping, and auto repair. He was also a fire chief. I told him that I imagined a lot of headaches trying to manage all those things within the restrictions of the Quiet Zone.</p><p>“You have to realize that we never had cellphone service when everybody else had it, so it wasn’t anything to us,” Varner said. “It’d be more convenient, of course, if it was so you could use your cellphones all the time. But it’s a unique place to live where you don’t have them, and we take a little pride in that.” He noted how the observatory provided jobs and shared its resources, such as lending one of its diesel generators to a funeral home during a recent power outage. “That to me means a lot,” Varner said. “And having the largest telescope in the world out your back door, that’s a pretty neat conversation piece.”</p><p>“People can get ahold of me the old-fashioned way,” he added. “Call me on the landline or come look for me.”</p><p>Spending more time with Varner, however, I realized that he was hardly a Luddite. When we met again months later in his cluttered office, I found it hard to keep his attention. He kept glancing down at his iPhone to check texts and alerts he was receiving over WiFi. When he took a call, I was left to stare at a poster of a busty woman in a red bikini and firefighter helmet. When he finally put down the iPhone, I told him I was confused. Hadn’t he said he took pride in not using a cellphone?</p><p>“I thought it was rude to have a smartphone,” Varner said of his “old” perspective, apparently from just a few months earlier. “I do a lot of business on that phone, more than I ever thought in my wildest dreams that I would do.” I asked if he could ever go back to living without one. “Wouldn’t want to. It’s so handy.”</p><p>Varner had an AT&amp;T data plan. He used Siri. He wished all his employees and volunteer firefighters could always be connected through smartphones. Instead, because of the Quiet Zone, he’d invested more than $30,000 in a specially approved radio repeater system to allow his workers to communicate via low-band radio. “I don’t want the observatory to close and for people to lose their jobs,” he said, “but it’d be more convenient for everybody.”</p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/hitting-the-books-the-quiet-zone-stephen-kurczy-harper-collins-153030420.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">288be526-c0d1-4fe0-8bea-7df5ae2d1e3b</guid><dc:creator>Andrew Tarantola</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 15:30:30 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628880763</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T18:52:55+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Andrew Tarantola]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2faf94d0-fc63-11eb-a676-c495d7097fc4" width="3400" height="2275" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-08/2faf94d0-fc63-11eb-a676-c495d7097fc4" width="3400" height="2275" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[The Washington Post via Getty Images]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[GREEN BANK, WV-JUNE 07: The Robert C.

These gadgets come with high price tags, but you can grab either of them for less right now at Wellbots. The online retailer has the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:Roomba i7+" href="https://fave.co/3dN1lpL">Roomba i7+</a> for $699, or $100 off, and the <a data-i13n="elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:;elmt:skimlinks;pdid:S9+" href="https://fave.co/3e1JhZm">S9+</a> for $949, or $150 off, when you use the codes <strong>100ENGADGET</strong> and <strong>150ENGADGET</strong>, respectively, at checkout.

Not only did it do a good job cleaning both carpeted and hard floors, but it was also quieter than other robot vacuums we&#39;ve tested. The i7+ also has smart mapping technology so it can keep track of the rooms in your home to clean more efficiently. And like other robo-vacs, you can control the i7+ from your smartphone, plus set cleaning schedules, using the iRobot mobile app.</p><p>But the biggest thing that sets the i7+ apart from others is its clean base. After each job, the robot will automatically empty its bin into the clean base so you don&#39;t have to worry about it. The clean base itself can hold about 30 jobs worth of dirt, so it won&#39;t require constant attention either. The only downside are iRobot&#39;s proprietary bags that you&#39;ll have to buy for it.</p><p>Overall, the i7+ is a good pick if you want a robot vacuum that requires little attention on a daily basis. The Roomba S9+ has all of the same features plus a more corner-friendly design and &quot;power-lift suction,&quot; which should help it do a better job deep-cleaning carpets and capturing pet hair.</p><p><em>Follow </em><a href="https://twitter.com/EngadgetDeals"><em>@EngadgetDeals</em></a><em> on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.</em></p>]]></description><link><![CDATA[https://www.engadget.com/irobot-roomba-i7-plus-s9-plus-deal-wellbots-130005973.html?src=rss]]></link><source_id>engadget_479</source_id><guid isPermalink="false">99ece9ac-a06f-4e1a-ab10-93881db30595</guid><dc:creator>Valentina Palladino</dc:creator><source><![CDATA[Engadget]]></source><dc:publisher>Engadget</dc:publisher><dc:rightsHolder>Engadget</dc:rightsHolder><pubDate>Sat, 14 Aug 2021 13:00:05 +0000</pubDate><ingested>1628880609</ingested><modified>2021-08-13T18:50:22+00:00</modified><category><![CDATA[Consumer Discretionary]]></category><category><![CDATA[Robots]]></category><category><![CDATA[Technology & Electronics]]></category><category><![CDATA[site|engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[provider_name|Engadget]]></category><category><![CDATA[region|US]]></category><category><![CDATA[language|en-US]]></category><category><![CDATA[author_name|Valentina Palladino]]></category><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/2fb150e0-0a60-11eb-8eaf-ababb0cbeb12" width="640" height="411" medium="image"><media:keywords>headline</media:keywords><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[1]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[]]></media:title></media:content><media:content url="https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/2fb150e0-0a60-11eb-8eaf-ababb0cbeb12" width="640" height="411" medium="image"><media:media_html><![CDATA[]]></media:media_html><dc:identifier><![CDATA[2]]></dc:identifier><media:credit><![CDATA[]]></media:credit><media:description><![CDATA[]]></media:description><media:title><![CDATA[iRobot&#39;s high-end Roomba i7+ and S9+ are up to $150 off at Wellbots]]></media:title></media:content></item><item><title><![CDATA[Warner Bros.

According to <a href="https://www.protocol.com/newsletters/next-up/warner-bros-deepfake-movie-promo?rebelltitem=1#rebelltitem1"><em>Protocol</em></a>, a media startup called D-ID created the promo for the film.
